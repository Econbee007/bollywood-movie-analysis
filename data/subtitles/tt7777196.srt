1
00:05:05,577 --> 00:05:10,413
You can see behind me, the
crowd has gathered at Lucknow Airport.

2
00:05:10,482 --> 00:05:13,247
The situation is pretty
tense all over Lucknow City.

3
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:14,462
What's the crowd gathered for?

4
00:05:14,486 --> 00:05:18,252
The entire city of Lucknow
has transformed into a campsite.

5
00:05:18,323 --> 00:05:19,154
What did he do'?

6
00:05:19,224 --> 00:05:20,820
Remember the Babri
Masjid (Mosque) case?

7
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:21,376
Yeah.

8
00:05:21,426 --> 00:05:22,018
That was him.

9
00:05:22,093 --> 00:05:23,671
You can pretty much sum up
how high profile this case <i>is...</i>

10
00:05:23,695 --> 00:05:25,220
from the crowd that's gathered here.

11
00:05:25,297 --> 00:05:26,607
Someone's coming
all the way from Mumbai?

12
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:27,996
Is it Amitabh (Bachchan)?

13
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:30,727
Who has been accused of
the Babri Masjid demolition.

14
00:05:31,002 --> 00:05:32,898
But he wasn't involved in the
Babri Masjid Demolition?

15
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:33,552
Wasn't he?

16
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:35,471
No, but he was supporting
the ones that did.

17
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,566
The entire country has
It's eyes on today's judgment.

18
00:05:38,643 --> 00:05:41,704
His supporters have gathered
around in large numbers...

19
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,248
just to catch a glimpse of him.

20
00:05:43,281 --> 00:05:45,272
But if he hadn't lent his support...

21
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,561
then this country
would still be burning!

22
00:05:46,585 --> 00:05:50,647
This is going to turn out
as the most different scenario...

23
00:05:50,722 --> 00:05:52,349
in Indian Politics.

24
00:05:53,558 --> 00:05:55,287
Greeting. Greeting. Greeting.

25
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:04,127
The CBI Lawyer claims
that the Babri Structure...

26
00:06:06,004 --> 00:06:08,234
Was he actually involved?

27
00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:11,338
- Long live...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

28
00:06:11,476 --> 00:06:14,070

00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:29,292

00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:41,003
Section 152A IPC,
Promoting Enmity between classes.

36
00:06:41,072 --> 00:06:42,072
Move back. Move back.

37
00:06:42,107 --> 00:06:43,199
Can't you hear?
Move back.

38
00:06:43,275 --> 00:06:49,408
150B, imputation, Assertion,
prejudicial to National Integration.

39
00:06:49,481 --> 00:06:51,643
Move back. I said move back.

40
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,076
And 505... False Statement...

41
00:07:00,258 --> 00:07:02,659
Rumors, etcetera, circulated,

42
00:07:02,727 --> 00:07:07,961
with the intent to cause mutiny,
or disturb public peace...

43
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:10,263
and being charged for the same.

44
00:07:13,605 --> 00:07:16,006

49
00:08:23,441 --> 00:08:26,342
Please state your full
name to the honorable Court.

50
00:08:30,215 --> 00:08:31,273
Bal...

51
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:32,449
Keshav...

52
00:08:33,184 --> 00:08:34,184
Thackeray!

53
00:08:47,665 --> 00:08:49,261
Make sure you deposit the cheque today.

54
00:08:49,286 --> 00:08:50,522
Thank you. Thank you, Sir.

55
00:08:52,771 --> 00:08:55,206
Rosy, did you get the
front-page layout yet?

56
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:56,684
- Find out whether they did or not.
- Okay, Sir.

57
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,369
The classified in
Free Press is confirmed.

58
00:08:58,443 --> 00:09:00,070
Just fax me the designs.

59
00:09:00,145 --> 00:09:01,203
Okay, sir.

60
00:09:04,215 --> 00:09:06,411
Govind, serve me filter coffee.

61
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:12,515
Here you go, Deshpande.

62
00:09:14,526 --> 00:09:16,807
There's a Memorial Service
at the Town Hall today at 7 pm.

63
00:09:18,463 --> 00:09:22,400
One of us dies and all we do is observe two
minutes of silence to pay our respects.

64
00:09:22,634 --> 00:09:23,726
We should be ashamed.

65
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:26,231
In fact, we shouldn't
stay silent about this at all!

66
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,130
Calm down, Thackeray.

67
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:34,172
We're lucky that we're the only
Maharashtrians in this entire office.

68
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:35,642
That's not good luck at all,

69
00:09:35,713 --> 00:09:37,112
It's out bad luck!

70
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:39,249
Sir.

71
00:09:40,718 --> 00:09:41,718
Back again?

72
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
The boss is calling you.

73
00:09:48,693 --> 00:09:49,693
Jairam,

74
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:52,187
How does it look'?

75
00:09:54,132 --> 00:09:57,466
I can never make
sense of your drawings.

76
00:09:58,136 --> 00:10:00,161
But it does make me laugh.

77
00:10:00,772 --> 00:10:03,298
You can't make sense
of my caricatures, can you?

78
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:05,670
Do one thing...

79
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:10,749
Laugh your heart out first.

80
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:12,708
Now imagine this...

81
00:10:13,284 --> 00:10:14,649
First, visualize a watermelon...

82
00:10:16,454 --> 00:10:17,649
Then add spectacles,

83
00:10:27,332 --> 00:10:29,198
Now try to imagine who this is?

84
00:10:33,037 --> 00:10:34,505
Sit. Mr. Thackeray.

85
00:10:35,573 --> 00:10:36,802
I said sit.

86
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,483
Your cartoons are becoming
sharper nowadays.

87
00:10:47,252 --> 00:10:49,687
I am pleased to know that
you understand my cartoons.

88
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:51,355
Thank you.

89
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:56,354
Stop going after that S K Patil!

90
00:10:56,561 --> 00:10:59,587
That NijLing Appa calls
me more than my wife in a day.

91
00:11:01,232 --> 00:11:02,996
And Morarji is completely off limits.

92
00:11:03,368 --> 00:11:05,496
You start a fire,
while I have pay the price.

93
00:11:07,172 --> 00:11:10,107
Thackeray,
This 'Press' is not for you alone.

94
00:11:11,543 --> 00:11:14,535
It's the breadwinner
for countless other families.

95
00:11:15,146 --> 00:11:17,478
So please stop trying to shut it down.

96
00:11:19,784 --> 00:11:22,549
If you restrict me
from using all my models...

97
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:25,355
then who am I going
to use for my caricatures?

98
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:32,524
Thackeray,
I have no doubt about your skills,

99
00:11:33,331 --> 00:11:37,666
but this 'Press' depends on
Advertisements and Good Relations.

100
00:11:38,503 --> 00:11:40,703
Why are you trying to ruin
the equations of my business?

101
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,660
I know you think you're your own boss.

102
00:11:43,808 --> 00:11:45,435
But I've superiors to answer to.

103
00:11:46,277 --> 00:11:47,637
It's me who has to face the music.

104
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:50,077
I love my job.

105
00:11:50,415 --> 00:11:53,612
That's the problem, Sir.
People love their jobs...

106
00:11:53,685 --> 00:11:54,685
No one loves their work!

107
00:11:56,521 --> 00:11:59,582
You can love your work,
and let me do my job.

108
00:12:00,058 --> 00:12:02,755
I am tired of explaining to you,
but you don't get it...

109
00:12:03,027 --> 00:12:07,055
I... I am an artist and
not some labourer!

110
00:12:13,504 --> 00:12:14,504
Hello.

111
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,401
Yes, sir.

112
00:12:17,275 --> 00:12:18,299
Yes, sir.

113
00:12:19,043 --> 00:12:20,563
Done, sir. Done, sir.
Will be done sir.

114
00:12:22,046 --> 00:12:24,071
Yes, sir.

115
00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:25,449
Yes, sir.

116
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:27,776
Good day, sir.

117
00:12:30,054 --> 00:12:31,054
Thackeray.

118
00:12:32,423 --> 00:12:34,016
Thackeray, at least listen to me.

119
00:12:38,796 --> 00:12:40,127
What the hell is this?

120
00:12:41,132 --> 00:12:42,132
What...

121
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,159
If you don't like my cartoons, then
my cartoons won't like you either.

122
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:48,130
And this is my resignation!

123
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:54,411
Get out!

124
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,275
No, the proof we got
last time wasn't right.

125
00:13:28,646 --> 00:13:30,205
I mean I need to talk to them.

126
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:30,747
Literature.

127
00:13:31,015 --> 00:13:32,676
- Sure.
- Let's go.

128
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,605
Tickets. Tickets. Tickets.

129
00:14:03,681 --> 00:14:05,012
Buy one.

130
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,313
Tickets.
Tickets, tickets! Dirt-cheap.

131
00:14:07,385 --> 00:14:09,581
Tickets. Tickets. Tickets.

132
00:14:23,735 --> 00:14:25,999
Tickets. Tickets. Tickets.

133
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,368
Tickets. Tickets. Tickets.

134
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:31,500
Balcony. Balcony. Balcony. Balcony.

135
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:33,134
Looks like a Cheapskate.

136
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:37,441
Tickets. Tickets. Tickets.

137
00:14:42,754 --> 00:14:44,153
Come on.

138
00:14:44,222 --> 00:14:45,519
Slowly. Slowly.

139
00:15:17,555 --> 00:15:20,650
We're lucky that we're the only
Maharashtrians in this entire office.

140
00:15:22,226 --> 00:15:22,988
Get out!

141
00:15:23,094 --> 00:15:25,153
That's not good luck at all,
It's out bad luck!

142
00:15:25,997 --> 00:15:27,641
We're lucky that we're the only
Maharashtrians in this entire office.

143
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:30,032
That's not good luck at all,
It's out bad luck!

144
00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:31,941
That's not good luck at all,
It's out bad luck!

145
00:15:32,003 --> 00:15:32,469
Get out!

146
00:15:32,537 --> 00:15:34,548
We're lucky that we're the only
Maharashtrians in this entire office.

147
00:15:34,572 --> 00:15:35,572
Get out!

148
00:15:35,673 --> 00:15:37,593
"Pancakes, Rice cakes,
Donuts, What do you want?"

149
00:15:38,576 --> 00:15:40,136
Marathi Manus:
"Can I get a cup of tea?"

150
00:15:45,383 --> 00:15:46,748
"Your tea. And hurry up."

151
00:15:54,492 --> 00:15:56,017
"What are you two doing?"

152
00:15:56,093 --> 00:15:58,528
"You are spilling
your food all over me?"

153
00:16:09,574 --> 00:16:11,702
"Hey Ghati, get up. That's my seat."

154
00:16:13,644 --> 00:16:14,644
"My seat."

155
00:16:17,281 --> 00:16:18,749
"Move aside."

156
00:16:25,256 --> 00:16:27,691
"The market's opens today at Rs.4.50."

157
00:16:27,758 --> 00:16:30,318
"The market's opens today at Rs.4.50."

158
00:16:30,394 --> 00:16:32,522
"Hurry up. Place your bids."

159
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,308
"What's a Maharashtrian
doing in a Share Market."

160
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:35,697
"Will you please move, sir."

161
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:38,629
- "Hey Marathi, where's my tea?"
- "Coming, sir."

162
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,502
- "My money."
- "Money? What money?"

163
00:16:41,572 --> 00:16:43,563
- "My money."
- "Get lost?"

164
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:46,110
- "My money."
- "Get out of my face."

165
00:16:46,511 --> 00:16:49,173
- "My money."
- "Get out of my face."

166
00:17:02,493 --> 00:17:04,484
Hey sonny boy.

167
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:05,528
Khan Sir?!

168
00:17:05,596 --> 00:17:08,031
You borrowed money from
me and are celebrating Diwali?

169
00:17:08,566 --> 00:17:11,058
And who's going to pay
interest for that money?

170
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:12,101
My money...

171
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:13,193
My money!

172
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:09,069
"Milk to the Bhaiyas (UP-Ians)"

173
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:10,437

"Meat to the Muslims,"

178
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,468
'And yet this is a diverse India!'

179
00:18:18,002 --> 00:18:19,122
'They own the newspapers...'

180
00:18:19,236 --> 00:18:21,715
'...but they need a Maharashtrian
to deliver it from door to door.'

181
00:18:21,739 --> 00:18:23,002
'This is not done.'

182
00:18:23,574 --> 00:18:26,544
'We must show them that
Maharashtrians can be Ghati...'

183
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:28,101
'...but they are not cheap.'

184
00:18:30,081 --> 00:18:31,480
'You're an outsider.'

185
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:36,078
'Whereas Mumbai and Maharashtra
belong to the Maharashtrians .'

186
00:18:37,455 --> 00:18:38,479
Are you blind?

187
00:18:59,377 --> 00:19:00,970
You're not ready yet?

188
00:19:01,345 --> 00:19:03,006
It slipped my mind, but...

189
00:19:07,451 --> 00:19:08,451
I quit my job yesterday-

190
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,055
Isn't it enough that he told us today?

191
00:19:32,743 --> 00:19:33,972
Father.

192
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:39,343
So, what are planning to do next?

193
00:19:40,618 --> 00:19:43,280
I am thinking of starting
a weekly caricature magazine.

194
00:19:47,425 --> 00:19:48,620
Srikant will assist me.

195
00:19:52,396 --> 00:19:53,396
No need to worry.

196
00:19:53,998 --> 00:19:55,659
This runs in our blood.

197
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,590
Take me for instance.

198
00:19:57,668 --> 00:20:01,434
I kept others closer than my kin.

199
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,508
And earned everything in
this lifetime, except for money.

200
00:20:05,142 --> 00:20:08,669
But honestly,
all I can give you, is my blessings.

201
00:20:10,114 --> 00:20:11,240
What about the money?

202
00:20:28,532 --> 00:20:30,626
'What language is your magazine?'

203
00:20:30,701 --> 00:20:33,170
'You won't get a loan
for a Marathi magazine.'

204
00:20:33,204 --> 00:20:35,502
Hey, listen. This is not our policy.'

205
00:20:35,573 --> 00:20:36,597
'I am sorry, okay.'

206
00:20:36,674 --> 00:20:40,235
'We want to stay in the market.
Not go out of business.'

207
00:20:42,113 --> 00:20:43,774
'What about the mortgage?'

208
00:20:44,048 --> 00:20:46,312
'Marathi Magazine.
Who is going to read it?'

209
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:47,417
Two...

210
00:20:47,451 --> 00:20:49,510
Gopal, you're heading to Gaay Wadi,
aren't you?

211
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:50,587
Yes, brother.

212
00:20:51,088 --> 00:20:52,522
Keep these in the storeroom.

213
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,751
Take these along as well.

214
00:20:53,824 --> 00:20:55,588
And don't forget to collect the money.

215
00:20:57,261 --> 00:20:58,558
Please come in.

216
00:20:59,163 --> 00:21:00,062
Greetings.

217
00:21:00,097 --> 00:21:02,361
- How are you, Bajirao?
- Fine.

218
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:03,764
What brings you here, Bal?

219
00:21:04,401 --> 00:21:06,301
We're thinking about
starting a Weekly Magazine.

220
00:21:06,337 --> 00:21:07,337
I see.

221
00:21:07,404 --> 00:21:09,668
We've been to numerous banks, but...

222
00:21:10,207 --> 00:21:12,291
I am sure father told you everything...

223
00:21:12,316 --> 00:21:13,177
Yes, he did.

224
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,268
We'll...

225
00:21:17,448 --> 00:21:18,779
need some money.

226
00:21:19,316 --> 00:21:20,340
How much do you want'?

227
00:21:21,218 --> 00:21:22,218
5,000

228
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,115
5, 000?

229
00:21:23,187 --> 00:21:24,227
But, we'll return it soon.

230
00:21:25,122 --> 00:21:26,590
5,000...

231
00:21:26,724 --> 00:21:27,418
5,000

232
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:29,220
How is Prabodhankar?

233
00:21:30,594 --> 00:21:31,594
He's fine.

234
00:21:32,763 --> 00:21:33,763
Here you go?

235
00:21:34,598 --> 00:21:35,598
Here you go?

236
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:37,133
Count it.

237
00:21:38,068 --> 00:21:39,068
And two more...

238
00:21:40,638 --> 00:21:41,638
Here you go.

239
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,544
Uncle, this is 5,200.

240
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,900
Here's your 200 rupees back.

241
00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:53,569
We'll need your blessings, Uncle.

242
00:21:54,518 --> 00:21:56,748
It should start with a bang.

243
00:21:57,822 --> 00:22:00,182
What did you say you are
going to call your Weekly Magazine?

244
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:16,462
On this auspicious occasion,

245
00:22:17,174 --> 00:22:21,338
I would like to request
the Chief Minister of Maharashtra...

246
00:22:22,246 --> 00:22:29,551
Mr. Yeshwant Rao Chauhan,
to inaugurate 'Marmik' (Poignant)!

247
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:52,167
A Respected Speaker, Photographer,

248
00:22:53,277 --> 00:22:54,277
Writer,

249
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:55,545
Teacher,

250
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,280
Editor...

251
00:22:58,449 --> 00:23:04,479
and the holder of many more such
titles and honor and my dear friend...

252
00:23:05,222 --> 00:23:08,248
Mr. Prabhodhankar's
son has started 'Marmik'.

253
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:11,226
And I am extremely delighted about it.

254
00:23:11,528 --> 00:23:15,522
After seeing the cover
page of 'Marmik' I am assured...

255
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:23,437
that it will only add to
my friend Prabhodhankar's glory.

256
00:23:25,242 --> 00:23:26,573
In fact, this issue is so good...

257
00:23:26,744 --> 00:23:30,374
that pretty soon the citizen
of Maharashtra will address him...

258
00:23:30,447 --> 00:23:32,211
as the father of Bal Thackeray.

259
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,352
Although the magazine is
named 'Marmik'...

260
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:42,157
but its humor is pretty sharp.

261
00:23:42,526 --> 00:23:43,526
And serious.

262
00:23:44,628 --> 00:23:47,359
One can deduce all that
by simply watching the cover page.

263
00:23:48,032 --> 00:23:52,162
And I can only hope that 'Marmik'
will be read in every home...

264
00:23:52,336 --> 00:23:54,703
- in Maharashtra.
- Wait, I am coming too.

265
00:24:10,487 --> 00:24:13,252
You can't even sleep
peacefully around here.

266
00:24:14,158 --> 00:24:17,651
Why in the world did he
have to move the board around?

267
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:19,685
Stupid.

268
00:24:28,172 --> 00:24:29,435
Yes, I am Thackeray!

269
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:33,075
After reading my articles
and seeing my cartoons...

270
00:24:33,143 --> 00:24:34,903
you all must be wondering
who is this man?

271
00:24:35,412 --> 00:24:37,176
The wrong guy who tells the truth.

272
00:24:37,715 --> 00:24:39,183
Is he some gangster?

273
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,431
If being outright honest is a crime,
then I am a criminal.

274
00:24:43,454 --> 00:24:46,515
I would rather snatch my rights
then beg for them like an a****!

275
00:24:51,695 --> 00:24:54,255
A man's strength and courage...

276
00:24:54,331 --> 00:24:56,356
is not measured by
the size of his chest.

277
00:24:58,502 --> 00:25:00,231
His strength lies in his mind...

278
00:25:00,304 --> 00:25:01,784
which we have leased it to others.

279
00:25:02,406 --> 00:25:05,006
Then may it be the Mughals...
the British, or any other Outsiders.

280
00:25:07,478 --> 00:25:10,311
We just stand there with our hands
folded, like we don't have a spine.

281
00:25:11,315 --> 00:25:12,373
Saluting them...

282
00:25:14,251 --> 00:25:15,309
Salutations Anna.

283
00:25:15,386 --> 00:25:16,285
Salutations Penna.

284
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,320
Salutations lyer.

285
00:25:17,354 --> 00:25:18,354
Am I right, Uncle?

286
00:25:20,157 --> 00:25:21,634
If you're our guest,
we've respect and honor for you...

287
00:25:21,658 --> 00:25:23,183
and welcome you with open arms.

288
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,096
But if someone tries to take our jobs,
and steal our food...

289
00:25:27,364 --> 00:25:29,244
then we can raise
These folded hands as well.

290
00:25:33,704 --> 00:25:36,332
And we're done folding hands,
It's time we broke their arms.

291
00:25:37,074 --> 00:25:38,318
We're done giving
them respect and honor.

292
00:25:38,342 --> 00:25:39,241
Did you hear?

293
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:40,469
Does violence solve anything?

294
00:25:41,412 --> 00:25:44,507
These bloody South Indians...

295
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,711
They are always together.

296
00:25:48,385 --> 00:25:49,318
They drink together.

297
00:25:49,386 --> 00:25:50,751
They help each other in business.

298
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:53,821
And we spend most of our lives doing
more harm than good to each other.

299
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,251
You can stay if you like,
but I am leaving.

300
00:25:59,196 --> 00:26:00,357
We'll show him tomorrow.

301
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,333
They hire their own people
even to clean their dishes.

302
00:26:07,204 --> 00:26:10,265
And when one of us starts a business,
do you know what we say?

303
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:14,073
"Less salt. Less oil."

304
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,512
When are you going to rekindle
that fire in your heart?

305
00:26:21,218 --> 00:26:22,549
We're done felicitating them.

306
00:26:23,687 --> 00:26:25,587
Its time to strike, where it hurts!

307
00:26:27,658 --> 00:26:31,390
It's how he started,
by giving provocative speeches.

308
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:35,465
Provoking younger generations,
sparking riots, that was his...

309
00:26:35,532 --> 00:26:37,193
Can you do something
about the loud noise?

310
00:26:37,668 --> 00:26:38,668
What?

311
00:26:39,436 --> 00:26:41,700
Can you do something about
the loud noise from the fan?

312
00:26:43,774 --> 00:26:45,538
Order! Order! Order!

313
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,007
Turn this fan off.

314
00:26:53,417 --> 00:26:56,011
When things go bad,
they make a lot of noise.

315
00:26:57,454 --> 00:26:58,478
How old are you'?

316
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:00,200
What kind of a pointless
question is that?

317
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,487
But still, what is your age?

318
00:27:05,462 --> 00:27:06,258
35 years old.

319
00:27:06,396 --> 00:27:07,396
35 years old.

320
00:27:08,432 --> 00:27:10,696
At the age of 35, you're a lawyer,

321
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:13,563
You're representing the CBI in court.

322
00:27:14,104 --> 00:27:15,104
And that's good.

323
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:20,434
But you are standing here today
because you received good education.

324
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:28,213
But when someone more educated than you can't
afford one square meal for his family...

325
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:31,511
then you realize the
true meaning of hunger.

326
00:27:32,623 --> 00:27:34,455
And when you've no
means to douse that fire...

327
00:27:34,992 --> 00:27:37,273
it in-turn burns the entire
society down to the ground.

328
00:27:37,628 --> 00:27:40,029
Silence, please! Silence!

329
00:27:42,132 --> 00:27:44,362
You've always been
a supporter of violence.

330
00:27:44,434 --> 00:27:44,764
Definitely not.

331
00:27:45,035 --> 00:27:47,355
Obviously, there will always be
a reaction to every action.

332
00:27:47,638 --> 00:27:49,436
Only Marathi signboards allowed.

333
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,535
Rice cakes... Pancakes... Crepes...

334
00:27:54,611 --> 00:27:56,705
Strike, where it hurts!

335
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,579
Strike, where it hurts!

336
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,516
These people deserve this.

337
00:28:01,618 --> 00:28:02,618
Exactly!

338
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,947
These outsiders take our jobs.

339
00:28:07,691 --> 00:28:10,524
Everyone single one of
them needs to be thrashed.

340
00:28:11,962 --> 00:28:12,962
This isn't right.

341
00:28:14,064 --> 00:28:15,691
You think violence will get us jobs?

342
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:17,733
Ae...

343
00:28:18,468 --> 00:28:22,427
Every day, you wear your tie and wander from
pillar to post, but did you get a job yet?

344
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,208
'You didn't, did you?'

345
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:27,062
'And you are never going to find one.'

346
00:28:27,611 --> 00:28:32,378
'If we still do nothing,
these outsiders will sc*** us.'

347
00:28:33,317 --> 00:28:37,618
'We will get jobs when their
glasses come shattering down.'

348
00:28:38,288 --> 00:28:39,983
'No vacancy.'

349
00:28:40,023 --> 00:28:41,218
Not qualified.

350
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:43,259
'...that's what you're fit for.'

351
00:28:43,327 --> 00:28:45,455
'... no qualification, no job.'

352
00:28:45,629 --> 00:28:51,068
'They are not qualified
enough to get a job.'

353
00:28:51,168 --> 00:28:54,365
'But, if you know a maid,
then, send her over to my house.'

354
00:28:54,438 --> 00:28:57,408
'No, we don't employ Maharashtrians .'

355
00:29:07,551 --> 00:29:09,076
The glass is broken.

356
00:29:09,152 --> 00:29:11,052
- Oh no...
- Run! Run!

357
00:29:11,154 --> 00:29:12,365
Why did you hit it so hard, uncle?

358
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:13,389
Oh, Lord...

359
00:29:13,624 --> 00:29:14,955
What's going on down there?

360
00:29:15,025 --> 00:29:16,151
Stop playing Cricket.

361
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,689
And, who broke the glass?

362
00:29:17,961 --> 00:29:19,122
It wasn't me.

363
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:21,491
It was sir.

364
00:29:21,565 --> 00:29:23,192
No, I did not. Such a tattle-teller.

365
00:29:23,267 --> 00:29:24,598
You're too much.

366
00:29:26,036 --> 00:29:28,266
The broken glass has
scattered all over the place.

367
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:30,405
Who's going to clean this up now?

368
00:29:30,674 --> 00:29:33,006
Come on, let us play.

369
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:36,674
You're just too much.

370
00:29:38,682 --> 00:29:40,013
Ball...

371
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,642
- Out. Out. You're out.
- No, I am not.

372
00:29:41,718 --> 00:29:43,083
That was a six.

373
00:29:43,153 --> 00:29:44,273
- That was a six.
- Out. Out.

374
00:29:44,421 --> 00:29:45,354
I am not giving up the bat.

375
00:29:45,422 --> 00:29:46,753
Come on, Come on.

376
00:29:47,024 --> 00:29:48,423
He's not going to give up the bat.

377
00:29:49,026 --> 00:29:50,221
Come on, let's play.

378
00:29:50,427 --> 00:29:51,588
You Play».

379
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,191
And I clean up this mess.

380
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,729
Wait. I'll check.

381
00:30:03,507 --> 00:30:04,565
Wait a minute.

382
00:30:05,742 --> 00:30:06,742
What do you want?

383
00:30:07,444 --> 00:30:09,071
- I want to meet Thackeray.
- What for?

384
00:30:09,146 --> 00:30:10,146
Duttaji...

385
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,676
I am Bal Thackeray.

386
00:30:14,785 --> 00:30:17,305
Shall I come down to your Police
Station, or can we talk inside?

387
00:30:19,489 --> 00:30:20,547
We'll come inside.

388
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:22,383
Come.

389
00:30:22,592 --> 00:30:23,753
Let's go inside.

390
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:25,754
Let the kids play outside.

391
00:30:26,463 --> 00:30:27,463
Come in.

392
00:30:45,682 --> 00:30:49,482
Your speeches have caused a great deal
of loss to the South Indian community.

393
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,940
We've received a number of complaints.

394
00:30:52,055 --> 00:30:53,489
Those complaints are against me.

395
00:30:53,557 --> 00:30:55,168
You should have arrested me.
Why come all the way...

396
00:30:55,192 --> 00:30:58,059
- So... you're here to arrest me.

397
00:30:58,128 --> 00:30:59,128
No.

398
00:30:59,796 --> 00:31:01,560
The Udupi Hotels have
suffered huge losses.

399
00:31:01,765 --> 00:31:04,291
We must file a case
against a couple of people.

400
00:31:04,468 --> 00:31:07,597
You Know... we've to deal
with tremendous pressure.

401
00:31:08,071 --> 00:31:10,130
And even our seniors are outsiders.

402
00:31:10,741 --> 00:31:13,540
But, I like your method...

403
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,578
which is why I wanted
to meet you first.

404
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:19,671
You know we can't take
sides because of this uniform.

405
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:24,284
These outsiders come
to our state and rule over us...

406
00:31:24,354 --> 00:31:25,354
I know all about it.

407
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:27,743
I've been through it myself.

408
00:31:29,693 --> 00:31:31,183
I'll have to make a report.

409
00:31:31,461 --> 00:31:33,623
But you won't face any problems.

410
00:31:35,298 --> 00:31:36,298
See you.

411
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,601
Good bye.

412
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,330
Good bye.

413
00:31:41,371 --> 00:31:42,371
Let's go.

414
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:48,500
But sir, DCP sir sent
us here to investigate.

415
00:31:49,246 --> 00:31:52,705
Shinde, when one of us
is thinking about our benefit...

416
00:31:52,749 --> 00:31:56,481
then you don't investigate him,
you think about his comfort.

417
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,259
Marmik's latest edition.

418
00:32:04,327 --> 00:32:05,488
Read and Do nothing about it!

419
00:32:05,562 --> 00:32:06,586
Give me One Marmik.

420
00:32:16,506 --> 00:32:17,234
Marmik.

421
00:32:17,307 --> 00:32:18,103
Marmik's latest edition.

422
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,437
Read and Do nothing about it!

423
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:21,102
Marmik's latest edition.

424
00:32:21,178 --> 00:32:22,703
Read and Do nothing about it!

425
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,220
What?

426
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,479
- Is Thackeray sir at home?
- Yes.

427
00:32:33,757 --> 00:32:34,690
- Grandpa.
- Yes.

428
00:32:34,724 --> 00:32:37,352
- Someone here to see you.
- Who is it?

429
00:32:49,272 --> 00:32:53,038
- Yes? What do you want?
- Are you Mr. Bala Sahab Thackeray?

430
00:32:53,777 --> 00:32:55,142
<i>Mr. Baa Sahab.</i>

431
00:32:55,445 --> 00:32:57,140
Yes, he's here.

432
00:32:57,514 --> 00:32:58,811
Bala Sahab is at home.

433
00:32:59,082 --> 00:33:00,106
Let me call you.

434
00:33:00,183 --> 00:33:01,617
<i>Baa Sahab...</i>

435
00:33:02,986 --> 00:33:04,681
Someone here to see you.

436
00:33:04,988 --> 00:33:06,012
Father...

437
00:33:07,691 --> 00:33:08,385
Yes.

438
00:33:08,592 --> 00:33:10,082
You're doing a good job.

439
00:33:11,027 --> 00:33:13,655
We always knew that Maharashtrians
were being exploited...

440
00:33:14,764 --> 00:33:16,698
but now we know who the exploiters are.

441
00:33:17,534 --> 00:33:21,198
Sir, this is a list of the
outsiders in our office.

442
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,044
I would like to work with you, Sir.

443
00:33:34,084 --> 00:33:38,385
Sir, 10 days have passed. And my
daughter hasn't returned home yet.

444
00:33:39,055 --> 00:33:41,752
They say they got married and that too,
to a Muslim.

445
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:44,225
And they are living at Bhindi Bazaar.

446
00:33:44,761 --> 00:33:48,197
I beg of you, please
bring her back home.

447
00:33:48,298 --> 00:33:51,734
I've been struggling, for the
past 7 years for a water connection.

448
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:55,094
When he returns from the loo,
he keeps the in front of my house.

449
00:33:55,171 --> 00:33:56,691
I am not going to listen every time...

450
00:33:57,307 --> 00:33:58,307
So I dropped him.

451
00:33:58,341 --> 00:34:01,538
Bal, what's your stand
on this current situation?

452
00:34:01,611 --> 00:34:04,979
My wife hasn't been keeping well.

453
00:34:05,048 --> 00:34:07,676
You always speak against democracy.

454
00:34:07,717 --> 00:34:09,276
This is my area, that one's theirs...

455
00:34:09,352 --> 00:34:11,252
I am taking him back
only on your order.

456
00:34:11,321 --> 00:34:13,187
If you can make a call to DCP sir...

457
00:34:13,256 --> 00:34:15,190
There's a huge prayer
meet in our society.

458
00:34:18,762 --> 00:34:20,526
Don't you believe in Democracy?

459
00:34:20,597 --> 00:34:21,917
I will punch him, then and there!

460
00:34:22,032 --> 00:34:23,032
As well as free food.

461
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:24,744
You should publish
this in the Marmik once.

462
00:34:24,768 --> 00:34:26,463
You must do something about him.

463
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,080
And, I am saying this
pretty much in advance...

464
00:34:28,104 --> 00:34:29,663
I'll get transferred immediately.

465
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:32,436
But if he comes home drunk again,
then I will...

466
00:34:33,009 --> 00:34:37,446
Wouldn't it be right to say
what you're doing is also hooliganism?

467
00:34:38,114 --> 00:34:40,794
Are you going to keep dealing
with their problems at here at home...

468
00:34:41,117 --> 00:34:44,143
or, have you thought about starting
a different organization for them?

469
00:34:45,121 --> 00:34:45,713
Yes, father.

470
00:34:46,122 --> 00:34:47,122
At least not at home.

471
00:34:48,158 --> 00:34:51,398
But, in order to work for the benefit of
the people, I'll have to go amongst them.

472
00:34:53,763 --> 00:34:55,094
We must bring them together.

473
00:34:56,066 --> 00:35:01,061
And for that,
we must build an organization.

474
00:35:02,072 --> 00:35:04,973
For the Marathis,
for Mumbai, for Maharashtra.

475
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,339
Then what are you waiting for?

476
00:35:09,479 --> 00:35:10,571
Sooner the better.

477
00:35:11,281 --> 00:35:13,306
- Ramesh, go get a coconut.
- Okay.

478
00:35:15,085 --> 00:35:17,144
Sister-in-law,
you arrived at the right occasion.

479
00:35:17,554 --> 00:35:18,554
Occasion?

480
00:35:19,255 --> 00:35:20,255
What occasion?

481
00:35:20,423 --> 00:35:21,703
For building a new organization.

482
00:35:22,158 --> 00:35:23,158
I see.

483
00:35:23,693 --> 00:35:24,319
That's great.

484
00:35:24,394 --> 00:35:26,761
Sister-in-law, send some sweets.

485
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,293
Okay.

486
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:32,499
We've decided to build
a new organization.

487
00:35:34,371 --> 00:35:37,773
But... what will we be the name
of the new organization?

488
00:35:38,008 --> 00:35:39,048
Have you thought about it?

489
00:35:39,342 --> 00:35:41,709
Name? Well, the name...

490
00:35:43,279 --> 00:35:45,145
I haven't thought
anything about the name?

491
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,549
Father, why don't you suggest
a name for the organization?

492
00:35:50,687 --> 00:35:51,687
What organization?

493
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,281
We'll lead an army.

494
00:35:57,427 --> 00:36:00,362
Take the name of King
Shivaji Maharaj and go ahead.

495
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:06,233
- Glory to...
- Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj!

496
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:11,969
- Glory to...
- Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj!

497
00:36:12,108 --> 00:36:16,409
- Glory to...
- Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj!

498
00:36:16,513 --> 00:36:21,144
- Glory to...
- Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj!

499
00:36:30,427 --> 00:36:34,364
- Hail Bhawani!
- Hail Shivaji!

500
00:36:34,464 --> 00:36:38,025
- Hail Bhawani!
- Hail Shivaji!

501
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:43,005
- Long live...
- Shiv... Sena!

502
00:36:43,106 --> 00:36:47,373
- Long live...
- Shiv... Sena!

503
00:36:47,444 --> 00:36:50,038
- Glory to...
- Mahadev...

504
00:36:50,146 --> 00:36:54,310
- Long live...
- Shiv... Sena!

505
00:36:55,185 --> 00:37:00,646
Real men don't talk about compromise.

506
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:03,984
These are words are used by weaklings.

507
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:15,061
And this state of Maharashtra,
ls not a state of weaklings.

508
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:18,007
We're tigers.

509
00:37:21,444 --> 00:37:25,540
And whenever someone
tries to rattle a tiger...

510
00:37:26,049 --> 00:37:32,113
history has been a witness
of their consequences!

511
00:37:34,724 --> 00:37:35,724
<i>Ba“.!</i>

512
00:37:50,073 --> 00:37:54,032
My son here,
till today, was just a Thackeray.

513
00:37:54,444 --> 00:37:59,041
But now, this Bal
belongs to entire Maharashtra.

514
00:37:59,783 --> 00:38:02,343
I pledge him to the unified India.

515
00:38:02,418 --> 00:38:05,217
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

516
00:38:05,288 --> 00:38:08,019
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

517
00:38:08,057 --> 00:38:11,425
- Hail Bhawani!
- Hail Shivaji!

518
00:38:12,095 --> 00:38:16,191
To control the outsiders' intrude.

519
00:38:16,299 --> 00:38:20,133
Soon we will begin with
the enrollment for 'Shiv Sena'.

520
00:38:20,303 --> 00:38:22,203
Read the next edition of Marmik...

521
00:38:22,272 --> 00:38:24,138
for more information.

522
00:38:24,207 --> 00:38:27,006
Editor, Mr. Bal Thackeray.

523
00:38:33,516 --> 00:38:36,247
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

524
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:39,311
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

525
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:42,188
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

526
00:38:42,258 --> 00:38:44,590
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

527
00:38:44,661 --> 00:38:46,561
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

528
00:38:46,629 --> 00:38:49,326
- Glory to...
- Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj!

529
00:38:49,399 --> 00:38:52,425
- Glory to...
- Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj!

530
00:38:52,502 --> 00:38:55,631
- Glory to...
- Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj!

531
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,509
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

532
00:38:59,576 --> 00:39:02,204
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

533
00:39:02,278 --> 00:39:04,542
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

534
00:39:04,581 --> 00:39:06,515
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

535
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:09,211
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

536
00:39:09,285 --> 00:39:11,151
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

537
00:39:11,221 --> 00:39:13,713
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

538
00:39:14,557 --> 00:39:17,185
Uncle. Have a sweet?

539
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,661
Sir, please help me.

540
00:39:20,363 --> 00:39:21,159
What happened?

541
00:39:21,264 --> 00:39:26,065
You know, we've been in the milk business
since the time of our forefathers.

542
00:39:26,536 --> 00:39:28,336
I spent my hard earned
fortune to buy a house.

543
00:39:29,272 --> 00:39:30,967
2 years ago I rented the place out...

544
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,100
but, now they are refusing
to vacate the place.

545
00:39:33,142 --> 00:39:34,142
They?

546
00:39:34,277 --> 00:39:35,277
Who?

547
00:39:35,445 --> 00:39:36,445
He's some goon.

548
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:38,473
He's running a gambling den there.

549
00:39:39,616 --> 00:39:43,610
I went to reason with him,
but... he says we're 'His' men.

550
00:39:44,254 --> 00:39:45,254
"His"?

551
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:46,989
Who's He?

552
00:39:49,726 --> 00:39:50,726
<i>Baa Saheb.</i>

553
00:39:58,501 --> 00:40:01,732
Wait here, uncle. I'll talk to Sir.

554
00:40:04,741 --> 00:40:05,606
Move. Move.

555
00:40:05,675 --> 00:40:08,474
Sir, someone has forcefully
taken possession of his house.

556
00:40:09,145 --> 00:40:12,672
And they claim that they are "our" men.

557
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:15,408
- Note down his address.
- Yes, sir.

558
00:40:17,687 --> 00:40:18,449
Come, uncle.

559
00:40:18,521 --> 00:40:19,613
Give me the address.

560
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:23,625
Hand me a pen.

561
00:40:27,196 --> 00:40:28,686
Sutarwadi, Room no. 19.

562
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:32,327
Sir, this is a list of our nominees.

563
00:40:33,069 --> 00:40:34,069
Sir...

564
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:40,409
- Is this okay?
- Yes.

565
00:40:41,611 --> 00:40:45,809
Sir, are we contesting for
the Corporation elections?

566
00:40:46,082 --> 00:40:47,106
Yes, so?

567
00:40:48,117 --> 00:40:51,357
Are we going to be holding demonstrations
and picketing for the rest of our lives?

568
00:40:52,522 --> 00:40:55,355
How long are we going to
rally behind these Corporators'?

569
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,293
Now our Soldiers' will
become Corporators themselves...

570
00:41:00,363 --> 00:41:02,003
and work for the benefit of the people.

571
00:41:02,398 --> 00:41:04,992
But Sir, you never told us anything.

572
00:41:05,301 --> 00:41:06,301
Well, I just did.

573
00:41:08,237 --> 00:41:09,237
Now get to work.

574
00:41:14,377 --> 00:41:15,377
Sir...

575
00:41:18,181 --> 00:41:20,149
I am really indebted to you.

576
00:41:20,783 --> 00:41:24,777
Someone who troubles the
weak can never be one of us.

577
00:41:25,355 --> 00:41:26,220
Hail Maharashtra!

578
00:41:26,289 --> 00:41:27,289
Hail Maharashtra!

579
00:41:30,426 --> 00:41:31,426
Hail Maharashtra!

580
00:41:38,668 --> 00:41:41,569
- Hello?
- Hello. May I speak with Bala Saheb?

581
00:41:42,205 --> 00:41:45,140
- Who is this?
- Sister-in-law, this is Manohar Joshi.

582
00:41:46,409 --> 00:41:47,467
Just a minute.

583
00:41:47,744 --> 00:41:48,744
Joshi.

584
00:41:50,346 --> 00:41:51,438
Go ahead.

585
00:41:51,481 --> 00:41:55,145
Sir, Balwant Mane from our party...

586
00:41:55,218 --> 00:41:56,218
Speak freely.

587
00:41:56,486 --> 00:41:58,614
Sir, he...

588
00:41:59,155 --> 00:42:00,520
I said to speak freely.

589
00:42:01,124 --> 00:42:06,654
He's called for a meeting,
at Manwali Hall, at 5:30.

590
00:42:08,598 --> 00:42:11,033
Against... you.

591
00:42:12,402 --> 00:42:14,131
He's also distributing circulars.

592
00:42:15,605 --> 00:42:17,300
We must do something about him.

593
00:42:17,373 --> 00:42:18,373
Okay.

594
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:21,309
Okay.

595
00:42:25,748 --> 00:42:29,480
Our party's plan of action should
be decided with everyone's approval.

596
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,754
It's crucial to have
democracy within the party.

597
00:42:33,456 --> 00:42:38,018
We won't let Shiv Sena
be controlled by a handful few.

598
00:42:38,127 --> 00:42:39,338
We won't tolerate dictatorship.

599
00:42:39,362 --> 00:42:41,160
We won't...

600
00:42:41,731 --> 00:42:43,324
Let's show him.

601
00:42:43,399 --> 00:42:45,458
No! No! Leave me.

602
00:42:45,601 --> 00:42:47,467
Show him.

603
00:42:47,537 --> 00:42:50,598
No. Leave me.

604
00:42:58,514 --> 00:43:00,744
How dare you speak against Sir?

605
00:43:02,051 --> 00:43:06,181
Sir. Sir.

606
00:43:06,489 --> 00:43:09,584
I don't believe in petty democracy...

607
00:43:15,465 --> 00:43:16,728
in this Organization.

608
00:43:16,999 --> 00:43:19,058
So, are you against Democracy?

609
00:43:19,702 --> 00:43:21,295
Where is Democracy?

610
00:43:23,306 --> 00:43:25,026
Which Democracy are
you talking about to me?

611
00:43:27,677 --> 00:43:30,009
According to me,
only two types of democracy exist.

612
00:43:30,513 --> 00:43:33,039
One, where you stay
quiet and endure everything.

613
00:43:33,749 --> 00:43:36,069
Or the one where you don't
stay quiet and raise your voice.

614
00:43:36,486 --> 00:43:37,544
Fight!

615
00:43:37,687 --> 00:43:41,021
For your rights, and for justice.

616
00:43:43,326 --> 00:43:48,230
If the Law of this country is equal for
everyone, and everyone's treated equally...

617
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:54,466
and Democracy has one view for everyone, then
why wouldn't I believe in this Democracy?

618
00:43:56,439 --> 00:43:58,771
I agree different religions
have different Laws here.

619
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:04,240
If Democracy treats everyone the same way,
then why wouldn't I believe in Democracy?

620
00:44:04,313 --> 00:44:05,576
Even I believed in Democracy.

621
00:44:09,352 --> 00:44:14,449
When Kashmiri Pandits were driven out
of Kashmir, where was this Democracy?

622
00:44:15,591 --> 00:44:17,025
Isn't Kashmir a part of us?

623
00:44:19,529 --> 00:44:21,293
Aren't Kashmiri Pandits one of us?

624
00:44:23,633 --> 00:44:28,002
The water of Sutlej is causing
mutiny between Punjab and Haryana.

625
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,102
Even today the Marathi people
of Belgaum and Karwar...

626
00:44:35,211 --> 00:44:38,146
are demonstrating
to be a part of Maharashtra.

627
00:44:40,016 --> 00:44:46,319
Our Mumbai itself needed the sacrifice of
106 people to be a part of Maharashtra.

628
00:44:48,157 --> 00:44:49,784
Where was your democracy, then?

629
00:44:50,626 --> 00:44:53,493
How many more sacrifices will
it need in order to Keep it alive'?

630
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,137
We celebrate Republic
Day on 26th January.

631
00:45:02,271 --> 00:45:06,572
Where was your democracy
on one such 26th January?

632
00:45:06,642 --> 00:45:13,014
When countless
innocent lives was lost...

633
00:45:13,249 --> 00:45:16,446
Maharashtra should be a unified
state along with Belgaum and Karwar.

634
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:20,556
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

635
00:45:20,623 --> 00:45:24,560
- We want...
- Unified Maharashtra.

636
00:45:24,627 --> 00:45:27,028
We give an ultimatum
until 26th January.

637
00:45:28,264 --> 00:45:30,323
If the Belgaum issue
isn't solved until then...

638
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,960
then we warn the Chief
Minister of Maharashtra,

639
00:45:33,102 --> 00:45:35,822
Home Minister of the country, and
the Vice President Morarji Desai...

640
00:45:36,038 --> 00:45:38,598
that leave alone Mumbai,

641
00:45:41,077 --> 00:45:43,557
they will not be allowed even
within the limits of Maharashtra.

642
00:45:45,615 --> 00:45:48,175
Who does Thackeray
think he is, to put a ban on me?

643
00:45:49,352 --> 00:45:53,653
Mr. Yeshwant Rao, my tour
of Bombay will continue as scheduled.

644
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:56,615
Leave no dearth in your arrangements.

645
00:45:57,793 --> 00:46:01,525
Sir, his goons even
stopped his oar in Mumbai.

646
00:46:03,633 --> 00:46:06,261
There's excessive anger
amongst the people of Maharashtra.

647
00:46:07,336 --> 00:46:11,671
The people of Belgaum and
Karwar have come out on the streets.

648
00:46:11,741 --> 00:46:15,609
The decisions taken in the interest
of the country must be followed.

649
00:46:16,479 --> 00:46:19,505
If someone takes a decision
against the Government...

650
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:22,869
then he will be dealt with
in the language best known to him.

651
00:46:25,121 --> 00:46:26,282
If he fails to behave,

652
00:46:26,355 --> 00:46:29,075
then the Government will not
hold back in showing it's true power.

653
00:46:29,425 --> 00:46:31,587
Take utmost strict action if need be.

654
00:46:32,128 --> 00:46:36,395
Also, he is the one who inaugurated Bal
Thackeray's Weekly Magazine.

655
00:46:39,402 --> 00:46:41,234
Who does he really think he is?

656
00:46:44,707 --> 00:46:47,506
Gentlemen,
I don't care about any of this.

657
00:46:47,576 --> 00:46:48,702
I am coming to Bombay.

658
00:46:49,745 --> 00:46:51,440
Do whatever is necessary.

659
00:46:53,215 --> 00:46:54,649
Who is in charge of the Police?

660
00:46:54,717 --> 00:46:55,717
Modak.

661
00:46:56,252 --> 00:46:57,481
Is he a Maharashtrian?

662
00:46:57,553 --> 00:46:59,681
No, just a Maharashtrian surname.

663
00:47:00,189 --> 00:47:03,955
His full name is Emanuel Modak.

664
00:47:04,093 --> 00:47:06,425
Dutta Salvi. This is my last warning.

665
00:47:06,729 --> 00:47:08,094
Tell Mr. Thackeray...

666
00:47:08,497 --> 00:47:11,258
that I don't want to see any
of his boys anywhere near Mr. Morarji.

667
00:47:12,101 --> 00:47:13,101
His boys?

668
00:47:13,703 --> 00:47:17,298
Bala Saheb is personally going
to hand over his appeal to Mr. Morarji.

669
00:47:17,406 --> 00:47:20,103
So Mr. Morarji better
collect it personally.

670
00:47:20,409 --> 00:47:21,535
We have only one demand.

671
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:25,444
Belgaum, Karwar, is a part of Maharashtra,
still is, and always will be.

672
00:47:25,514 --> 00:47:26,538
Lower your voice.

673
00:47:26,615 --> 00:47:28,460
Don't forget you're talking
to a Deputy Commissioner.

674
00:47:28,484 --> 00:47:29,383
Understand.

675
00:47:29,485 --> 00:47:33,649
This is the lowest my voice can get.

676
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:35,290
<i>Outta...</i>

677
00:47:36,158 --> 00:47:37,169
Do you see how he's misbehaving'?

678
00:47:37,193 --> 00:47:38,126
What do you mean misbehaving?

679
00:47:38,194 --> 00:47:40,754
- Duttaji it'll be fine, just calm down.
- But...

680
00:47:43,032 --> 00:47:47,196
Look, sir, we want to hand
over this request very peacefully.

681
00:47:47,503 --> 00:47:48,503
Peacefully.

682
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:53,168
You just deliver our message to him,
that's all.

683
00:47:53,242 --> 00:47:55,682
But the Law and Order on that
day will be your responsibility.

684
00:47:55,745 --> 00:47:57,179
Fine, we'll see.

685
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:58,460
What do you mean we'll see?

686
00:47:58,614 --> 00:48:03,074
Well, it means that, if he accepts our request,
then Law and Order will be maintained.

687
00:48:03,152 --> 00:48:04,152
Yes.

688
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:08,390
Fine.

689
00:48:11,193 --> 00:48:12,683
I will convey your message to him.

690
00:48:13,729 --> 00:48:14,729
Thank you, sir.

691
00:48:14,964 --> 00:48:15,964
See you.

692
00:48:19,702 --> 00:48:23,536
- Why did you have to fold your hands?
- These things are necessary.

693
00:48:27,209 --> 00:48:29,701
Our Saheb shall personally
handover the appeal tomorrow.

694
00:48:29,979 --> 00:48:33,040
And Morarji must accept
it personally... understood.

695
00:48:33,082 --> 00:48:35,073
- And don't you forget it.
- Let's go, uncle...

696
00:48:37,987 --> 00:48:40,752
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb!

697
00:48:41,023 --> 00:48:43,993
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb!

698
00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:45,390
Back! Stay back!

699
00:48:45,461 --> 00:48:46,758
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb!

700
00:48:47,029 --> 00:48:51,466
- We want...
- We want Unified Maharashtra!

701
00:48:51,534 --> 00:48:55,630
- We want...
- We want Unified Maharashtra!

702
00:48:55,704 --> 00:49:00,471
- We want...
- We want Unified Maharashtra!

703
00:49:00,543 --> 00:49:03,638
- Go back...
- Morarji Go back!

704
00:49:03,712 --> 00:49:07,444
- Go back...
- Morarji Go back!

705
00:49:07,516 --> 00:49:11,111
- Go back...
- Morarji Go back!

706
00:49:11,187 --> 00:49:14,714
- Go back...
- Morarji Go back!

707
00:49:33,576 --> 00:49:36,307
If the cavalcade doesn't stop,
even we won't stay quiet.

708
00:50:05,107 --> 00:50:07,132
Saheb, what now?

709
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:09,441
Attention!

710
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,651
The convoy won't stop.

711
00:50:19,688 --> 00:50:20,688
Stop them!

712
00:50:21,524 --> 00:50:22,286
Stop.

713
00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:25,794
Saheb! They are saying that
Morarji's convoy won't stop here!

714
00:50:26,061 --> 00:50:29,224
Saheb, they are saying
that he won't accept the request!

715
00:50:39,742 --> 00:50:42,109
Stay back. Stay back.

716
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,047
Move. I said move.

717
00:50:53,088 --> 00:50:54,283
Sir, get in the car.

718
00:50:54,356 --> 00:50:56,484
Move. Move aside.

719
00:50:56,592 --> 00:50:58,720
- Forget about me, stop them.
- Sir, get in the car.

720
00:50:58,794 --> 00:51:00,728
We'll handle it here.

721
00:51:00,996 --> 00:51:02,395
Get in the car.

722
00:51:02,665 --> 00:51:03,723
Move.

723
00:51:03,999 --> 00:51:05,660
Get in the car.

724
00:51:06,602 --> 00:51:08,730
Control our Soldiers.

725
00:51:09,371 --> 00:51:11,430
Saheb, Dutta sir's here,
He will handle everything.

726
00:51:11,507 --> 00:51:13,441
Let me speak with the Police.

727
00:51:14,076 --> 00:51:15,076
Go.

728
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:16,441
Move. Move.

729
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:17,478
Let me get down.

730
00:51:17,546 --> 00:51:19,139
Stop the car. Stop the car.

731
00:51:20,182 --> 00:51:22,412
You leave.

732
00:51:25,454 --> 00:51:28,515
Come on, Modak.
Let's move. I said let's move now.

733
00:52:00,089 --> 00:52:03,457
Move aside. Move.

734
00:53:16,131 --> 00:53:20,090
This which I am carrying on my
shoulders, this is your Democracy.

735
00:53:22,271 --> 00:53:24,103
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

736
00:53:24,173 --> 00:53:25,766
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

737
00:53:26,041 --> 00:53:27,509
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

738
00:53:27,576 --> 00:53:29,305
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

739
00:53:29,378 --> 00:53:31,005
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

740
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,570
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

741
00:53:32,648 --> 00:53:34,377
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

742
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:36,145
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

743
00:53:36,218 --> 00:53:37,686
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

744
00:53:37,753 --> 00:53:39,380
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

745
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:41,514
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

746
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:43,080
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

747
00:53:45,194 --> 00:53:46,593
How much for the fruits'?

748
00:53:46,662 --> 00:53:48,756
Threads for sale.
Threads for sale.

749
00:53:49,298 --> 00:53:50,424
That's too much.

750
00:53:50,666 --> 00:53:52,760
No, it's completely right.

751
00:53:52,801 --> 00:53:55,168
Balasaheb's been jailed.

752
00:53:55,237 --> 00:53:56,136
Shutdown everything.

753
00:53:56,205 --> 00:53:58,105
You bloody... shut it down, I said.

754
00:53:58,173 --> 00:54:01,006
Balasaheb's been jailed.

755
00:54:02,411 --> 00:54:04,539
Balasaheb's been jailed.

756
00:54:31,106 --> 00:54:33,165
Vasant Rao, who is running Mumbai'?

757
00:54:33,509 --> 00:54:34,305
What are they doing?

758
00:54:34,376 --> 00:54:36,105
What the hell is
your Police Force doing?

759
00:54:36,645 --> 00:54:37,645
No, sir.

760
00:54:38,614 --> 00:54:40,174
We've deployed the entire Police Force.

761
00:54:40,616 --> 00:54:41,616
Everything is in control.

762
00:54:57,065 --> 00:55:00,262
But the report received at
the PMO is completely different.

763
00:55:10,479 --> 00:55:13,312
Vasant Rao, do what it takes,
but bring the situation under control.

764
00:55:13,549 --> 00:55:14,549
Please.

765
00:55:18,487 --> 00:55:20,251
I want Bombay peaceful again.

766
00:55:21,123 --> 00:55:22,123
Yes, sir.

767
00:55:30,299 --> 00:55:32,267
Call Modak.

768
00:55:37,673 --> 00:55:41,632
Now who's going to explain to
him that it's not in our hands?

769
00:55:43,245 --> 00:55:46,306
Only one man can calm down Mumbai,
right now.

770
00:55:48,717 --> 00:55:53,746
George, I had great faith in
Mr. Vasant Rao.

771
00:55:54,223 --> 00:55:57,284
But unfortunately, he gave in as well,
to pressure from Delhi.

772
00:55:58,427 --> 00:56:01,294
This country needs a dictator.

773
00:56:03,532 --> 00:56:04,590
One is born already!

774
00:56:05,734 --> 00:56:08,396
A dictator has already
taken shape in you.

775
00:56:13,709 --> 00:56:15,143
And you're saying this, George?

776
00:56:16,311 --> 00:56:18,678
Someone who never believed
in Democracy all his life.

777
00:56:18,747 --> 00:56:23,184
There was a time when you uprooted rail
tracks to protest against the Government...

778
00:56:24,052 --> 00:56:27,545
but not a word against
Them after our arrests.

779
00:56:27,623 --> 00:56:30,558
Why are you saying that?

780
00:56:32,027 --> 00:56:33,256
I did come here to see you?

781
00:56:34,062 --> 00:56:40,764
The government says that Shiv Sena should try
peaceful protests with Support of ideology.

782
00:56:41,036 --> 00:56:42,197
Peaceful protests?

783
00:56:44,072 --> 00:56:46,006
And how on earth do we do that...

784
00:56:47,042 --> 00:56:48,305
from behind these bars?

785
00:56:50,145 --> 00:56:53,479
Those who burnt the Bangalore Mail,
Madras Mail, are National Heroes.

786
00:56:53,649 --> 00:56:54,649
And we're Fascists.

787
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:56,550
Shoot at sight orders, really?

788
00:56:58,553 --> 00:57:00,214
Bloody sons of General Dire.

789
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:03,589
George, some water.

790
00:57:04,092 --> 00:57:06,390
Yes, he's pretty thirsty.

791
00:57:06,728 --> 00:57:08,560
I'll help myself.

792
00:57:10,699 --> 00:57:11,699
Here...

793
00:57:17,673 --> 00:57:22,702
Thanks to your Democracy,
69 of my boys were killed.

794
00:57:23,712 --> 00:57:26,257
Sir, some people are here to see
here from the Chief Minister's office.

795
00:57:26,281 --> 00:57:27,561
- Shall I...
- Yes, send them in.

796
00:57:30,585 --> 00:57:34,044
Bal, you must take care.

797
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:40,391
Now everyone knows that George isn't
the only one who can shut down Mumbai.

798
00:57:41,763 --> 00:57:44,528
When Bal Thackeray sets Mumbai ablaze...

799
00:57:44,733 --> 00:57:47,532
even Delhi feels the heat!

800
00:57:50,706 --> 00:57:52,333
You just be careful.

801
00:57:57,112 --> 00:57:58,112
George.

802
00:58:00,515 --> 00:58:04,975
Sometimes one needs a
spark to diminish the darkness.

803
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:10,368
I've heard there's a
curfew in Lalbaug as well?

804
00:58:10,392 --> 00:58:11,188
I heard that too.

805
00:58:11,259 --> 00:58:13,353
Some of Marmik's editions
had to be delivered.

806
00:58:14,129 --> 00:58:15,609
And I've asked Babban to do the same.

807
00:58:16,064 --> 00:58:17,691
- And...
- Thackeray, letter for you.

808
00:58:19,568 --> 00:58:21,195
I'll be right back.

809
00:58:23,405 --> 00:58:24,445
How are things, Kamble?

810
00:58:24,506 --> 00:58:25,506
I am fine.

811
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,380
Yes...

812
00:58:33,515 --> 00:58:36,177
Sau, Minas. Hail Maharashtra.

813
00:58:38,587 --> 00:58:40,747
'These days I've been receiving
a plethora of letters.'

814
00:58:42,758 --> 00:58:49,630
'All of them make me so emotional,
that they touch our hearts.'

815
00:58:52,234 --> 00:58:53,759
'And we feel overwhelmed.'

816
00:58:56,605 --> 00:58:59,336
'Such dedication, so much love.'

817
00:59:01,943 --> 00:59:03,263
'I received your letter as well.'

818
00:59:05,947 --> 00:59:08,177
'We must all face the situation.'

819
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:12,985
'I have only one regret.'

820
00:59:13,722 --> 00:59:18,250
'There's no one to advocate
Maharashtra in front of Delhi.'

821
00:59:21,329 --> 00:59:24,128
'A person like me who has
never even walked 10 steps...'

822
00:59:25,367 --> 00:59:30,669
'I have no idea or count of how many steps
I Keep pacing in my cell, every day.'

823
00:59:32,474 --> 00:59:36,433
'Thinking... Thinking... and
then thinking again.'

824
00:59:40,082 --> 00:59:41,481
'How is our Aquarium?'

825
00:59:43,452 --> 00:59:44,613
'How is Marshall?'

826
00:59:47,722 --> 00:59:51,625
Good to hear that Timba
and Binda are behaving properly.

827
00:59:54,663 --> 00:59:57,325
Think twice before sending
them to far off meetings.

828
00:59:58,366 --> 01:00:01,165
The Mumbai Police is heartless...

829
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:05,035
and they won't back down from
taking any action, anytime, anywhere...

830
01:00:05,173 --> 01:00:07,369
because their soul is dead.

831
01:00:09,277 --> 01:00:12,178
Tell the children to read
something nice in the afternoon.

832
01:00:14,516 --> 01:00:18,350
Bring them autobiographies
of great and successful.

833
01:00:20,388 --> 01:00:21,514
What about Srimit?

834
01:00:22,324 --> 01:00:25,259
I've heard he's handling
Marmik pretty well.

835
01:00:27,195 --> 01:00:29,562
He's been explained
all the important factors.

836
01:00:32,667 --> 01:00:35,107
The entire family's responsibility
is now on your shoulders...

837
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:42,203
and hearing how well you're
executing them is a treat to hear.

838
01:00:48,049 --> 01:00:51,451
Maa, you must take
care of yourself too.

839
01:00:55,624 --> 01:00:58,059
You didn't have tea yet.

840
01:00:58,326 --> 01:00:59,326
Neelu.

841
01:01:00,562 --> 01:01:01,562
Serve them this tea.

842
01:01:07,269 --> 01:01:08,395
Was that Saheb's letter?

843
01:01:09,237 --> 01:01:10,237
Yes.

844
01:01:13,475 --> 01:01:14,475
He's fine.

845
01:01:17,479 --> 01:01:21,040
People love me, is that my fault too?

846
01:01:21,383 --> 01:01:25,081
But Saheb, people are waging
war for the sake of that love.

847
01:01:26,087 --> 01:01:27,687
Bombay is under curfew,
and it's burning.

848
01:01:28,223 --> 01:01:31,284
Your men have closed clown schools,
colleges, factories.

849
01:01:33,695 --> 01:01:34,787
They are my boys.

850
01:01:35,597 --> 01:01:38,794
But Saheb, all this should stop now.

851
01:01:40,335 --> 01:01:42,804
We must restore Bombay
to what it was earlier.

852
01:01:43,405 --> 01:01:46,170
Saheb, this is a request.

853
01:01:46,374 --> 01:01:49,241
Only you can calm down Shiv Sainiks.

854
01:01:54,583 --> 01:01:56,142
Talk to the Chief Minister.

855
01:01:56,451 --> 01:01:57,509
The Prime Minister.

856
01:01:59,154 --> 01:02:00,634
They are the ones who have the power.

857
01:02:01,389 --> 01:02:04,120
Everyone knows who
controls power in Bombay.

858
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:08,724
Your intervention can fix the
Law and Order situation in Bombay.

859
01:02:09,598 --> 01:02:10,429
And now...

860
01:02:10,498 --> 01:02:12,125
And yes, sir...

861
01:02:12,734 --> 01:02:16,261
The CM has specially
sent you a message...

862
01:02:16,605 --> 01:02:20,439
that other organizations are
taking advantage of your agitation.

863
01:02:48,603 --> 01:02:51,698
"The Government has
called in the Indian Army..."

864
01:02:52,407 --> 01:02:54,501
"to maintain Law
and Order in Mumbai."

865
01:02:55,176 --> 01:02:57,338
"But I am very sad
and hurt to hear this."

866
01:02:58,346 --> 01:03:01,213
"Our army is for the
safety of our borders..."

867
01:03:01,283 --> 01:03:03,684
"and not to deal with
our internal conflicts."

868
01:03:05,086 --> 01:03:07,111
"This is not good for us at all."

869
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:11,121
"The country is always our
first priority, and then our state."

870
01:03:20,268 --> 01:03:23,568
"I call upon my Shiv Sainiks."

871
01:03:24,205 --> 01:03:30,167
"To come together and work towards bringing
peace and harmony back in the city."

872
01:03:30,779 --> 01:03:32,178
"And they must also make sure..."

873
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:37,042
"that entities like Lal Bhai
or any other organizations..."

874
01:03:37,552 --> 01:03:43,787
"don't take undue advantage
of our agitation and struggle."

875
01:03:44,793 --> 01:03:46,727
"Bal Thackeray."

876
01:03:48,496 --> 01:03:49,395
Control room.

877
01:03:49,497 --> 01:03:50,577
Control room. Control room.

878
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:53,131
There's a crowd of people
gathering at Parel Naka.

879
01:03:53,234 --> 01:03:54,531
They are carrying weapons.

880
01:03:54,636 --> 01:03:56,263
Please get there as soon as possible.

881
01:03:56,338 --> 01:03:57,338
Over.

882
01:04:30,338 --> 01:04:34,206
And this way, repeatedly the Police is just
watching helplessly, like an audience.

883
01:04:34,275 --> 01:04:36,505
Has the Government turned meek?

884
01:04:37,212 --> 01:04:40,045
How much lower is this
Government going to stoop...

885
01:04:40,115 --> 01:04:42,345
due to the fear of one man,
Mr. Speaker?

886
01:04:42,617 --> 01:04:45,314
This is not Democracy,
this is Dictatorship!

887
01:04:46,221 --> 01:04:50,180
Mr. Speaker,
this Government is forcing our Police...

888
01:04:50,458 --> 01:04:55,453
to bow before the same
man who sparked these riots.

889
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:57,020
Shame on this Government!

890
01:04:57,098 --> 01:04:59,430
Shame on them!

891
01:04:59,601 --> 01:05:04,596
Mr. Speaker, Law, and Order
in Bombay were in complete disarray...

892
01:05:04,672 --> 01:05:08,973
while this power-hungry
government was snoring away.

893
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:13,372
We doubt the role
that our Chief Minister played.

894
01:05:13,648 --> 01:05:17,414
And I sincerely request you,
in fact, I implore you...

895
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:20,682
to accept our non-confidence
motion immediately.

896
01:05:20,755 --> 01:05:23,281
Krishna Desai, your time is up.

897
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:26,123
Please sit down.

898
01:05:26,227 --> 01:05:28,491
Kalyan Rao is about
to give you a reply.

899
01:05:29,197 --> 01:05:31,723
Sit down. Sit down.

900
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:34,200
Your time is up.

901
01:05:53,788 --> 01:05:55,483
It's been so long
since we last came here.

902
01:05:58,526 --> 01:06:00,392
You hardly get the time.

903
01:06:01,729 --> 01:06:03,424
But I did today.

904
01:06:07,535 --> 01:06:08,535
Are you angry?

905
01:06:11,339 --> 01:06:13,364
I've no reason to be angry.

906
01:06:15,343 --> 01:06:17,107
Children eagerly await your return.

907
01:06:20,448 --> 01:06:21,448
And you?

908
01:06:26,588 --> 01:06:27,612
You know you're too much.

909
01:06:28,156 --> 01:06:29,385
Now, this is our life.

910
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:37,328
What can be better
than helping those in heed?

911
01:06:40,101 --> 01:06:44,538
But the fact that all
eyes are on us at all the time...

912
01:06:47,775 --> 01:06:49,504
is a little bit weird.

913
01:06:51,212 --> 01:06:52,212
Get used to it.

914
01:06:54,415 --> 01:06:55,644
You know what...

915
01:06:57,719 --> 01:06:59,710
earlier when I used to look at people...

916
01:07:01,356 --> 01:07:03,120
I used to see the humor in them.

917
01:07:03,958 --> 01:07:05,798
But now when I look at
the same people again...

918
01:07:06,694 --> 01:07:09,595
I see their pain,
their problems, and their questions.

919
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:17,534
Almost as if the artist
inside me is fading away.

920
01:07:23,545 --> 01:07:31,316
Hmm, along with that artist, even my
husband is getting lost in the crowd.

921
01:07:31,419 --> 01:07:32,250
Mother!

922
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,048
Hey...

923
01:07:33,121 --> 01:07:33,519
Mother!

924
01:07:33,588 --> 01:07:34,384
Where are you going?

925
01:07:34,455 --> 01:07:36,321
Not that way. Now in the water. No!

926
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:38,320
Not that way, dear.

927
01:07:40,461 --> 01:07:41,587
Don't cry, dear.

928
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:43,426
My child.

929
01:07:43,498 --> 01:07:44,608
You're with her, aren't you?

930
01:07:44,632 --> 01:07:46,066
You should be looking after her.

931
01:07:46,134 --> 01:07:46,566
Yes...

932
01:07:46,634 --> 01:07:48,329
- Can she swim?
- No.

933
01:07:48,403 --> 01:07:49,403
Then.

934
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,130
Balloons. Balloons.

935
01:07:54,342 --> 01:07:55,571
Only 10 cents.

936
01:07:55,643 --> 01:07:57,611
- Pintya, start the car.
- Sir...

937
01:07:58,279 --> 01:07:59,279
What?

938
01:08:00,949 --> 01:08:02,144
What do you want, son?

939
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:03,508
Autograph, please.

940
01:08:03,585 --> 01:08:04,585
Whose?

941
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,320
Her?

942
01:08:08,022 --> 01:08:09,148
No, Sir. Yours.

943
01:08:15,496 --> 01:08:17,487
- What is your name?
- Keshav.

944
01:08:19,334 --> 01:08:20,597
Just like my father.

945
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:25,205
- Which school, son?
- Gyaneshwar Vidya Mandir.

946
01:08:25,273 --> 01:08:27,264
- Which class?
- Class Four.

947
01:08:28,376 --> 01:08:30,276
- Do you know my name?
- Yes.

948
01:08:30,645 --> 01:08:32,374
- What is it?
- Tiger!

949
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,545
Tiger?

950
01:08:33,648 --> 01:08:35,207
He looks more like a rat.

951
01:08:35,483 --> 01:08:36,483
Exactly.

952
01:08:36,985 --> 01:08:40,011
Why did Mr. Naidu round
up all of us to kill this rat?

953
01:08:41,255 --> 01:08:43,451
- What's his name?
- Bal Thackeray.

954
01:08:44,058 --> 01:08:46,026
I've heard that he
practically controls Mumbai.

955
01:08:46,094 --> 01:08:47,118
Him?

956
01:08:47,328 --> 01:08:48,523
Are you kidding me?

957
01:08:51,666 --> 01:08:52,666
Naidu sir is here.

958
01:08:52,734 --> 01:08:53,734
Come on.

959
01:08:56,738 --> 01:08:59,673
Sir, some gangsters from
Nagpur are here to kill you.

960
01:08:59,741 --> 01:09:00,741
They are outside.

961
01:09:02,076 --> 01:09:03,134
Hand me my bag.

962
01:09:03,211 --> 01:09:04,211
Sir.

963
01:09:05,947 --> 01:09:08,109
- That's him, in there.
- Come on.

964
01:09:13,554 --> 01:09:14,554
I am Naidu.

965
01:09:15,289 --> 01:09:17,621
- Are you Bal Thackeray?
- Yes?

966
01:09:17,725 --> 01:09:18,725
So.

967
01:09:19,293 --> 01:09:20,293
We need to talk.

968
01:09:21,262 --> 01:09:22,262
We are.

969
01:09:23,698 --> 01:09:26,463
Not here, outside.

970
01:09:30,071 --> 01:09:32,071
What's so special outside?
Your wedding procession?

971
01:09:33,141 --> 01:09:34,540
You bloody...

972
01:09:35,309 --> 01:09:36,640
Hold him.

973
01:09:49,023 --> 01:09:50,023
Saheb, blood.

974
01:09:50,058 --> 01:09:51,058
Blood?

975
01:09:53,528 --> 01:09:55,360
You threw that garbage dump on me.

976
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:56,688
This is just tomato sauce.

977
01:09:57,265 --> 01:09:58,265
Let's clean this up.

978
01:10:03,104 --> 01:10:04,663
You bloody...

979
01:10:06,741 --> 01:10:07,741
I feel ashamed.

980
01:10:08,309 --> 01:10:10,277
I don't want my soldiers
to be afraid like these.

981
01:10:10,344 --> 01:10:11,436
I want fighters.

982
01:10:11,512 --> 01:10:13,002
But this attack?

983
01:10:14,449 --> 01:10:15,780
I don't know.

984
01:10:17,618 --> 01:10:19,746
These people live and breed here.

985
01:10:20,021 --> 01:10:21,716
But praise outsiders
like China and Russia.

986
01:10:23,157 --> 01:10:25,455
We'll have to get rid
of these baboons permanently.

987
01:10:27,161 --> 01:10:28,458
Puma. Come here.

988
01:10:29,063 --> 01:10:29,757
5 minutes.

989
01:10:30,031 --> 01:10:31,031
(Sta)'-

990
01:10:33,434 --> 01:10:34,560
Where's that sack?

991
01:10:53,054 --> 01:10:54,054
Where is he?

992
01:10:54,088 --> 01:10:54,782
In his office.

993
01:10:54,822 --> 01:10:55,550
Are there people around?

994
01:10:55,623 --> 01:10:56,681
No, not much.

995
01:10:59,193 --> 01:11:00,752
Puma, call him outside.

996
01:11:01,329 --> 01:11:02,329
Okay.

997
01:11:11,706 --> 01:11:12,764
- Desai sir?
- Inside.

998
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,008
I've called for a
meeting at Gate no. 4.

999
01:11:15,076 --> 01:11:17,670
I want everyone there at 8,
I'll be coming there.

1000
01:11:17,745 --> 01:11:21,613
Desai sir. We need to talk in private,
it's urgent.

1001
01:11:22,517 --> 01:11:23,917
- Prakash, see what he wants.
- Sir.

1002
01:11:24,018 --> 01:11:25,679
No, sir, I must talk only to you.

1003
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,120
Go take a look.

1004
01:11:27,321 --> 01:11:28,789
I want everyone there by 8.

1005
01:11:29,056 --> 01:11:30,056
Yes...

1006
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:31,458
All of you...

1007
01:11:48,643 --> 01:11:49,643
Desai sir didn't come.

1008
01:11:50,411 --> 01:11:52,743
We want to meet Krishna Desai.
Please call him.

1009
01:11:53,047 --> 01:11:54,124
He said I should talk to you.

1010
01:11:54,148 --> 01:11:56,412
I will tell him whatever it is.

1011
01:12:01,422 --> 01:12:02,422
Close it down.

1012
01:12:05,626 --> 01:12:07,025
What the...

1013
01:12:09,463 --> 01:12:12,228
- Tambe, bring me a torch.
- Right away.

1014
01:12:13,634 --> 01:12:15,602
- What?
- That's him.

1015
01:12:18,306 --> 01:12:21,401
- Who are they, Prakash?
- Some people from Jai Bharat.

1016
01:12:21,475 --> 01:12:23,569
Jai Bharat. Some people
to see you from Jai Bharat.

1017
01:12:23,644 --> 01:12:25,305
- Jai Bharat?
- Yes.

1018
01:12:25,379 --> 01:12:28,076
- What Jai Bharat.
- Don't know.

1019
01:12:28,516 --> 01:12:30,450
- I am from Lalbaug.
- Lalbaug?

1020
01:12:30,785 --> 01:12:31,785
From Jai Bharat.

1021
01:12:38,526 --> 01:12:41,223
Leave him. Let him go.

1022
01:12:41,395 --> 01:12:42,191
Comrade.

1023
01:12:42,263 --> 01:12:43,059
Comrade.

1024
01:12:43,097 --> 01:12:45,031
Come on. Get up.

1025
01:13:43,124 --> 01:13:44,319
Wait, you...

1026
01:13:44,392 --> 01:13:46,451
Where do you think you're going?

1027
01:13:46,661 --> 01:13:48,652
Trying to be over-smart?

1028
01:13:51,032 --> 01:13:52,397
Come on.

1029
01:13:52,466 --> 01:13:54,400
We'll show you. Come on.

1030
01:14:00,508 --> 01:14:02,602
- I'll show you.
- Come on.

1031
01:14:03,177 --> 01:14:06,203
- On whose orders did you kill him?
- I don't know.

1032
01:14:06,247 --> 01:14:09,308
- On whose orders did you kill him?
- I don't know.

1033
01:14:09,383 --> 01:14:13,616
- Who sent you?
- I don't know!

1034
01:14:54,636 --> 01:14:57,731
After the final countdown
of votes for Parel Constituency...

1035
01:14:57,806 --> 01:15:00,673
Sarojini Krishna
Desai is at 27, 788 votes

1036
01:15:00,775 --> 01:15:03,176
and Vaman Mahadik is at 29, 287 votes.

1037
01:15:03,211 --> 01:15:04,736
Hello.

1038
01:15:05,146 --> 01:15:06,580
Digu speaking.

1039
01:15:06,982 --> 01:15:09,849
Hello, Mr. Journalist. What's up?

1040
01:15:10,251 --> 01:15:11,811
It's been a while
since you last called.

1041
01:15:11,853 --> 01:15:16,791
Well, you know that my journalism
is incomplete without you.

1042
01:15:18,226 --> 01:15:20,923
- Is sir in?
- Let me check.

1043
01:15:23,865 --> 01:15:24,559
Hello, sir.

1044
01:15:24,632 --> 01:15:27,158
Sarojini Krishna Desai
is at 29, 913 votes

1045
01:15:27,235 --> 01:15:29,636
and Vaman Mahadi is at 31, 592 votes.

1046
01:15:29,704 --> 01:15:31,194
Congratulation, sir.

1047
01:15:31,272 --> 01:15:34,037
Since your candidate has won.

1048
01:15:34,275 --> 01:15:35,868
My candidate?

1049
01:15:37,078 --> 01:15:39,604
Well, I'll have to call
him your candidate now.

1050
01:15:39,748 --> 01:15:41,739
The Vasant Sena after all.

1051
01:15:44,085 --> 01:15:46,520
You're playing fine politics.

1052
01:15:46,821 --> 01:15:50,018
Instead of expanding
your own Congress Party...

1053
01:15:50,091 --> 01:15:52,219
you're encouraging others instead.

1054
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:57,120
I hope this doesn't come around
to bite you in the future.

1055
01:15:57,766 --> 01:15:59,996
We'll deal with it as it comes.

1056
01:16:00,068 --> 01:16:02,560
Shiv sena candidate.

1057
01:16:02,637 --> 01:16:05,663
Vaman Mahadik wins by 1679 votes.

1058
01:16:06,074 --> 01:16:08,668
Saheb, the first candidate has won.

1059
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:10,509
Congratulations.

1060
01:16:10,678 --> 01:16:12,772
- Can I come in?
- Come in, Dada Kondke. Come in.

1061
01:16:13,681 --> 01:16:14,681
So Dada.

1062
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:17,576
I heard that "Songadiya"
is breaking all records.

1063
01:16:19,687 --> 01:16:21,587
Speak freely, they are all like family.

1064
01:16:22,991 --> 01:16:26,689
Saheb, Songadiya was doing
tremendous business at Kohinoor.

1065
01:16:26,961 --> 01:16:27,587
What do you mean?

1066
01:16:27,662 --> 01:16:30,927
I requested the theatre authorities to
let it run for a couple of more weeks.

1067
01:16:30,999 --> 01:16:33,627
- And?
- They downright refused me.

1068
01:16:33,701 --> 01:16:35,863
They don't want to
show Marathi films anymore.

1069
01:16:35,937 --> 01:16:36,937
Why?

1070
01:16:37,138 --> 01:16:40,130
They want to run a Hindi film.

1071
01:16:40,642 --> 01:16:43,043
I went to Ministers, and everyone else.

1072
01:16:43,111 --> 01:16:44,840
But I didn't get help from anyone.

1073
01:16:45,046 --> 01:16:49,779
When Hindi film heroines strip their
clothes, everyone jumps up on their seats.

1074
01:16:49,851 --> 01:16:53,549
But they stripped down a Marathi film,
and no one came forward.

1075
01:16:53,621 --> 01:16:55,988
They stripped down my Marathi film.

1076
01:16:56,057 --> 01:16:57,923
If Marathi films don't
play in Maharashtra,

1077
01:16:57,992 --> 01:16:59,870
then will they play
South Indian films instead?

1078
01:16:59,894 --> 01:17:01,658
Now you please do something.

1079
01:17:01,729 --> 01:17:02,992
We are with you.

1080
01:17:03,064 --> 01:17:04,862
Waman Mahadik, go ahead.

1081
01:17:04,933 --> 01:17:07,197
We are with you.

1082
01:17:07,469 --> 01:17:10,700
Waman Mahadik, go ahead.
We are with you.

1083
01:17:10,772 --> 01:17:11,671
Welcome, Mr. MLA.

1084
01:17:11,739 --> 01:17:15,107
Waman Mahadik, go ahead.
We are with you.

1085
01:17:16,911 --> 01:17:18,470
I need your blessings, sir.

1086
01:17:24,052 --> 01:17:26,521
Saheb, I owe all this to you.

1087
01:17:26,621 --> 01:17:27,621
Congratulations.

1088
01:17:28,123 --> 01:17:29,648
Now, enough with the felicitations.

1089
01:17:30,191 --> 01:17:31,784
And let's go to Kohinoor theatre.

1090
01:17:32,193 --> 01:17:34,491
Kohinoor? Which show?

1091
01:17:34,929 --> 01:17:36,289
Today we're the star of this show.

1092
01:17:40,001 --> 01:17:42,663
The Film Industry was started
in this country by a Maharashtrian.

1093
01:17:43,171 --> 01:17:45,811
And today our Maharashtrian films
don't get a slot in the theatres.

1094
01:17:47,842 --> 01:17:52,006
- Long live...
- Shiv Sena!

1095
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,845
- Long live...
- Shiv Sena!

1096
01:17:57,185 --> 01:17:59,745
My home, my bed, and your dreams, huh?

1097
01:18:00,855 --> 01:18:02,220
This can't go on here now.

1098
01:18:04,759 --> 01:18:06,727
The Marathi people
have the first right here.

1099
01:18:10,932 --> 01:18:12,058
Then come, your dreams.

1100
01:18:14,602 --> 01:18:15,602
First come, my dreams.

1101
01:18:15,803 --> 01:18:20,604
- Marathi workers deserve jobs first...
- They do... They do...

1102
01:18:20,675 --> 01:18:25,772
- Marathi workers deserve jobs first...
- They do... They do...

1103
01:18:25,847 --> 01:18:30,114
- First right to the sons of this soil.
- Then the Outsiders!

1104
01:18:30,185 --> 01:18:34,247
- First right to the sons of this soil.
- Then the Outsiders!

1105
01:18:34,522 --> 01:18:39,483
- The sons of these soils must get a job first.
- They do...

1106
01:18:39,561 --> 01:18:43,759
- The sons of these soils must get a job first.
- They do...

1107
01:18:48,102 --> 01:18:48,898
Babban.

1108
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:50,450
- Long live...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray.

1109
01:18:50,538 --> 01:18:56,102
- Marathi workers deserve jobs first...
- They do... They do...

1110
01:19:01,015 --> 01:19:05,213
- Long live...
- Shiv Sena!

1111
01:19:26,507 --> 01:19:29,568
- Long live...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray.

1112
01:19:29,644 --> 01:19:33,137
- Long live...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray.

1113
01:19:33,214 --> 01:19:38,618
Mr. Nanda, the Marathi youngsters
have a right to these jobs first.

1114
01:19:39,587 --> 01:19:43,114
Yes, Mr. Thackeray.
But that is not our Central Policy.

1115
01:19:43,258 --> 01:19:47,252
Then... change your policy, Mr. Nanda.

1116
01:19:47,729 --> 01:19:49,197
But I must follow the rules.

1117
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:57,738
Mr. Nanda, maybe the skies where your
airplanes soar, belong to you...

1118
01:19:57,939 --> 01:20:01,967
but the streets you use
to get to your home, belong to me.

1119
01:20:05,813 --> 01:20:07,838
Are you threatening me?

1120
01:20:09,951 --> 01:20:11,510
This is not possible.

1121
01:20:20,128 --> 01:20:21,505
- How are you, Babban?
- Hail Maharashtra.

1122
01:20:21,529 --> 01:20:22,529
So you got bail.

1123
01:20:22,597 --> 01:20:24,691
- Happy Diwali.
- Same to you.

1124
01:20:30,138 --> 01:20:34,132
You made one phone call
and I got bail immediately.

1125
01:20:35,109 --> 01:20:36,873
Happy Diwali, Maa.

1126
01:20:37,011 --> 01:20:38,088
Don't leave without
eating something first.

1127
01:20:38,112 --> 01:20:38,704
Yes.

1128
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:40,544
- Is your mother keeping well?
- Yes, she is.

1129
01:20:41,182 --> 01:20:42,946
- Don't pick them up.
- What are you doing?

1130
01:20:43,251 --> 01:20:44,251
Take these.

1131
01:20:48,122 --> 01:20:50,216
Why did you have to
keep it in your pocket?

1132
01:20:56,030 --> 01:20:57,088
Babban, how are you'?

1133
01:20:57,165 --> 01:20:58,860
- Happy Diwali.
- Yes, Happy Diwali.

1134
01:21:00,902 --> 01:21:01,664
Come on.

1135
01:21:01,736 --> 01:21:03,761
Father, even I want firecrackers.

1136
01:21:03,838 --> 01:21:04,862
Yes, we will.

1137
01:21:05,039 --> 01:21:06,039
No, I want them no.

1138
01:21:06,107 --> 01:21:08,667
- Let's first get out of here.
- No, I want them now.

1139
01:21:08,743 --> 01:21:11,075
Now, father.

1140
01:21:19,153 --> 01:21:20,780
You and your Sena.

1141
01:21:21,889 --> 01:21:23,857
When you were rotting behind bars...

1142
01:21:24,892 --> 01:21:26,917
did anyone come
forward to bail you out?

1143
01:21:27,962 --> 01:21:29,521
Not a morsel to eat at home...

1144
01:21:29,797 --> 01:21:32,232
and he's always out
listening to Saheb's speeches.

1145
01:21:33,167 --> 01:21:35,932
Always yelling Hail Maharashtra.

1146
01:21:36,571 --> 01:21:38,039
Hail Maharashtra, grandma.

1147
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:39,239
Shut up!

1148
01:21:39,841 --> 01:21:41,536
Like father like son.

1149
01:21:41,976 --> 01:21:45,002
If I ever hear "Hail Maharashtra"
in this house again...

1150
01:21:45,079 --> 01:21:46,979
then you've had it.

1151
01:21:47,582 --> 01:21:50,051
- Hail Maharashtra.
- Who is that?

1152
01:21:51,753 --> 01:21:53,221
Hello, aunty.

1153
01:21:53,488 --> 01:21:54,956
Mr. Navalkar, please come in.

1154
01:21:55,022 --> 01:21:55,750
Pardon me.

1155
01:21:55,823 --> 01:21:57,018
Please sit.

1156
01:21:57,091 --> 01:21:58,024
Is Babban at home?

1157
01:21:58,092 --> 01:22:00,618
Of course.
He doesn't exactly go to work.

1158
01:22:00,828 --> 01:22:01,852
He's in the house.

1159
01:22:03,164 --> 01:22:05,792
- Navalkar sir...
- No need for this.

1160
01:22:05,933 --> 01:22:07,025
I'll make some tea.

1161
01:22:07,101 --> 01:22:07,897
Let it be.

1162
01:22:07,969 --> 01:22:08,765
And take this.

1163
01:22:08,836 --> 01:22:09,836
What is this for?

1164
01:22:09,871 --> 01:22:11,498
This is from Balasaheb.

1165
01:22:12,807 --> 01:22:14,434
- But sir...
- Keep it.

1166
01:22:15,109 --> 01:22:16,599
Money... But...

1167
01:22:16,677 --> 01:22:17,677
It's okay.

1168
01:22:17,712 --> 01:22:18,770
I'll get you some water.

1169
01:22:20,915 --> 01:22:21,915
So aunty...

1170
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:26,509
Sir, why are you giving him your money?

1171
01:22:26,587 --> 01:22:28,885
Balasaheb gave him those. Not me.

1172
01:22:28,956 --> 01:22:31,448
Can you do one thing for me?

1173
01:22:31,826 --> 01:22:34,227
Tell him to stay away from Balasaheb.

1174
01:22:35,930 --> 01:22:38,160
In fact, you should do the same.

1175
01:22:38,733 --> 01:22:40,531
Find a nice line of work.

1176
01:22:40,601 --> 01:22:42,831
These frequent trips
to jail is not a good thing.

1177
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:47,802
Aunty, did Babban get
arrested for stealing?

1178
01:22:47,875 --> 01:22:48,569
No.

1179
01:22:48,709 --> 01:22:51,735
Our agitation was to ensure
that our boys get work first.

1180
01:22:52,013 --> 01:22:54,482
Your grandson will become
a successful man some day.

1181
01:22:54,549 --> 01:22:55,549
Just wait and watch.

1182
01:22:55,583 --> 01:22:57,108
Will that really happen?

1183
01:22:57,485 --> 01:22:58,485
Of course, it will.

1184
01:22:58,619 --> 01:23:00,747
Just have faith in Balasaheb.

1185
01:23:01,022 --> 01:23:03,491
- Water.
- Let it be.

1186
01:23:03,758 --> 01:23:05,157
I'll take your leave now.

1187
01:23:11,165 --> 01:23:12,476
Come meet me at the
Branch office tomorrow.

1188
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:12,898
Yes.

1189
01:23:12,967 --> 01:23:14,128
Go see him out.

1190
01:23:14,435 --> 01:23:15,435
Yes.

1191
01:23:24,445 --> 01:23:25,879
I don't want to be anyone's God.

1192
01:23:26,214 --> 01:23:27,704
I just want to work for my people.

1193
01:23:29,217 --> 01:23:31,515
Our country got
Independence 25 years ago.

1194
01:23:32,687 --> 01:23:33,813
But the battle is still on.

1195
01:23:34,555 --> 01:23:35,750
And the reason is just one.

1196
01:23:38,893 --> 01:23:41,157
Our youngsters don't have any work.

1197
01:23:43,598 --> 01:23:44,156
We must do something.

1198
01:23:44,232 --> 01:23:46,272
If the Government doesn't do anything,
then we will.

1199
01:23:50,071 --> 01:23:52,768
Open shops on the streets.

1200
01:23:54,075 --> 01:23:58,012
Or just start a 'Vada-Pav'
(Fritter) joints.

1201
01:23:59,447 --> 01:24:01,643
This Vada-Pav will ensure
income for the youngsters...

1202
01:24:01,716 --> 01:24:04,185
as well as provide a
meal for the poor population.

1203
01:24:04,652 --> 01:24:06,484
It will become Mumbai's identity.

1204
01:24:16,697 --> 01:24:18,165
Politics is a dirty business.

1205
01:24:19,133 --> 01:24:23,434
Our organization will
only dwell 20% in Politics...

1206
01:24:24,071 --> 01:24:29,475
and the rest 80% we will deicate only
To social cause.

1207
01:24:30,111 --> 01:24:32,478
There are huge hospitals for the rich.

1208
01:24:32,547 --> 01:24:36,040
But the poor dies on
his way to the hospital.

1209
01:24:36,984 --> 01:24:38,782
Start free ambulance service.

1210
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:43,586
We'll set an example for all
the Political par-ties in the country.

1211
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:48,793
Don't just yell and scream
that there are no jobs.

1212
01:24:52,833 --> 01:24:56,929
If we want to take those jobs, then
we'll need talented candidates for it.

1213
01:24:58,005 --> 01:24:59,029
Hone their skills.

1214
01:24:59,807 --> 01:25:02,902
Only then will our struggle
bear fruit in the future.

1215
01:25:08,516 --> 01:25:11,213
Prepare our boys for
the competitive exams.

1216
01:25:11,752 --> 01:25:15,689
And give them technical education.

1217
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:22,488
The owners will survive when
the companies function smoothly.

1218
01:25:22,863 --> 01:25:25,161
And when the owners survive,
so will the workers.

1219
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,962
If workers survive,
the country will thrive.

1220
01:25:30,738 --> 01:25:33,639
A strike will just be a clog in
the wheel and do more harm to workers.

1221
01:25:42,984 --> 01:25:45,715
Start a union in all
the big companies here.

1222
01:25:55,963 --> 01:25:58,796
The other parties have forced
our youngsters to the street.

1223
01:25:59,233 --> 01:26:00,962
Ruined their lives.

1224
01:26:01,802 --> 01:26:06,603
But our party will lend them a hand in
support and give them a new lease on life.

1225
01:26:07,842 --> 01:26:10,539
If our boys don't get jobs,
at the right time...

1226
01:26:15,249 --> 01:26:18,219
then soon it is sure that 'anarchy'
Will spread throughout our country.

1227
01:26:18,486 --> 01:26:23,720
Ladies and Gentlemen, For the security
of our country...

1228
01:26:24,091 --> 01:26:28,688
the President has declared
an Emergency in the country.

1229
01:26:29,797 --> 01:26:34,826
There is no need to panic.

1230
01:26:36,771 --> 01:26:38,603
In Exercise of the powers,

1231
01:26:38,673 --> 01:26:40,835
confirmed by Clause 1 of Article.

1232
01:26:40,908 --> 01:26:41,932
Hello, Gurwinder.

1233
01:26:42,009 --> 01:26:44,842
Tell your men to burn all our posters.

1234
01:26:44,912 --> 01:26:47,574
352 of the Constitution...

1235
01:26:47,648 --> 01:26:51,141
Inform all the party workers
to reach Nagpur.

1236
01:26:51,218 --> 01:26:52,151
Hail Almighty.

1237
01:26:52,219 --> 01:26:55,052
I, Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, the
President of India.

1238
01:26:55,122 --> 01:26:57,557
By the procl amation declared.

1239
01:27:01,595 --> 01:27:04,189
That a great emergency exists whereby.

1240
01:27:04,465 --> 01:27:07,594
Security of India is threatened
by internal disturbance.

1241
01:27:07,668 --> 01:27:09,693
Listen, Malda office is raided.

1242
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:10,896
Police have raided.

1243
01:27:10,971 --> 01:27:13,838
Hide all the important
documents you have.

1244
01:27:15,576 --> 01:27:16,634
What is this, Balasaheb?

1245
01:27:16,711 --> 01:27:18,151
You're getting your teeth cleaned...

1246
01:27:18,212 --> 01:27:22,547
whereas that Rajni is preparing
to wipe out your Organisation.

1247
01:27:23,217 --> 01:27:25,481
One can't clean with dirty hands.

1248
01:27:25,553 --> 01:27:27,612
What kind of an Emergency' is this?

1249
01:27:28,255 --> 01:27:32,522
Mr. Desai, this is clearly
a conspiracy to suppress our voice.

1250
01:27:32,593 --> 01:27:33,593
<i>Mr. Outta...</i>

1251
01:27:34,562 --> 01:27:36,963
Only Dr. Shroff can shut my mouth.

1252
01:27:38,966 --> 01:27:41,162
I am the man who sticks
his hand in the tiger's mouth.

1253
01:27:41,235 --> 01:27:43,169
But even I can't suppress his voice.

1254
01:27:43,237 --> 01:27:44,864
Otherwise, my clinic will close down.

1255
01:27:51,512 --> 01:27:54,140
Balasaheb, don't take it lightly.

1256
01:27:55,116 --> 01:27:57,050
This is their final warning.

1257
01:27:57,785 --> 01:28:00,220
Shiv Sena must merge with Congress.

1258
01:28:01,188 --> 01:28:03,919
And the formalities
have already been completed.

1259
01:28:04,859 --> 01:28:08,124
Someone from Rajni's office will
come to you with all the documents.

1260
01:28:10,064 --> 01:28:15,161
If you don't sign,
then they will ban Shiv Sena.

1261
01:28:18,038 --> 01:28:24,944
All the related documents have
already reached Indiraji at South Block.

1262
01:28:39,827 --> 01:28:42,922
Tell Rajni I won't
sign on the merger papers.

1263
01:28:46,133 --> 01:28:53,733
The day they put a ban on my
organization, that day will be his last.

1264
01:28:59,013 --> 01:29:02,711
Hello. This is All
India Radio, Mumbai.

1265
01:29:02,983 --> 01:29:05,577
And now for News in Hindi.

1266
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:12,590
Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi will
arrive at Bombay Airport at 10:20 am.

1267
01:29:13,027 --> 01:29:16,725
At 11:00 am in Tilak Bhavan Garden...

1268
01:29:16,797 --> 01:29:18,317
Sister-in-law,
why did you turn it off?

1269
01:29:18,599 --> 01:29:19,599
What's wrong?

1270
01:29:21,735 --> 01:29:23,965
Does Indiraji read Marmik as well?

1271
01:29:25,039 --> 01:29:26,039
Why?

1272
01:29:27,141 --> 01:29:32,204
I mean... he's made a lot
of caricatures about her.

1273
01:29:35,115 --> 01:29:37,948
By the way, why do you
think Indiraji wants to meet him?

1274
01:29:38,986 --> 01:29:42,012
Maybe she's never seen a real
tiger before and wants to see one.

1275
01:29:42,556 --> 01:29:45,548
Oh, God. You're his brother after all.

1276
01:29:51,732 --> 01:29:54,827
Will our organization close down?

1277
01:30:18,926 --> 01:30:19,926
Hello.

1278
01:30:19,994 --> 01:30:21,860
It wasn't easy to
recognize Bal Thackeray.

1279
01:30:21,929 --> 01:30:23,021
Hello, sir.

1280
01:30:23,097 --> 01:30:24,792
Hello, sir. Hail Maharashtra, Mr Desai.

1281
01:30:25,099 --> 01:30:26,692
- CM sir.
- Hello, Bala Saheb.

1282
01:30:26,767 --> 01:30:27,165
How are you'?

1283
01:30:27,234 --> 01:30:28,463
- Good.
- All good?

1284
01:30:28,535 --> 01:30:29,535
Yes.

1285
01:30:30,838 --> 01:30:31,838
Just a minute.

1286
01:30:32,806 --> 01:30:33,806
Hello, Bala Saheb.

1287
01:30:46,754 --> 01:30:48,688
I had a word with Vasant Rao.

1288
01:30:49,123 --> 01:30:51,114
And Vasant Rao, with madam.

1289
01:30:51,892 --> 01:30:53,587
You arrived at the right time.

1290
01:30:53,994 --> 01:30:55,894
Otherwise,
the Committee meeting would've begun.

1291
01:30:56,730 --> 01:31:00,132
Madam has reserved complete 5
minutes for you.

1292
01:31:02,102 --> 01:31:03,866
Bala Saheb, Rajni Patel.

1293
01:31:06,707 --> 01:31:07,799
Hello, Mr. Desai.

1294
01:31:11,645 --> 01:31:14,979
Be seated.
It will take a couple of more hours.

1295
01:31:15,049 --> 01:31:17,177
Mr. Thackeray,
madam has called you inside.

1296
01:31:22,656 --> 01:31:24,021
Don't be angry.

1297
01:31:24,491 --> 01:31:29,986
I've heard that you preach that
Maharashtra is only for Maharashtrians.

1298
01:31:30,898 --> 01:31:33,629
I believe in the unity
and diversity of this country.

1299
01:31:34,101 --> 01:31:37,503
Then why do people fear you?

1300
01:31:37,571 --> 01:31:39,903
It's just propaganda by the media.

1301
01:31:40,674 --> 01:31:43,837
I, only talk about the
right and honor of my people.

1302
01:31:43,911 --> 01:31:46,937
Right? What right
are you talking about?

1303
01:31:47,781 --> 01:31:50,079
I didn't create different
states and language.

1304
01:31:50,884 --> 01:31:52,045
The Constitution did.

1305
01:31:53,821 --> 01:31:55,880
And if that is the
foundation of this state...

1306
01:31:56,790 --> 01:31:59,418
then our people have
the right to live respectfully.

1307
01:31:59,493 --> 01:32:01,154
But... that never happened.

1308
01:32:02,896 --> 01:32:03,761
Then I...

1309
01:32:03,831 --> 01:32:04,831
Madam.

1310
01:32:04,999 --> 01:32:09,436
Don't send anyone in
until this meeting isn't over.

1311
01:32:09,770 --> 01:32:10,770
Yes, madam.

1312
01:32:11,071 --> 01:32:12,505
So you were saying...

1313
01:32:12,573 --> 01:32:15,508
I never made any speeches
against the nation.

1314
01:32:16,143 --> 01:32:20,046
If you find any of my speech,
writing, or cartoons...

1315
01:32:20,114 --> 01:32:22,514
me promoting that Maharashtra
is only for Maharashtrian...

1316
01:32:22,549 --> 01:32:24,589
then I will personally
close down my Organisation.

1317
01:32:24,918 --> 01:32:27,238
Those who have been living
for many years in Maharashtra...

1318
01:32:27,688 --> 01:32:29,019
are Maharashtrians for me.

1319
01:32:29,490 --> 01:32:31,219
Like those living
in Punjab are Punjabis.

1320
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:33,524
And Bengalis in Bengal.

1321
01:32:33,961 --> 01:32:35,929
If that is his place of birth,

1322
01:32:36,163 --> 01:32:40,066
then he should get first preference
to a job or education in his state.

1323
01:32:40,134 --> 01:32:41,134
That's all.

1324
01:32:41,835 --> 01:32:44,668
Whenever I say Jai Hind,
Jai Maharashtra.

1325
01:32:45,806 --> 01:32:47,501
I always say Jai Hind first.

1326
01:32:47,941 --> 01:32:48,941
And then Jai Maharashtra.

1327
01:32:49,109 --> 01:32:52,511
Because my country is my
first priority, and then my state.

1328
01:32:52,579 --> 01:32:53,842
- Wait here.
- Okay.

1329
01:32:54,248 --> 01:32:55,647
Just a little later.

1330
01:33:07,428 --> 01:33:11,023
What do you think about the Emergency?

1331
01:33:12,433 --> 01:33:17,030
If Emergency brings discipline in the
country, then I am not against it at all.

1332
01:33:19,873 --> 01:33:24,470
My people were completely
misinformed about you.

1333
01:33:25,145 --> 01:33:27,113
That's why we also had
some misunderstandings too.

1334
01:33:28,115 --> 01:33:34,714
Well, anyway... do think
about my proposal.

1335
01:33:36,023 --> 01:33:38,492
My state, my people. They need me.

1336
01:33:39,827 --> 01:33:41,158
But still, I thank you.

1337
01:33:45,566 --> 01:33:46,124
Jai Hind.

1338
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:48,161
Jai Hind. Jai Maharashtra.

1339
01:33:53,707 --> 01:33:54,707
Yes, madam.

1340
01:33:55,075 --> 01:33:56,804
Bring that file from Mr. Rajni.

1341
01:33:56,877 --> 01:33:57,877
Yes, here you go.

1342
01:34:08,956 --> 01:34:14,793
Out of all the organizations we've banned,
I am removing Shiv Sena from the list.

1343
01:34:15,028 --> 01:34:16,894
Prepare a new list.

1344
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:36,848
- Long Live...
- Shiv Sena!

1345
01:34:36,917 --> 01:34:40,547
- Long Live...
- Shiv Sena!

1346
01:34:51,198 --> 01:34:55,226
Everyone will get it.
Everyone will get one.

1347
01:34:55,502 --> 01:34:57,561
Here you go.

1348
01:34:59,006 --> 01:35:02,670
- Long Live...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray.

1349
01:35:02,743 --> 01:35:06,509
- Long Live...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray.

1350
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:12,610
Today is rightfully a
new beginning for our people.

1351
01:35:13,921 --> 01:35:20,657
People from every caste and creed will
always be welcome in this structure.

1352
01:35:24,865 --> 01:35:28,733
I'll be always here for your help.

1353
01:35:30,571 --> 01:35:37,637
Which reminds of a few lines
by our National Poet Ramdhari Singh.

1354
01:35:40,881 --> 01:35:45,011
"Raging storms and
cyclones as well..."

1355
01:35:45,552 --> 01:35:49,511
"when the people are
enraged and raise an eyebrow."

1356
01:35:50,224 --> 01:35:53,250
"The paths led by
the chariot of time..."

1357
01:35:53,794 --> 01:35:55,489
"hear the sound."

1358
01:35:55,562 --> 01:35:58,725
"Vacate the throne,
because the people are coming."

1359
01:35:58,799 --> 01:36:01,928
"Vacate the throne,
because the people are coming."

1360
01:36:02,002 --> 01:36:03,766
This is a revolution, my friends.

1361
01:36:03,837 --> 01:36:05,703
A complete revolution.

1362
01:36:23,724 --> 01:36:27,922
Balasaheb, Janta Party won with majority
votes only because of the Emergency.

1363
01:36:27,995 --> 01:36:28,894
But the Congress...

1364
01:36:28,962 --> 01:36:30,896
Congress Party will
never cease to exist.

1365
01:36:32,132 --> 01:36:34,260
It's easy to stay in the
opposition and give speeches.

1366
01:36:35,102 --> 01:36:36,570
But coming in power...

1367
01:36:37,004 --> 01:36:38,204
Enough, sister-in-law. Enough.

1368
01:36:38,272 --> 01:36:39,916
- This is Mumbai's mutton...
- Have some more.

1369
01:36:39,940 --> 01:36:40,964
And not from Baramati.

1370
01:36:43,744 --> 01:36:44,744
Some more...

1371
01:36:45,145 --> 01:36:49,082
But coming to power and running the government
And the country is a different ball game.

1372
01:36:49,950 --> 01:36:51,194
- Get some water.
- Witing 5 years the people...

1373
01:36:51,218 --> 01:36:53,710
will start saying
that Congress was better.

1374
01:36:56,657 --> 01:36:58,819
Balasaheb,
we should do something together.

1375
01:37:00,494 --> 01:37:03,225
Shared, we failed in
everything we did together.

1376
01:37:04,765 --> 01:37:06,460
We started a weekly magazine,
which failed.

1377
01:37:06,533 --> 01:37:08,173
I never got to publish
the second edition.

1378
01:37:08,635 --> 01:37:11,866
I think we're better off as friends,
and not partnership.

1379
01:37:11,938 --> 01:37:13,804
That's how you befriended Vasant Rao.

1380
01:37:13,874 --> 01:37:14,874
No, no, not at all.

1381
01:37:16,243 --> 01:37:22,512
We don't pull each other's legs,
and only share a cigar.

1382
01:37:22,582 --> 01:37:24,107
That's why we are friends.

1383
01:37:25,118 --> 01:37:26,745
You must take rice.

1384
01:37:27,688 --> 01:37:29,679
Enough, sister-in-law. I am full.

1385
01:37:30,057 --> 01:37:31,616
Serve some more to the Minister.

1386
01:37:32,059 --> 01:37:34,050
Need to cook a political mix daily now!

1387
01:37:39,032 --> 01:37:42,263
I've always dreamed
of some Maharashtrian leader...

1388
01:37:43,870 --> 01:37:45,830
of someday becoming
the leader of this country.

1389
01:37:48,108 --> 01:37:55,037
But the problem with our people is that
they don't think beyond Maharashtra.

1390
01:37:55,549 --> 01:37:57,677
Balasaheb, Maharashtrian leaders...

1391
01:37:57,751 --> 01:37:58,479
Come, sit.

1392
01:37:58,652 --> 01:37:59,141
No.

1393
01:37:59,219 --> 01:38:00,778
Come Maa, sit down.

1394
01:38:01,621 --> 01:38:04,147
There's another interesting
fact about Maharashtrian leaders.

1395
01:38:05,025 --> 01:38:07,084
They sit on each other's
seats to go to Delhi.

1396
01:38:07,761 --> 01:38:08,761
Why?

1397
01:38:08,929 --> 01:38:10,897
To acquire each other's seat.

1398
01:38:14,167 --> 01:38:17,535
Mr. Sharad, you think
about politics 24/7.

1399
01:38:18,872 --> 01:38:21,603
- Do you watch dramas or films?
- Sometimes.

1400
01:38:23,243 --> 01:38:25,003
Did you watch the cricket
match two days ago?

1401
01:38:25,545 --> 01:38:27,673
I am not too keen about
watching cricket, Bala Saheb.

1402
01:38:27,748 --> 01:38:29,807
But he is very interested in cricket.

1403
01:38:30,183 --> 01:38:32,618
If there's a match in progress,
and he has the time...

1404
01:38:32,753 --> 01:38:35,245
then he will sit with
the transistor's For the entire day.

1405
01:38:36,223 --> 01:38:37,713
He must be interested as well.

1406
01:38:39,226 --> 01:38:41,266
When Sharad says he's
not interested in something...

1407
01:38:42,229 --> 01:38:43,890
that means he's very interested.

1408
01:38:43,964 --> 01:38:46,797
Like he's interested in me.

1409
01:38:49,169 --> 01:38:50,169
It's 5 o'clock.

1410
01:38:50,604 --> 01:38:51,604
Let's hear the radio.

1411
01:38:52,072 --> 01:38:54,200
Let's hear what Morarji
has to say in today's meeting.

1412
01:38:54,941 --> 01:38:58,969
For the first time the
population of this country...

1413
01:38:59,446 --> 01:39:07,446
have quit being slaves of the
Congress and built their own government.

1414
01:39:09,456 --> 01:39:13,552
- Long Live...
- Morarji sir...

1415
01:39:13,693 --> 01:39:18,927
When the entire country
was against Emergency...

1416
01:39:18,999 --> 01:39:26,463
a few of the local parties
were supported the Emergency.

1417
01:39:27,474 --> 01:39:35,474
The time has come when we drag these
parties out of this country forever.

1418
01:39:35,749 --> 01:39:37,239
Isn't this the Shiv Sena Bhavan?

1419
01:39:37,517 --> 01:39:40,009
Yes, they are the ones
who supported Emergency.

1420
01:39:40,086 --> 01:39:41,247
Bloody traitors.

1421
01:39:41,521 --> 01:39:42,665
Who are you calling traitors?

1422
01:39:42,689 --> 01:39:44,680
You are traitors.

1423
01:39:44,758 --> 01:39:45,919
Come down...

1424
01:39:46,193 --> 01:39:48,525
Wait. Stop.

1425
01:39:49,196 --> 01:39:50,721
Stop.

1426
01:39:52,265 --> 01:39:54,063
Stop.

1427
01:40:30,136 --> 01:40:33,231
"I am not scared of
such baseless attacks."

1428
01:40:34,741 --> 01:40:36,675
"My father gave me a mantra."

1429
01:40:37,143 --> 01:40:39,043
("Get up C) Maratha, wake up now."

1430
01:40:41,147 --> 01:40:43,514
"Normally a Maratha
doesn't get up easily."

1431
01:40:43,850 --> 01:40:46,979
"But once he does,
he never steps back."

1432
01:40:49,523 --> 01:40:52,754
"Even if we lose a few bonds,
the house won't come crashing down."

1433
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:57,026
"My intentions,
my thoughts, won't end so easily."

1434
01:41:02,869 --> 01:41:06,100
"The war is far from over,
this is just the beginning."

1435
01:41:06,773 --> 01:41:11,210
"And, it won't end until every Maharashtrian
gets the respect he deserves."

1436
01:41:14,881 --> 01:41:17,851
"I am not scared of the encroaching
darkness of today's setting sun."

1437
01:41:18,919 --> 01:41:22,822
"Tomorrow the dawn will
paint the horizon red again."

1438
01:41:26,493 --> 01:41:28,689
Saheb, Mayor Gupte is here to see you.

1439
01:41:28,828 --> 01:41:29,828
Shall I send him in?

1440
01:41:30,697 --> 01:41:31,697
Send him in.

1441
01:41:33,033 --> 01:41:34,057
Jai Maharashtra, Saheb.

1442
01:41:44,110 --> 01:41:45,771
Speak up, Mayor.

1443
01:41:46,046 --> 01:41:47,046
Sir that...

1444
01:41:47,747 --> 01:41:49,511
I said speak freely. Speak.

1445
01:42:03,730 --> 01:42:05,562
The populace has clearly decided...

1446
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:09,695
<i>The country and even the
state have chosen the 'Santa Party.</i>

1447
01:42:10,003 --> 01:42:10,697
And so?

1448
01:42:10,770 --> 01:42:13,762
Well, Shiv Sena's time is over.

1449
01:42:15,942 --> 01:42:19,071
I mean... it can't be forgotten
that we did fight our battle.

1450
01:42:19,946 --> 01:42:22,546
But in this election, people
have distanced themselves from you...

1451
01:42:23,917 --> 01:42:25,783
I mean from us.

1452
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:29,849
And so, a lot of us believe...

1453
01:42:30,624 --> 01:42:33,144
that if we think about
it from the political point of view...

1454
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:36,552
then we should merge
with the Janta Party.

1455
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:37,630
Hey...

1456
01:42:38,999 --> 01:42:39,999
Wait.

1457
01:42:40,934 --> 01:42:44,700
And anyway, the number
of violent people are increasing.

1458
01:42:45,005 --> 01:42:49,238
And how can anyone expect
any political sense from them'?

1459
01:42:58,652 --> 01:43:01,986
My organization was always for such
fearless people, and always will be.

1460
01:43:04,457 --> 01:43:06,537
Doctors like you who sell
colored water in bottles...

1461
01:43:06,993 --> 01:43:10,520
are mayor of this city because of them.

1462
01:43:10,597 --> 01:43:11,086
Sir...

1463
01:43:11,164 --> 01:43:12,689
And don't you forget that.

1464
01:43:14,601 --> 01:43:15,727
You're a doctor.

1465
01:43:18,772 --> 01:43:20,536
Even you have knives.

1466
01:43:22,042 --> 01:43:24,534
But you use to earn
a living for yourself...

1467
01:43:24,611 --> 01:43:26,931
and they use it to ensure
that others get a square meal.

1468
01:43:26,980 --> 01:43:28,004
There is a difference.

1469
01:43:30,850 --> 01:43:31,850
And one more thing.

1470
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:37,788
Those who want to quit
Shiv Sena can happily do so.

1471
01:43:39,192 --> 01:43:40,660
Even I'm left alone...

1472
01:43:41,461 --> 01:43:45,227
I'm still blessed with enough strength
to bring thousands of people together.

1473
01:43:47,233 --> 01:43:48,564
Sir...

1474
01:43:50,570 --> 01:43:52,664
And these violent
people you object about...

1475
01:43:53,540 --> 01:43:56,620
I will take this organization to new
heights with the help of these people.

1476
01:43:57,010 --> 01:43:59,672
Ya Hussein!

1477
01:43:59,746 --> 01:44:02,113
Ya Hussein!

1478
01:44:02,182 --> 01:44:04,776
Ya Hussein!

1479
01:44:04,851 --> 01:44:07,445
Ya Hussein!

1480
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:09,784
Ya Hussein!

1481
01:44:09,989 --> 01:44:12,583
Ya Hussein!

1482
01:44:12,659 --> 01:44:15,026
Ya Hussein!

1483
01:44:15,095 --> 01:44:17,427
Ya Hussein!

1484
01:44:19,866 --> 01:44:21,766
What is your problem
in saying Jai Maharashtra?

1485
01:44:22,936 --> 01:44:25,200
Let's forget about caste
and creed and do something good.

1486
01:44:26,573 --> 01:44:28,598
I am not against any
religion or community.

1487
01:44:29,542 --> 01:44:31,738
I believe in a man's deeds,
and not his religion.

1488
01:44:35,915 --> 01:44:36,973
But what is this?

1489
01:44:37,884 --> 01:44:43,550
Whenever India loses a match, some people
distribute sweets and burst crackers.

1490
01:44:44,124 --> 01:44:45,649
They celebrate.

1491
01:44:45,959 --> 01:44:47,688
Put a stop this.

1492
01:44:48,228 --> 01:44:49,992
If we stay together...

1493
01:44:50,463 --> 01:44:52,174
then those who pit us against
each other in the name of religion...

1494
01:44:52,198 --> 01:44:53,859
will soon have to quit this country.

1495
01:44:57,837 --> 01:45:00,932
Go ahead and celebrate Eid,
and we'll join you with enthusiasm.

1496
01:45:01,207 --> 01:45:06,202
But you must also celebrate Shiv Jayanti
with the same enthusiasm and joy.

1497
01:45:09,048 --> 01:45:12,848
- Jai Bhavani.
- Jai Shivaji.

1498
01:45:12,919 --> 01:45:15,183
- Jai Bhavani.
- Jai Shivaji.

1499
01:45:15,255 --> 01:45:17,053
- Jai Bhavani.
- Jai Shivaji.

1500
01:45:17,123 --> 01:45:20,616
- Jai Bhawani...
- Jai Shivaji!

1501
01:45:20,693 --> 01:45:24,891
- Jai Bhawani...
- Jai Shivaji!

1502
01:45:40,780 --> 01:45:42,714
Upstairs. Let's go upstairs.

1503
01:45:45,051 --> 01:45:46,610
You...

1504
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:49,712
Kill him. Kill him.

1505
01:45:55,795 --> 01:46:00,198
Whenever we tried to embrace them,
they tried to stab us in the back.

1506
01:46:02,635 --> 01:46:03,727
They are beyond help.

1507
01:46:06,606 --> 01:46:07,903
No more Muslim Leagues.

1508
01:46:09,976 --> 01:46:14,937
If the Muslims of this country want to
vote on the basis of religion, then...

1509
01:46:16,182 --> 01:46:19,015
We'll stay steadfast
on our ideology of Hindu religion.

1510
01:46:25,225 --> 01:46:27,193
Don't live like an <i>as****</i>

1511
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:28,819
Even dying is better.

1512
01:46:29,796 --> 01:46:31,560
Such helplessness for votes.

1513
01:46:34,701 --> 01:46:37,033
They think about Muslims
when they need votes.

1514
01:46:38,938 --> 01:46:43,899
From now on, those who talk about
Hindus will get to rule in India.

1515
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:48,580
I...

1516
01:46:49,115 --> 01:46:50,708
I said to Pramod Mahajan.

1517
01:46:53,052 --> 01:46:57,114
If a Maharashtrian can
cast his vote in Maharashtra...

1518
01:46:57,190 --> 01:46:59,852
then why can't Hindus do the same.

1519
01:47:01,194 --> 01:47:05,893
But today,
by making Ramesh Prabhu win...

1520
01:47:07,066 --> 01:47:09,347
you've shown the power
of Hindus to the entire country.

1521
01:47:13,072 --> 01:47:15,632
Even the court cannot stop
us from promoting the Hindu ideology.

1522
01:47:15,708 --> 01:47:17,608
No matter what the
decision of the court...

1523
01:47:17,911 --> 01:47:21,074
Shiv Sena will contest the elections
on the basis of Hindu ideology.

1524
01:47:23,783 --> 01:47:25,808
- Say it with pride...
- We're Hindus.

1525
01:47:25,885 --> 01:47:27,819
- Say it with pride...
- We're Hindus.

1526
01:47:27,887 --> 01:47:29,981
- Say it with pride...
- We're Hindus.

1527
01:47:30,056 --> 01:47:32,081
You provoked the
people with your speech.

1528
01:47:32,825 --> 01:47:35,851
And on your orders, your
people demolished the Babri Mosque.

1529
01:47:36,529 --> 01:47:39,021
Mosque? Which Mosque?

1530
01:47:41,267 --> 01:47:42,667
There was a Ram Temple, over there.

1531
01:47:43,803 --> 01:47:45,134
Lord Sri Ram's birthplace.

1532
01:47:47,674 --> 01:47:51,201
How do you know that
Lord Ram was born there'?

1533
01:47:51,878 --> 01:47:53,505
Was he born in Pakistan instead?

1534
01:47:55,848 --> 01:47:56,928
Maybe in Karachi or Lahore.

1535
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:01,520
Silence, please.

1536
01:48:02,155 --> 01:48:04,749
There were no birth
certificates back in those days...

1537
01:48:04,824 --> 01:48:06,451
which I could show you saying,

1538
01:48:06,526 --> 01:48:11,464
"Sir, this is the date of birth,
Sir, this is the place of birth".

1539
01:48:11,965 --> 01:48:13,865
The people of India told me.

1540
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:15,500
Their faith told me.

1541
01:48:15,568 --> 01:48:18,162
They believe that Lord
Ram was born in that place.

1542
01:48:20,673 --> 01:48:23,165
Mr. Lawyer, can you answer a question?

1543
01:48:24,077 --> 01:48:25,077
What?

1544
01:48:25,578 --> 01:48:27,637
Do you know where Babur was born?

1545
01:48:30,783 --> 01:48:31,249
I don't know.

1546
01:48:31,517 --> 01:48:32,985
You don't, do you? I knew it.

1547
01:48:33,486 --> 01:48:34,486
Let me tell you.

1548
01:48:36,155 --> 01:48:38,647
Babur was born in what
is known as Uzbekistan now.

1549
01:48:39,692 --> 01:48:42,684
So is Uzbekistan in Ayodhya?

1550
01:48:45,565 --> 01:48:47,499
Look, I don't want to get into this.

1551
01:48:48,201 --> 01:48:51,136
But a few people's emotions
were attached to the structure...

1552
01:48:51,204 --> 01:48:52,831
which your people demolished.

1553
01:48:52,905 --> 01:48:54,498
No, we didn't demolish it.

1554
01:48:55,475 --> 01:48:56,874
We simply cleared it.

1555
01:48:57,076 --> 01:48:59,135
Hail Shri Ram!

1556
01:48:59,212 --> 01:49:01,544
Hail Shri Ram!

1557
01:49:01,614 --> 01:49:03,605
Hail Shri Ram!

1558
01:49:03,683 --> 01:49:05,811
Hail Shri Ram!

1559
01:49:05,885 --> 01:49:07,944
Hail Shri Ram!

1560
01:49:08,021 --> 01:49:10,080
Hail Shri Ram!

1561
01:49:10,189 --> 01:49:12,487
Hail Shri Ram!

1562
01:49:12,558 --> 01:49:14,583
Hail Shri Ram!

1563
01:49:14,694 --> 01:49:16,719
Hail Shri Ram!

1564
01:49:16,796 --> 01:49:19,094
Hail Shri Ram!

1565
01:49:20,133 --> 01:49:23,569
You mean you didn't do anything
wrong by demolishing the structure.

1566
01:49:24,604 --> 01:49:26,231
I wasn't even present there.

1567
01:49:27,874 --> 01:49:30,900
And the accusations you are levelling,
are against my people.

1568
01:49:31,544 --> 01:49:34,912
How is it possible that I will
stay quiet while you accuse my people'?

1569
01:49:35,581 --> 01:49:40,246
I live for my people.
I can't even leave them.

1570
01:49:40,753 --> 01:49:43,654
We were not involved
in whatever went down there.

1571
01:49:43,856 --> 01:49:48,259
In fact, we broke what was
an onslaught by a cruel power.

1572
01:49:49,762 --> 01:49:52,754
We only corrected,
what they had wronged.

1573
01:49:53,166 --> 01:49:56,625
Hail Shri Ram!

1574
01:49:56,702 --> 01:49:57,702
Order!

1575
01:49:57,870 --> 01:49:58,870
Order!

1576
01:50:01,207 --> 01:50:07,442
Hail Almighty!

1577
01:51:18,985 --> 01:51:20,612
- Throw that aside.
- Yes, sir.

1578
01:51:21,053 --> 01:51:23,647
Check on that side. Check.

1579
01:51:24,690 --> 01:51:25,987
You check on the right.

1580
01:51:31,063 --> 01:51:32,383
Bhalerao, you check on that side.

1581
01:51:32,498 --> 01:51:33,590
Yes sir.

1582
01:51:37,837 --> 01:51:39,828
- Anybody there?
- Checking, sir.

1583
01:51:55,721 --> 01:51:57,587
Shinde, anybody there?

1584
01:51:59,458 --> 01:52:00,458
No one, sir.

1585
01:52:03,529 --> 01:52:04,826
Okay, okay, let's go.

1586
01:52:19,011 --> 01:52:23,539
"Better than the entire world.."

1587
01:52:23,883 --> 01:52:28,184
"is our India."

1588
01:52:28,721 --> 01:52:32,783
"We are its nightingales."

1589
01:52:33,526 --> 01:52:37,121
"And this is our garden."

1590
01:52:38,864 --> 01:52:39,626
Mother...

1591
01:52:39,699 --> 01:52:40,894
Amina, stay back.

1592
01:52:40,967 --> 01:52:42,230
Stay back.

1593
01:52:42,501 --> 01:52:44,162
We've been waiting since morning, sir.

1594
01:52:44,237 --> 01:52:46,831
Just two minutes, sir.

1595
01:52:47,039 --> 01:52:48,131
Sir...

1596
01:52:48,207 --> 01:52:52,166
Stay back. Let the car pass.

1597
01:52:52,245 --> 01:52:53,542
Sir...

1598
01:52:53,646 --> 01:52:54,646
Yes, sir.

1599
01:52:58,017 --> 01:53:00,418
I've been waiting here for three hours.

1600
01:53:00,486 --> 01:53:02,045
Just give me a few minutes.

1601
01:53:03,522 --> 01:53:04,522
Send them in.

1602
01:53:06,492 --> 01:53:07,492
Where do you stay?

1603
01:53:08,594 --> 01:53:10,062
Behram pada, sir.

1604
01:53:10,496 --> 01:53:11,554
My name is Amina.

1605
01:53:11,931 --> 01:53:14,491
He's my husband, Taahir.

1606
01:53:14,967 --> 01:53:17,902
And these are my children.

1607
01:53:18,771 --> 01:53:20,136
They burnt down our house.

1608
01:53:21,073 --> 01:53:22,700
And we've nowhere to go.

1609
01:53:23,843 --> 01:53:27,939
Please save us... Only
you can save us now.

1610
01:53:28,848 --> 01:53:30,907
Why do you keep looking at the watch?

1611
01:53:31,784 --> 01:53:33,718
Sir, it's time for... Prayers (Namaaz)

1612
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:38,889
It's time for my prayers ( Namaaz).

1613
01:53:42,628 --> 01:53:44,187
- You can pray here.
- No, sir.

1614
01:53:44,463 --> 01:53:46,158
I have no enmity against your religion.

1615
01:53:47,833 --> 01:53:49,873
My enmity is against those
infidels who resort to...

1616
01:53:49,902 --> 01:53:51,631
unrighteousness
in the name of religion.

1617
01:53:51,704 --> 01:53:52,848
Do you have a mat for praying?

1618
01:53:52,872 --> 01:53:54,465
No, sir. We've nothing left.

1619
01:53:54,507 --> 01:53:55,736
Everything was burned down.

1620
01:53:58,811 --> 01:54:00,506
- Ravi.
- Yes, sir.

1621
01:54:01,681 --> 01:54:03,547
- Give them a mat.
- Yes.

1622
01:54:18,130 --> 01:54:21,464
- What's your name, dear?
- My name is Asiya.

1623
01:54:39,151 --> 01:54:42,086
And not just the demolition
of the mosque, but even in Bombay...

1624
01:54:42,154 --> 01:54:43,451
That's Mumbai.

1625
01:54:44,023 --> 01:54:45,650
<i>Yes, Bombay.</i>

1626
01:54:45,725 --> 01:54:46,725
Mumbai!

1627
01:54:48,094 --> 01:54:50,586
You had a hand in the
riots that broke out in Mumbai, too.

1628
01:54:54,033 --> 01:54:55,057
No, I had a foot.

1629
01:54:58,104 --> 01:54:59,104
What?

1630
01:55:00,740 --> 01:55:05,075
I personally went to
every riot-affected area.

1631
01:55:07,613 --> 01:55:11,641
Even after committing numerous murders,
people were freely roaming the streets.

1632
01:55:12,118 --> 01:55:14,763
At such a time, there was a strong
need to bring them under control.

1633
01:55:14,787 --> 01:55:16,064
But that's a job for the Police.

1634
01:55:16,088 --> 01:55:16,611
Exactly.

1635
01:55:16,689 --> 01:55:17,769
It is a job for the Police.

1636
01:55:19,024 --> 01:55:20,584
But the Police are government servants.

1637
01:55:20,659 --> 01:55:23,179
They can't take action until they
don't get orders from the top.

1638
01:55:25,197 --> 01:55:28,565
And the people on the top simply sit in
their air-conditioned office doing nothing.

1639
01:55:28,634 --> 01:55:31,035
Because their politics
thrive on such riots.

1640
01:55:33,272 --> 01:55:35,900
If the Police are given
a free hand to do their job...

1641
01:55:35,975 --> 01:55:39,138
it will take them less
than half an hour to stop these riots.

1642
01:55:44,283 --> 01:55:47,150
Even you play such
politics based on riots.

1643
01:55:47,219 --> 01:55:50,746
No, I don't need to play politics.

1644
01:55:51,557 --> 01:55:55,790
But when my country is concerned,
I don't play political games.

1645
01:55:57,530 --> 01:55:59,521
You even do politics in games.

1646
01:56:00,766 --> 01:56:02,757
Sir. Sir,
please tell us what you talked about?

1647
01:56:02,835 --> 01:56:04,667
Sir, please tell us...

1648
01:56:04,737 --> 01:56:05,863
Sir, please...

1649
01:56:05,938 --> 01:56:07,235
Tell us, sir.

1650
01:56:07,506 --> 01:56:08,735
Move. Move.

1651
01:56:08,808 --> 01:56:10,469
Sir...

1652
01:56:10,543 --> 01:56:13,911
We want to know, please...

1653
01:56:19,685 --> 01:56:20,685
Who?

1654
01:56:20,753 --> 01:56:23,484
Please inform that Dilip Vengsarkar
and Javed Miandad have come.

1655
01:56:23,556 --> 01:56:24,148
Hello.

1656
01:56:24,523 --> 01:56:25,683
We have taken an appointment.

1657
01:56:27,126 --> 01:56:28,126
Okay.

1658
01:56:30,863 --> 01:56:33,491
Dilip Vengsarkar and
Javed Miandad are here?

1659
01:56:33,632 --> 01:56:34,632
Who?

1660
01:56:34,867 --> 01:56:37,131
Dilip Vengsarkar and
Javed Miandad are here?

1661
01:56:37,269 --> 01:56:38,269
What do we do?

1662
01:56:38,504 --> 01:56:40,199
Wait. Let me ask.

1663
01:56:45,811 --> 01:56:47,006
Send them in.

1664
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:48,680
Okay.

1665
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:57,849
Sir, Javed was in the
city for a TV program.

1666
01:56:58,224 --> 01:57:00,852
And he had a strong desire
to see you and meet you.

1667
01:57:00,926 --> 01:57:01,926
Okay.

1668
01:57:01,961 --> 01:57:02,553
Give it.

1669
01:57:02,628 --> 01:57:03,988
- So I brought him along.
- Thanks.

1670
01:57:04,029 --> 01:57:05,029
Try these fritters.

1671
01:57:05,831 --> 01:57:08,112
You will never taste anything
like this back in your home.

1672
01:57:12,505 --> 01:57:17,204
Sir, I've heard praises about
your passion and knowledge of cricket.

1673
01:57:18,978 --> 01:57:21,572
I had a wish...

1674
01:57:22,047 --> 01:57:25,210
I mean I had a request...

1675
01:57:26,085 --> 01:57:29,248
If we could resume playing
cricket with India again...

1676
01:57:31,190 --> 01:57:32,248
What's this Colonel?

1677
01:57:34,226 --> 01:57:35,226
What is he saying?

1678
01:57:36,228 --> 01:57:40,665
Yes, sir... without
your permission, they...

1679
01:57:45,638 --> 01:57:49,802
Yes, Saheb. If both countries
start playing cricket matches again...

1680
01:57:49,875 --> 01:57:52,003
then the condition can get much better.

1681
01:57:52,077 --> 01:57:53,077
Would you like a beer?

1682
01:57:54,513 --> 01:57:55,537
Beer... Sir.

1683
01:57:55,614 --> 01:57:56,979
No, thank you.

1684
01:57:59,919 --> 01:58:01,439
I still remember your shot, the sixer.

1685
01:58:02,521 --> 01:58:03,521
Excellent shot!

1686
01:58:03,756 --> 01:58:04,518
Thank you sir.

1687
01:58:04,590 --> 01:58:05,785
You played really well.

1688
01:58:08,227 --> 01:58:11,788
What was on your mind during that shot?

1689
01:58:13,032 --> 01:58:15,126
Nothing, in particular, Sir.

1690
01:58:16,068 --> 01:58:19,698
It was just a do and die situation,
so I just took that shot.

1691
01:58:23,242 --> 01:58:24,767
But honestly speaking sir,

1692
01:58:25,044 --> 01:58:29,242
that was the only bad ball
in the entire match by Chetan Sharma.

1693
01:58:30,082 --> 01:58:36,146
Otherwise, if you see his bowling
analysis, he played pretty well.

1694
01:58:36,689 --> 01:58:41,752
But after they lost, everyone
just pounced on him, unfortunately.

1695
01:58:41,827 --> 01:58:43,056
That's how it is.

1696
01:58:45,164 --> 01:58:49,032
We want to win every
battle against Pakistan.

1697
01:58:55,441 --> 01:59:00,811
Cricket is the only medium that can bring
harmony between both the countries.

1698
01:59:07,953 --> 01:59:08,953
What do you think?

1699
01:59:10,189 --> 01:59:11,189
No, sir...

1700
01:59:11,924 --> 01:59:16,486
I was thinking that you
shouldn't put a stop cricket.

1701
01:59:16,562 --> 01:59:18,587
Please let both the countries play.

1702
01:59:18,764 --> 01:59:20,755
By Grace of Allah,
it will be better for us.

1703
01:59:23,569 --> 01:59:27,062
You think about the game and I...

1704
01:59:29,241 --> 01:59:31,642
think about my country
that plays cricket.

1705
01:59:36,882 --> 01:59:37,906
One more thing...

1706
01:59:38,717 --> 01:59:41,118
Your batting wasn't good
enough to make me forget...

1707
01:59:41,754 --> 01:59:45,748
the pain of those families
that lost a member at the border.

1708
01:59:46,125 --> 01:59:47,125
Drink your tea.

1709
01:59:52,531 --> 01:59:56,900
By the way, sir, even the government
wants to talk to you on this issue.

1710
02:00:00,806 --> 02:00:06,506
In order to play one needs
a ground and not the government.

1711
02:02:01,727 --> 02:02:05,061
Saheb, we took four men
in custody some days ago.

1712
02:02:06,431 --> 02:02:07,796
We even questioned them.

1713
02:02:09,067 --> 02:02:13,061
According to the
information they gave us...

1714
02:02:14,973 --> 02:02:15,872
Speak up.

1715
02:02:15,941 --> 02:02:17,841
It was a conspiracy
to murder you, Saheb.

1716
02:02:20,546 --> 02:02:22,537
We were lucky to know in advance...

1717
02:02:22,614 --> 02:02:25,515
but we acted immediately
as we got the information.

1718
02:02:34,126 --> 02:02:35,218
Who were they?

1719
02:03:22,574 --> 02:03:25,100
Miyan, the chicken is simply delicious.

1720
02:03:25,644 --> 02:03:26,839
Now serve me kebabs.

1721
02:03:27,846 --> 02:03:28,870
Shinde.

1722
02:03:44,129 --> 02:03:45,722
No, sir...

1723
02:03:45,797 --> 02:03:46,958
No, sir...

1724
02:03:47,499 --> 02:03:49,024
No, sir...

1725
02:03:49,468 --> 02:03:50,833
No, sir...

1726
02:03:54,006 --> 02:03:55,030
Miyan...

1727
02:03:57,643 --> 02:03:58,701
No, sir...

1728
02:03:58,977 --> 02:03:59,739
Sir. Sir.

1729
02:03:59,811 --> 02:04:01,506
Remember anything.

1730
02:04:04,683 --> 02:04:09,484
Last year... we planned
to kill Thackeray...

1731
02:04:09,554 --> 02:04:10,953
You...

1732
02:04:13,692 --> 02:04:15,490
Thackeray Saheb.

1733
02:04:16,628 --> 02:04:17,720
Thackeray...

1734
02:04:18,764 --> 02:04:19,764
Thackeray...

1735
02:04:20,032 --> 02:04:21,193
Saheb.

1736
02:04:21,633 --> 02:04:22,099
Saheb.

1737
02:04:22,167 --> 02:04:23,430
Thackeray...

1738
02:04:23,502 --> 02:04:23,968
Thackeray...

1739
02:04:24,036 --> 02:04:25,060
Saheb...

1740
02:04:25,137 --> 02:04:26,137
Saheb...

1741
02:04:26,438 --> 02:04:27,438
Continue.

1742
02:04:28,974 --> 02:04:32,604
We had planned to kill
Bal Thackeray in Bhawan.

1743
02:04:33,178 --> 02:04:34,646
But it failed.

1744
02:04:36,048 --> 02:04:39,746
So, this time we planned to
kill him during the rally on Dussera.

1745
02:04:41,620 --> 02:04:43,110
I live in Bar-tare.

1746
02:04:43,622 --> 02:04:44,453
Sir, take this.

1747
02:04:44,523 --> 02:04:45,922
I met uncle Naeem over there.

1748
02:04:47,025 --> 02:04:48,754
He introduced us to the master mind.

1749
02:04:49,161 --> 02:04:50,925
And then we started with the training.

1750
02:04:52,097 --> 02:04:54,498
They explained us the
entire map of this area.

1751
02:04:54,700 --> 02:04:56,168
And the master mind said that.

1752
02:04:56,802 --> 02:04:58,702
You will attain salvation..

1753
02:04:59,004 --> 02:05:00,768
If you do this.

1754
02:05:41,013 --> 02:05:43,880
- Has this case gone on record yet?
- No.

1755
02:05:48,153 --> 02:05:51,987
After today, make sure no one should
ever know about this ever.

1756
02:05:52,691 --> 02:05:53,157
Sir.

1757
02:05:53,225 --> 02:05:55,626
Every trivial issue
is used to spark riots here.

1758
02:05:55,694 --> 02:05:57,685
And it's our own people
that die in these riots.

1759
02:05:57,763 --> 02:06:00,198
But Saheb, you must be careful.

1760
02:06:00,699 --> 02:06:05,034
I mean if you can avoid going out
for a few days, then it'll be better.

1761
02:06:05,670 --> 02:06:07,035
And definitely not out of Mumbai.

1762
02:06:07,105 --> 02:06:08,573
Why? Scared of these as****?

1763
02:06:11,076 --> 02:06:12,356
Elections are around the corner.

1764
02:06:13,512 --> 02:06:16,152
I'll have to make a tour of Maharastra
for promotions and meetings.

1765
02:06:17,816 --> 02:06:20,251
And my Sainiks are
capable of protecting me.

1766
02:06:20,986 --> 02:06:22,215
Why take a risk, sir?

1767
02:06:31,963 --> 02:06:34,057
The color of bullet
that touches my body...

1768
02:06:34,132 --> 02:06:37,033
That colour will be wiped from the
face of this country, Officer.

1769
02:06:52,184 --> 02:06:54,846
All my Hindu brothers,
sisters, and my Mothers!

1770
02:07:05,664 --> 02:07:07,496
I don't believe in democracy.

1771
02:07:07,999 --> 02:07:10,764
Democracy never existed
in this country.

1772
02:07:14,940 --> 02:07:17,637
They question me whether
I am Mumbai's Hitler?

1773
02:07:17,709 --> 02:07:20,178
Not just Mumbai,
I am the Hitler of entire Maharashtra.

1774
02:07:20,245 --> 02:07:22,205
And someday I'll become
this country's Hitler too.

1775
02:07:23,482 --> 02:07:25,610
If you can't maintain Law and Order...

1776
02:07:26,017 --> 02:07:30,250
then I'll have to give
guns to all my Sainiks.

1777
02:07:33,525 --> 02:07:37,189
I don't mind if my Shiv Sainiks are
called goons, but I don't want cowards.

1778
02:07:39,798 --> 02:07:43,701
Shiv Sena Bhawan was attacked,
There was an attack attempted on me...

1779
02:07:43,768 --> 02:07:45,568
and you want my Shiv
Sainiks to stay quiet?

1780
02:07:45,804 --> 02:07:47,272
I don't need to give orders.

1781
02:07:47,772 --> 02:07:49,612
The Hindus were enraged... and
riots broke out.

1782
02:07:55,614 --> 02:07:56,877
What Aurangabad?

1783
02:07:57,516 --> 02:07:58,950
Why remember that tyrant Aurangzeb?

1784
02:07:59,651 --> 02:08:03,849
If you want to remember someone,
then remember Sambhaji Maharaj.

1785
02:08:04,523 --> 02:08:05,752
No more Aurangabad.

1786
02:08:06,758 --> 02:08:09,693
From today we'll call
this land as Sambhaji Nagar.

1787
02:08:14,699 --> 02:08:17,066
The Shiv Sena President
doesn't need to give orders.

1788
02:08:17,135 --> 02:08:22,471
It's my Sainik's responsibility that no one
dares to raise even an eyebrow on women.

1789
02:08:26,978 --> 02:08:28,070
Police are attacked.

1790
02:08:28,547 --> 02:08:31,539
If the Police are insecure,
then what about the public.

1791
02:08:31,750 --> 02:08:33,684
My message to those
Police officers are...

1792
02:08:33,752 --> 02:08:35,618
that this is the
land of Shivaji Maharaj.

1793
02:08:35,687 --> 02:08:37,781
Who are you scared of?
Why are you scared?

1794
02:08:37,956 --> 02:08:40,316
If someone dares to raise
a hand on you, then take him down.

1795
02:08:40,859 --> 02:08:42,759
You have my support.

1796
02:08:49,067 --> 02:08:51,661
Don't mistake these for waves,
because this is an ocean.

1797
02:08:51,937 --> 02:08:54,770
And it will stay this way.

1798
02:08:54,839 --> 02:08:57,618
The orange flag of Shivaji's reign will
flutter in the skies of Maharashtra...

1799
02:08:57,642 --> 02:08:59,474
and I will make sure it does.

1800
02:08:59,778 --> 02:09:01,769
This is my promise to you.

1801
02:09:20,999 --> 02:09:23,127
The Shiv Sena BJP alliance

1802
02:09:23,201 --> 02:09:26,762
has opened doors for Shiv
Sena to the CM's post.

1803
02:09:26,838 --> 02:09:32,777
For the first time in history, on 14th
March 1995, in Shivaji Park Dadar...

1804
02:09:32,844 --> 02:09:37,611
Mr.Manohar Joshi from Shiv Sena
will swear in as the Prime Minister...

1805
02:09:56,935 --> 02:09:59,063
I, Manohar Gajanan Joshi.

1806
02:09:59,971 --> 02:10:01,905
Swear in the name of god...

1807
02:10:03,008 --> 02:10:10,916
that I will bear true faith and
allegiance to the Constitution of India.

1808
02:10:13,718 --> 02:10:19,213
That I will uphold the sovereignty
and integrity of India...

1809
02:10:20,792 --> 02:10:23,557
that I will faithfully and
conscientiously discharge my duties...

1810
02:10:23,628 --> 02:10:26,893
as a Chief Minister
for the state of Maharashtra...

1811
02:10:27,832 --> 02:10:31,530
and that I will do right to all

1812
02:10:32,070 --> 02:10:36,507
manner of people in accordance
with the Constitution...

1813
02:10:36,775 --> 02:10:40,541
and the law, without fear or favor,
affection or ill-will.

1814
02:10:40,879 --> 02:10:43,678
I, Manohar Gajanan Joshi.

1815
02:10:43,848 --> 02:10:45,816
Swear in the name of God

1816
02:10:46,184 --> 02:10:51,987
I will not directly
or indirectly communicate

1817
02:10:52,057 --> 02:10:55,755
or reveal to any person or persons...

1818
02:10:56,094 --> 02:11:00,053
any matter which shall
be brought under my consideration...

1819
02:11:00,131 --> 02:11:03,829
or shall become known
to me as a Minister...

1820
02:11:03,902 --> 02:11:07,634
for the state of Maharashtra
except as may be required...

1821
02:11:07,772 --> 02:11:14,439
for the due discharge
of my duties as such Minister.

1822
02:11:40,839 --> 02:11:43,900
Do you plead guilty or not guilty?

1823
02:11:45,076 --> 02:11:46,168
Yes.

1824
02:11:49,514 --> 02:11:50,606
I plead guilty.

1825
02:11:54,886 --> 02:11:59,187
If loving this country is a crime,
then I am a criminal.

1826
02:12:03,128 --> 02:12:06,462
If caring for my people is a crime,
then I am a criminal.

1827
02:12:07,866 --> 02:12:11,632
People are not for the Law,
the Law is for the people.

1828
02:12:14,205 --> 02:12:17,573
The country has always
made me stand in this witness box...

1829
02:12:17,742 --> 02:12:20,662
but the people of this country will
decide whether I am right or wrong.

1830
02:12:20,779 --> 02:12:24,841
Because I only believe in one court,
and that's the people's court.

1831
02:12:28,720 --> 02:12:36,650
I gave courage to those whose spines
were shattered by this Capitalism.

1832
02:12:36,728 --> 02:12:37,854
Is that my crime?

1833
02:12:40,832 --> 02:12:43,733
This system which gagged
the society for many years...

1834
02:12:43,868 --> 02:12:46,180
I became the society's voice
and challenged this system.

1835
02:12:46,204 --> 02:12:46,898
Is that my crime?

1836
02:12:46,971 --> 02:12:49,565
And if that is a crime,
then I'm prepared to do it again.

1837
02:12:54,779 --> 02:12:57,979
In this system, it becomes necessary to
resort to violence after a point of time.

1838
02:12:58,183 --> 02:12:59,183
I was an artist.

1839
02:13:00,452 --> 02:13:01,852
First I used my brush as my weapon.

1840
02:13:01,986 --> 02:13:04,421
But, when it was incapable
of giving justice to the people...

1841
02:13:04,489 --> 02:13:08,585
just like our judicial system,
then I believed it was necessary...

1842
02:13:08,660 --> 02:13:10,924
to resort to every kind
of violence for justice.

1843
02:13:11,563 --> 02:13:12,587
It was justified.

1844
02:13:13,465 --> 02:13:15,627
And our history is
full of such examples.

1845
02:13:16,601 --> 02:13:18,035
Yes, I plead guilty.

1846
02:13:22,807 --> 02:13:27,608
And, even if you hang me
for this crime, I still accept.

1847
02:13:28,947 --> 02:13:33,043
Every crime I committed shall run through
the blood of my people as an ideology...

1848
02:13:33,117 --> 02:13:37,645
and this Bal Keshav Thackeray shall
thrive in every drop of that blood!

1849
02:14:25,003 --> 02:14:27,472
"Heart filled With light."

1850
02:14:28,940 --> 02:14:30,874
"And a body that glows like amber."

1851
02:14:32,810 --> 02:14:38,078
"Courage... like none other."

1852
02:14:40,485 --> 02:14:45,480
"The leader... of the people."

1853
02:14:45,557 --> 02:14:48,185
"The leader..."

1854
02:14:48,459 --> 02:14:54,455
"You are their protector."

1855
02:14:56,467 --> 02:15:00,028
"Those without any help or support..."

1856
02:15:00,104 --> 02:15:04,041
"you became their backbone."

1857
02:15:04,108 --> 02:15:07,942
"You are Saheb, you are the government."

1858
02:15:08,012 --> 02:15:11,846
"You are the great leader."

1859
02:15:11,916 --> 02:15:15,750
"You are Saheb, you are the government."

1860
02:15:15,820 --> 02:15:19,688
"You are the great leader."

1861
02:16:04,736 --> 02:16:09,503
"You chose the path of
truth and honesty."

1862
02:16:09,574 --> 02:16:13,477
"You dwelled in every heart,
and heard their plea."

1863
02:16:13,544 --> 02:16:17,174
"You showered everyone
with your generosity."

1864
02:16:17,248 --> 02:16:19,216
"You welcomed everyone.

1865
02:16:19,550 --> 02:16:23,680
"And became one with them."

1866
02:16:25,023 --> 02:16:28,823
"You defeated every evil."

1867
02:16:28,893 --> 02:16:32,727
"You took on all the pain,
while spreading happiness."

1868
02:16:32,797 --> 02:16:36,563
"You fought for everyone's happiness..."

1869
02:16:36,634 --> 02:16:41,538
"till your last breath
you thought only for the country."

1870
02:16:42,974 --> 02:16:46,706
"The one who had nowhere to go..."

1871
02:16:46,844 --> 02:16:50,803
"you became their backbone."

1872
02:16:50,982 --> 02:16:54,282
"You are Saheb, you are the government."

1873
02:16:54,519 --> 02:16:58,547
"You are the great leader.

1874
02:16:58,623 --> 02:17:02,116
"You are Saheb, you are the government."

1875
02:17:02,193 --> 02:17:06,858
"You are the great leader"
