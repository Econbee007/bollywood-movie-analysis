1
00:03:28,316 --> 00:03:29,408
Sir..

2
00:04:15,597 --> 00:04:18,259
Susanna Anna Marie Johannes-

3
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:21,594
Prima facie, suicide

4
00:04:22,938 --> 00:04:25,771
She set ablaze not only
herself but her mansion too

5
00:04:26,908 --> 00:04:30,537
Married to 6 men, and
strangely all of them dead.

6
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:32,938
She must have been one hell of a lay

7
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:35,875
Well..

8
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:37,908
I'm sure you've seen
what we've recovered..

9
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:41,284
Skull, some bones,
ash, make up kit etc

10
00:04:42,424 --> 00:04:43,857
We need to carry out DNA profiling.

11
00:04:44,392 --> 00:04:46,656
Hope you're not too busy?

12
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:53,059
I'll do it.

13
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:54,427
It's a priority case

14
00:04:54,936 --> 00:04:56,927
and the police want to
ensure that she's dead.

15
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:41,741
Arun..

16
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,044
What are you doing?

17
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:00,023
How come you never
showed this to me?

18
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:02,360
Why?

19
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,766
Secret?

20
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:17,977
Is this 'the Susanna'?

21
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:22,320
''Saheb.'' [Master]

22
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:26,693
Now, she's no more.

23
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,467
Detached from life,
and torn apart by love..

24
00:06:39,841 --> 00:06:42,708
My ''Saheb'' was melancholic.

25
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:48,547
All her life, she was in
search for her eternal love.

26
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:54,479
She was very lonely.

27
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:59,320
Just an infant when
she lost her mother..

28
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,928
And before she could become
an adult, her father died.

29
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,857
My senior ''Saheb''. [Her father]

30
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,663
He was her everything!

31
00:07:09,237 --> 00:07:11,569
Friend, mother, and brother.

32
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,502
And after he was gone..

33
00:07:14,576 --> 00:07:18,740
.. she tried hard to find
him in every man she could.

34
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,450
On the day of her father's funeral..

35
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:34,519
.. in full black attire, she
reminded me of soft snow..

36
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:41,562
.. rolling off the
mountain in the silent night.

37
00:07:49,744 --> 00:07:51,769
No wonder she radiated in black.

38
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:57,476
And soon, it became her colour.

39
00:08:07,262 --> 00:08:08,354
Uncle Goonga!

40
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,892
Too much to say, but
unfortunately born dumb.

41
00:08:13,735 --> 00:08:15,327
I was born an orphan!

42
00:08:16,471 --> 00:08:21,932
Don't know if he
adopted me or I adopted him.

43
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,349
My first real competition.

44
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:30,942
And senior ''Saheb's'' last wish.

45
00:08:31,486 --> 00:08:32,680
The first husband..

46
00:08:32,987 --> 00:08:34,852
Major Edwin Rodriques.

47
00:08:38,793 --> 00:08:39,885
Goonga!

48
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:41,890
How much longer?

49
00:08:47,969 --> 00:08:49,027
Ghalib!

50
00:08:49,304 --> 00:08:50,498
What in the devil is he saying?

51
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,931
He says, everything should be
ready in the next half an hour.

52
00:08:59,614 --> 00:09:03,277
I don't want to see
any of his rats around.

53
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,816
Ghalib.

54
00:09:11,392 --> 00:09:15,988
Poet by name, butler by profession
and mocks a Bollywood villain.

55
00:09:26,374 --> 00:09:27,432
Anything else, sir?

56
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,538
What did he say?

57
00:09:32,647 --> 00:09:34,740
Thank you, sir!

58
00:09:45,393 --> 00:09:50,296
If he knew you were calling him
a fucker he'd pull your eyes out.

59
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,903
Ghalib!
- Sir!

60
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,746
The third ace in her trio.

61
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,315
Maggie aunty!

62
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:13,283
Under whose care ''Saheb'' grew up.

63
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:16,819
She became her mother
and her best friend.

64
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,951
She had a few other friends too.

65
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,729
Venomous, dangerous..

66
00:10:29,404 --> 00:10:31,872
.. but faithful like no other.

67
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,836
It's a Derby, darling!

68
00:10:37,946 --> 00:10:39,914
The jockey is as
important as the stallion.

69
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:44,919
I don't see any
reason for change, Rod.

70
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:48,349
Goonga was daddy's
favourite jockey.

71
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:55,687
What do you think, Martha?

72
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,491
I'm think someone here
may have a better idea.

73
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:00,329
Right, Tim?

74
00:11:01,469 --> 00:11:02,697
What do you have to say, Mr. Rangan?

75
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:06,806
Why don't we hire a
professional rider from abroad?

76
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:10,005
We can afford it and
I know one in Prague.

77
00:11:10,478 --> 00:11:13,038
Affordability was
never an issue, Mr. Rangan.

78
00:11:13,748 --> 00:11:15,511
Professional jockey from Prague..

79
00:11:16,751 --> 00:11:18,343
You boy

80
00:11:19,821 --> 00:11:20,913
What do you think you're doing?

81
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,352
Stealing!

82
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,052
Come here.

83
00:11:28,463 --> 00:11:29,555
Come on.

84
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,926
Show me your hands!

85
00:11:35,436 --> 00:11:36,528
Come on!

86
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,307
Whose rascal is this?

87
00:11:44,445 --> 00:11:47,539
I picked a few for Candy, Sir.

88
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:49,575
Who's Candy?

89
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:51,384
Your new horse.

90
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,077
That's a nice name for a horse.

91
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,317
Candy.

92
00:11:56,391 --> 00:11:59,019
He runs fast when he eat it Sir.

93
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:03,523
How much have you studied?

94
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,559
Seven and a half.

95
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,268
Anything else?

96
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:14,334
Yes, ''Saheb''. Candy loves you.

97
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:18,306
You tik-tok-tik-tok..

98
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:21,280
him in race, and win 'Dabry'!

99
00:12:58,753 --> 00:12:59,845
Miss ''Saheb'', forgive me!

100
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,255
Thought I'd help this orphan.

101
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,519
Will send this fool
back to the village.

102
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:09,822
You won't see this rat anymore.

103
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:19,031
You're right!

104
00:13:22,443 --> 00:13:23,933
He won't be seen here anymore.

105
00:13:27,381 --> 00:13:28,712
Because he'll be
starting school tomorrow.

106
00:13:35,723 --> 00:13:36,781
Okay.

107
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:40,953
Sugar.

108
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:44,429
''Saheb'', thank you!

109
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,387
Snap! My life
changed in a split second.

110
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:13,725
''Saheb'' picked me up
from a bed of thorns..

111
00:14:13,995 --> 00:14:15,519
and placed me on a bed of roses.

112
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,025
This is the new
admission I was talking about.

113
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,737
She was my goddess.

114
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,343
And I her blind devotee.

115
00:14:39,554 --> 00:14:42,853
All said and done Arun, the
Major was pretty handsome.

116
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,956
Quite a dashing fellow.

117
00:14:47,795 --> 00:14:50,696
The perfect Indian husband.

118
00:14:51,966 --> 00:14:58,337
Boring, possessive,
insecure and a doubting Thomas.

119
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,570
And a fart king too.

120
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:02,401
Mr. Stinker!

121
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,541
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention please.

122
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:12,753
Here's to our very own,
Major Edwin Rodriques.

123
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,813
The recipient of
the gallantry award.

124
00:15:16,724 --> 00:15:18,817
Cheers!
- Cheers!

125
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,494
We salute the bravery
and courage you displayed

126
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:26,394
all throughout operation Blue Star.

127
00:15:26,701 --> 00:15:30,694
It took a heavy toll on our brigade
and on your company in particular.

128
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,564
And my leg!

129
00:15:42,617 --> 00:15:43,845
Hey beautiful!

130
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:48,346
I can't figure out if you're
getting older or younger by the day.

131
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:52,452
Edwin is greying fast
but you look the same.

132
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,952
Thank you!

133
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:58,396
Here, for your
beautiful better half.

134
00:16:00,768 --> 00:16:01,826
She's quit drinking.

135
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,930
Really, since when?

136
00:16:04,705 --> 00:16:07,640
Today, I quit every morning.

137
00:16:08,376 --> 00:16:12,870
And that Brigadier Venkat, is
the secret of my beauty! Cheers!

138
00:16:13,447 --> 00:16:14,505
Cheers!

139
00:16:14,815 --> 00:16:16,544
Good evening, sir!
- Good evening.

140
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:18,509
May I have the pleasure of a dance..

141
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,283
.. with the lady..

142
00:16:24,892 --> 00:16:26,553
I always had two left feet.

143
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,487
Now I've lost one.

144
00:18:24,412 --> 00:18:25,845
Really!

145
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,310
You're quite the dancer, lieutenant.

146
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:32,248
Sir.

147
00:18:32,753 --> 00:18:36,951
But no match to your
beautiful half, sir.

148
00:18:40,895 --> 00:18:42,260
Beautiful half.

149
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,900
And the better one too.

150
00:18:56,777 --> 00:18:58,506
And she has a
beautiful name as well.

151
00:19:01,582 --> 00:19:02,776
Susanna.

152
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,447
What?

153
00:19:17,431 --> 00:19:18,489
Susanna.

154
00:19:27,408 --> 00:19:28,670
But you can call her..

155
00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:32,541
Mrs. Rodriques, if you please.

156
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,942
Thank you.

157
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:46,859
You know you can't
handle the fucking alcohol.

158
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,393
''I quit every morning.''

159
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:56,802
Stop fluttering around.

160
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,304
You're a married woman.

161
00:20:09,517 --> 00:20:12,418
Are you ashamed to be my wife?

162
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:19,525
Then why?

163
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:42,749
Why do you keep
reminding me of my disability?

164
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,946
I'm sorry.

165
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,634
It's high time we had a child.

166
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:19,981
Once you're a mother,
you'll learn wifely duties too.

167
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,471
Did you visit the gynaecologist?

168
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,783
All tests are normal.

169
00:21:55,756 --> 00:21:57,053
Then why can't you conceive?

170
00:22:04,298 --> 00:22:07,426
The doctor says, there's
nothing wrong with me.

171
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,344
So now..

172
00:22:22,816 --> 00:22:24,340
I'm disabled in bed too?

173
00:22:34,294 --> 00:22:38,594
''I've come from Alabama,
with a banjo on my knee.. ''

174
00:22:44,672 --> 00:22:49,837
''Oh Susanna! Won't
you cry for me.. ''

175
00:23:17,638 --> 00:23:23,543
How often have I told you
to knock before entering?

176
00:23:25,746 --> 00:23:27,737
Knock, knock!

177
00:23:35,823 --> 00:23:40,351
Next time, I'll bury you alive.

178
00:23:55,843 --> 00:23:57,868
This was bound to happen,
my friends!

179
00:23:58,846 --> 00:24:01,474
Marry in a haste and..

180
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,949
Repent at leisure.

181
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,390
You want to break his other leg?

182
00:24:16,964 --> 00:24:19,262
Don't fuck around with him.

183
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:22,627
At the end of the day,
you'll be the one to be fucked.

184
00:24:40,788 --> 00:24:43,348
Sir! Are you alright?

185
00:24:43,423 --> 00:24:44,515
You bastard!

186
00:24:50,397 --> 00:24:51,557
Son of a bitch.

187
00:25:07,681 --> 00:25:08,978
So you want to fight?

188
00:25:37,711 --> 00:25:39,542
Goonga.. Goonga..

189
00:25:39,613 --> 00:25:41,308
Goonga.. Goonga..

190
00:25:56,063 --> 00:25:59,760
Goonga.. Goonga..

191
00:26:11,745 --> 00:26:13,235
Goonga.. Goonga..

192
00:27:50,844 --> 00:27:51,970
Goonga.. what happened?

193
00:27:52,412 --> 00:27:53,470
What happened?

194
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:55,373
What happened?

195
00:27:57,851 --> 00:27:59,785
Ghalib.. Ghalib!

196
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,393
He will survive.

197
00:28:11,598 --> 00:28:13,793
But we're sorry, we
couldn't save his eye.

198
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,606
One eye is enough to
witness what's going to happen.

199
00:28:48,902 --> 00:28:51,666
The next time I saw the
Major for the last time.

200
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:56,671
Going in search of
the man-eating panther.

201
00:29:20,934 --> 00:29:22,731
Can I also have a drink tonight?

202
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:27,399
Just a drink?

203
00:29:29,242 --> 00:29:30,334
No.

204
00:29:31,545 --> 00:29:32,705
Minimum three.

205
00:29:33,847 --> 00:29:35,246
And you should be fun!

206
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:48,554
We must be very still, very quiet..

207
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,827
.. or the animal won't come.

208
00:29:55,635 --> 00:29:56,966
The beast in me is already here.

209
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:02,599
Major sir.

210
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:03,935
Major sir, panther.

211
00:30:39,613 --> 00:30:42,844
The panther wasn't
interested in the goat.

212
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,445
He was looking for humans.

213
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:50,448
Can't tell whether the
Major lost his balance..

214
00:30:51,691 --> 00:30:53,818
Or whether someone pushed him.

215
00:30:54,461 --> 00:30:55,655
Nevertheless..

216
00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:58,591
it took the forest officials
two days to find the Major..

217
00:30:58,665 --> 00:31:03,034
.. or whatever was left of him.

218
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:22,582
I just couldn't get
myself to mourn for the Major.

219
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:28,425
Had fate given me another chance..

220
00:31:28,495 --> 00:31:29,894
.. to woo my ''Saheb''?

221
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,765
Like a balloon my
hopes went soaring.

222
00:31:39,673 --> 00:31:44,303
But she chose the guitar instead.

223
00:32:54,414 --> 00:32:59,977
Indian women fall for a
guitarist over a riff.

224
00:33:00,654 --> 00:33:03,020
And this asshole had
the vocal chords too.

225
00:33:08,561 --> 00:33:12,588
Before the wedding this creature
was called Jamshed Singh Rathod.

226
00:33:13,566 --> 00:33:15,363
From now I'm Jimmy.

227
00:33:15,969 --> 00:33:17,334
Jimmy Stetson.

228
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:19,832
You can call me Jim.

229
00:33:21,308 --> 00:33:23,674
And you call me.. Susie.

230
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:26,370
Jim and Susie!

231
00:33:26,913 --> 00:33:28,005
Susie and Jim!

232
00:33:29,983 --> 00:33:33,749
Made for each other, that's right!

233
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,937
''Her lips were ripe and so close''

234
00:33:53,506 --> 00:33:54,996
''O Mama''

235
00:33:56,476 --> 00:33:58,603
''O Mama''

236
00:34:00,447 --> 00:34:05,578
''I looked at them and all but froze''

237
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:08,510
''O Mama''

238
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,649
''O Mama''

239
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,623
You wrote this for me?

240
00:34:17,297 --> 00:34:20,391
No, it sprung from within.

241
00:34:21,401 --> 00:34:22,629
My wedding gift to you.

242
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:46,053
''O Mama''

243
00:34:50,029 --> 00:34:52,657
''O Mama''

244
00:34:56,569 --> 00:34:59,470
''O Mama''

245
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:01,529
''O Mama''

246
00:35:03,843 --> 00:35:08,746
''My heart now only
thinks from the heart''

247
00:35:10,383 --> 00:35:12,681
''O Mama''

248
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,282
''O Mama''

249
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:22,250
''My heart often bangs my head''

250
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:26,397
''O Mama''

251
00:35:26,766 --> 00:35:29,963
''O Mama''

252
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,838
''No stranger to me''

253
00:35:33,573 --> 00:35:36,474
''May my fall be her rise''

254
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:43,042
''She, my nemesis, too,
is no stranger to me''

255
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:49,647
''A beating heart
forever stays beaten''

256
00:35:51,925 --> 00:35:54,621
''O Mama''

257
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,558
''O Mama''

258
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,462
''O Mama, she shoots at me''

259
00:36:01,835 --> 00:36:08,604
''this marble-eyed meow-like girl''

260
00:36:08,675 --> 00:36:11,007
''O Mama''

261
00:36:11,911 --> 00:36:15,711
''O Mama''

262
00:36:35,768 --> 00:36:40,728
''She steals on me, not
a sound she makes.. ''

263
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,805
''O Mama''

264
00:36:45,645 --> 00:36:51,481
''She smuggles herself into my
dreams, pray it doesn't stay a dream''

265
00:36:51,684 --> 00:36:54,812
''O Mama''

266
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:58,413
''There isn't hope''

267
00:36:58,725 --> 00:37:01,387
''But hope remains, still''

268
00:37:01,895 --> 00:37:07,925
''How I languish in
the anguish of love''

269
00:37:08,701 --> 00:37:14,367
''Something's being ripped out of me''

270
00:37:16,976 --> 00:37:19,376
''O Mama''

271
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,812
''O Mama''

272
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:26,676
''O Mama, she shoots at me''

273
00:37:26,986 --> 00:37:34,415
''this marble-eyed meow-like girl''

274
00:37:36,996 --> 00:37:39,692
''O Mama''

275
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:43,026
''O Mama''

276
00:37:43,436 --> 00:37:45,904
''O Mama''

277
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:51,341
Welcome back to
''Cultivation Today''..

278
00:37:58,051 --> 00:38:02,818
''She's taken on the reign,
this world is her's not mine.. ''

279
00:38:04,424 --> 00:38:06,483
''O Mama''

280
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,791
''O Mama''

281
00:38:11,297 --> 00:38:15,734
''How do I believe her love,
it's undefined''

282
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:19,395
''O Mama''

283
00:38:20,573 --> 00:38:21,835
''O Mama''

284
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:25,869
''Should've let the light inside''

285
00:38:26,412 --> 00:38:28,972
''For my heart and mind divide''

286
00:38:29,382 --> 00:38:34,547
''Have you lost me to her spell''

287
00:38:34,887 --> 00:38:37,856
''O Mama''

288
00:38:37,924 --> 00:38:39,289
''O Mama''

289
00:38:40,727 --> 00:38:41,853
''O Mama''

290
00:38:41,995 --> 00:38:43,257
''Won't you help me''

291
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:44,694
Okay that's enough!

292
00:38:45,832 --> 00:38:47,322
What's the proof this is yours?

293
00:38:49,268 --> 00:38:50,735
This was my college composition.

294
00:38:51,804 --> 00:38:54,534
Jamshed was the backup
vocalist in my band.

295
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:57,401
Bloody robber.

296
00:38:58,444 --> 00:38:59,809
Where the hell is he? Call him.

297
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:03,349
Here's proof.

298
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:08,285
It first came out in English, now
they're launching the holy version.

299
00:39:08,755 --> 00:39:12,782
''O Mother.. O Mother.. ''

300
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,328
Which record label?

301
00:39:19,332 --> 00:39:21,527
Now what?

302
00:39:22,468 --> 00:39:23,662
Respect.

303
00:39:28,675 --> 00:39:29,937
Shall we?

304
00:39:37,617 --> 00:39:40,643
Thanks man! Here's
a new composition.

305
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,317
Interested?

306
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:00,034
''At heart, the heart's just a heart''

307
00:40:00,306 --> 00:40:02,035
''At heart, the heart's just a heart''

308
00:40:06,012 --> 00:40:08,310
''At heart, the heart's just a heart''

309
00:40:08,381 --> 00:40:09,848
''At heart, the heart's just a heart''

310
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,274
''At heart, the heart's just a heart''

311
00:40:12,351 --> 00:40:13,716
''At heart, the heart's just a heart''

312
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:17,583
''Full of tricks and illusions,
Simply a smooth operator''

313
00:40:18,357 --> 00:40:21,622
''The heart's heady at
times and at times, take heart''

314
00:40:22,428 --> 00:40:25,522
''Full of tricks and illusions,
Simply a smooth operator''

315
00:40:26,399 --> 00:40:29,857
''The heart's heady at
times and at times, take heart''

316
00:40:30,703 --> 00:40:32,398
''It's just a gentle whisper,
at times and at times.. ''

317
00:40:32,705 --> 00:40:34,639
.. an uproarious drumroll''

318
00:40:34,707 --> 00:40:36,641
''At times, it's the raging fire
pulsating in your veins at times..''

319
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:39,735
''.. it is the calming coolness''

320
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,473
''Believe it or not''

321
00:40:44,617 --> 00:40:47,814
''Is only a matter of the heart''

322
00:40:48,387 --> 00:40:50,355
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

323
00:40:50,423 --> 00:40:51,913
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

324
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,891
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

325
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,723
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

326
00:40:55,928 --> 00:40:59,489
''The shore for drowning men''

327
00:40:59,966 --> 00:41:03,458
''The ignorance of the boor''

328
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,963
''A hundred heavens,
that's what it's worth''

329
00:41:06,272 --> 00:41:07,466
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

330
00:41:07,907 --> 00:41:09,738
Where are you, boss?

331
00:41:12,478 --> 00:41:14,446
The Berlin wall has collapsed..

332
00:41:16,616 --> 00:41:18,811
.. and so has the government.

333
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,950
And you're stuck on cocaine?

334
00:41:26,626 --> 00:41:29,720
This is what you call heroin!

335
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,932
No one has the balls to
behave in this manner.

336
00:41:35,468 --> 00:41:37,026
This is Bappi's song!

337
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:41,033
You know how many
musicians are waiting for him?

338
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:45,074
A hundred! Who is going to pay?

339
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:46,871
Your father?

340
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,941
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

341
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:53,044
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

342
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:54,581
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

343
00:41:55,354 --> 00:41:56,946
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

344
00:41:57,023 --> 00:41:58,615
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

345
00:41:58,925 --> 00:42:00,950
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

346
00:42:02,795 --> 00:42:06,925
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jimmy will be here soon.

347
00:42:07,466 --> 00:42:10,594
Please remain calm.
He will be here soon.

348
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,837
Please remain calm, please.

349
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:15,307
Please remain calm, please.

350
00:42:15,374 --> 00:42:16,671
In a few moments he will be here.

351
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,607
''A heart which beats.. ''

352
00:42:18,945 --> 00:42:20,913
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

353
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,607
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

354
00:42:29,021 --> 00:42:30,386
Yes, who is it.. ?

355
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:31,982
What do you want?

356
00:42:32,992 --> 00:42:34,323
Yes..

357
00:42:34,493 --> 00:42:35,892
I'm sorry.. Jimmy?

358
00:42:36,362 --> 00:42:37,454
Jimmy..

359
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,896
Jimmy boy, you've got a fan here.

360
00:42:42,001 --> 00:42:44,902
Got you.
- Bang you!

361
00:42:44,971 --> 00:42:46,962
Bang, bang, bang!

362
00:42:49,876 --> 00:42:51,503
FBI, dead! CBI, dead!

363
00:42:52,411 --> 00:42:56,074
Jimmy has the power!
- No, we are still alive.

364
00:42:57,049 --> 00:42:58,778
Jimmy is a cheater!

365
00:42:59,018 --> 00:43:00,645
Jimmy is a cheater!

366
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,754
Susie.. what are you doing here?

367
00:43:04,423 --> 00:43:05,515
Susie..

368
00:43:06,926 --> 00:43:08,018
When did you come?

369
00:43:09,262 --> 00:43:10,593
Why didn't you inform me?

370
00:43:12,732 --> 00:43:15,599
Susie, don't misunderstand.
They are just friends!

371
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,736
Just..
- Friends.

372
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,603
We were playing a game!

373
00:43:21,741 --> 00:43:22,799
Cops and robbers!

374
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:23,967
You wanna play?

375
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:25,736
Jimmy is a robber..

376
00:43:25,778 --> 00:43:27,268
Hey FBI cheater.

377
00:43:30,549 --> 00:43:32,676
Cops and robbers!

378
00:43:34,287 --> 00:43:35,584
Bang, bang, bang!

379
00:43:35,755 --> 00:43:37,450
Cops and robbers!

380
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:39,317
FBI, dead! CBI, dead!

381
00:43:41,427 --> 00:43:44,658
I got you. I got you.

382
00:43:47,733 --> 00:43:51,328
You die. You die. You die.

383
00:44:03,282 --> 00:44:05,546
This time she was determined..

384
00:44:06,385 --> 00:44:07,943
.. to save her marriage.

385
00:44:08,821 --> 00:44:12,257
This time she wouldn't give up.

386
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,928
Susie, remember..

387
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:21,860
It's Jim.

388
00:44:22,935 --> 00:44:24,266
Your Jim.

389
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,402
Why are you doing this to me?

390
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,769
I won't go back to drugs!

391
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,507
I swear.

392
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:40,944
Please, Susie!

393
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:47,651
You bitch!

394
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,326
I will choke you to
death once I'm free.

395
00:44:50,596 --> 00:44:52,723
You are messing with
Jamshed Singh Rathod.

396
00:44:53,332 --> 00:44:54,526
I am of royal blood.

397
00:44:54,934 --> 00:44:57,835
I will cut you into tiny
pieces and feed you to the dogs.

398
00:44:58,337 --> 00:44:59,429
You bitch!

399
00:45:05,344 --> 00:45:06,436
Susie..

400
00:45:08,848 --> 00:45:11,749
I can recommend a good
rehab facility in Bangalore..

401
00:45:12,351 --> 00:45:14,945
.. very private, excellent one.

402
00:45:17,623 --> 00:45:18,681
No, doctor.

403
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,518
I can't leave him alone.

404
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:29,964
He is my life.

405
00:45:30,536 --> 00:45:33,471
By now Saheb's
life began to settle..

406
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,672
Jimmy was getting better.

407
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,801
But she didn't realise
that drugs addicts..

408
00:45:40,046 --> 00:45:41,707
.. become sly once they're caught.

409
00:45:42,515 --> 00:45:44,039
'Champions of deception.'

410
00:45:46,552 --> 00:45:47,644
Sir..

411
00:45:51,424 --> 00:45:52,550
Madame.

412
00:45:54,326 --> 00:45:58,319
This was confiscated from
a drug peddler yesterday.

413
00:46:02,501 --> 00:46:08,838
Who else could own
such a beautiful piece?

414
00:46:09,408 --> 00:46:10,966
I knew, as soon as
I laid eyes on it!

415
00:46:11,944 --> 00:46:15,607
It's priceless too.. how much?

416
00:46:18,751 --> 00:46:21,777
You never put a price on
priceless things, Inspector.

417
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,448
''Keemat.'' [Price]

418
00:46:24,757 --> 00:46:26,315
Inspector Keemat Lal.

419
00:46:35,901 --> 00:46:38,028
Muzzle loader NX 6.

420
00:46:42,575 --> 00:46:44,873
Amongst the first guns
to be brought to India..

421
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:47,504
.. by the soldiers
of the British rule.

422
00:46:52,651 --> 00:46:54,778
Was a favourite in my
father's antique collection.

423
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:58,953
I'd like to question your servants.

424
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,552
A marble-eyed meow-like girl..

425
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:06,761
O doggy..

426
00:47:07,466 --> 00:47:11,232
Our servants are
more loyal than owners.

427
00:47:12,304 --> 00:47:13,362
Madame..

428
00:47:15,774 --> 00:47:16,900
Thank you.

429
00:47:17,276 --> 00:47:18,368
Madame.

430
00:47:20,279 --> 00:47:23,476
You can call me by my name,
if you please..

431
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,643
Susanna.

432
00:47:27,853 --> 00:47:31,789
How dare I.. Madame.

433
00:47:31,924 --> 00:47:34,324
Thank you. Nevertheless..

434
00:47:34,593 --> 00:47:39,860
I don't think I would ever..
maybe another time.

435
00:47:40,332 --> 00:47:44,792
Right now.. it's not appropriate.

436
00:49:52,464 --> 00:49:53,522
Jim..

437
00:50:19,825 --> 00:50:20,917
Careful, sir!

438
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,455
These snakes are venomous.

439
00:50:24,863 --> 00:50:26,660
The snake temple.

440
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,660
Snake temple?

441
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:33,665
But, Madame is a Christian.

442
00:50:35,808 --> 00:50:36,866
Yes, she is!

443
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:40,604
Her father was a Christian,
but mother, a Hindu.

444
00:50:41,347 --> 00:50:42,678
She set it up.

445
00:50:43,349 --> 00:50:45,613
Saheb feeds them milk,
every morning without fail!

446
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:47,848
How?
- She goes down.

447
00:50:48,854 --> 00:50:50,481
Isn't she scared?

448
00:50:50,622 --> 00:50:52,351
No! They're her pets.

449
00:50:52,858 --> 00:50:57,955
She thinks humans
are more poisonous.

450
00:51:01,533 --> 00:51:02,625
Wow!

451
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:06,633
That's great.

452
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:08,868
Sir, snake!

453
00:51:10,542 --> 00:51:11,975
Are you alright, sir?
- Yes, I'm fine.

454
00:51:29,395 --> 00:51:33,388
One, two, three, four, five, six..

455
00:51:35,334 --> 00:51:38,929
Six, five, four, three, two, one..

456
00:51:40,339 --> 00:51:41,738
Whose footprint is this?

457
00:51:42,841 --> 00:51:44,035
Could be anyone's..

458
00:51:45,711 --> 00:51:46,905
Notjust anyone..

459
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,672
It belongs to the murderer.

460
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,407
Murderer?

461
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:22,513
Is anyone left?
- Yes, there is.

462
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,482
Who is it?

463
00:52:35,627 --> 00:52:36,719
It's me.

464
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:53,875
Why do you bother, Madame.

465
00:52:54,313 --> 00:52:56,907
You've gotten your feet all muddy!

466
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:58,576
There is no need, Madame.

467
00:52:59,952 --> 00:53:02,443
Not Madame, Susanna.

468
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:09,520
You are just.. I mean.. how will I..

469
00:53:10,696 --> 00:53:13,722
Really.. I mean.. I mean..

470
00:53:15,634 --> 00:53:16,760
Joking!

471
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:21,635
Not right. Who am I to say!

472
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:25,672
Just as you wish.. the next time.

473
00:53:26,678 --> 00:53:32,275
But it's fine.. not a bad thing.

474
00:53:32,885 --> 00:53:33,943
I'll try next time.

475
00:53:35,888 --> 00:53:36,980
But how will I?

476
00:53:38,957 --> 00:53:44,725
It is believed that Jesus
spent his last days in Kashmir.

477
00:53:45,697 --> 00:53:48,928
''Saheb'' left for Kashmir
in search of the Lord..

478
00:53:49,801 --> 00:53:53,601
Instead of Jesus,
she met ''Mohammed''.

479
00:53:53,805 --> 00:53:55,830
Hail Allah!

480
00:53:55,908 --> 00:53:57,603
Hail Allah!

481
00:53:57,709 --> 00:53:59,939
Mohammed Wasiullah Khan.

482
00:54:00,412 --> 00:54:01,606
A.K. A The Traveller.

483
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:05,409
From the soot of
spiraling everyday smoke..

484
00:54:06,251 --> 00:54:08,811
.. a patch of sky,
now remains blackened..

485
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,389
.. all day long.

486
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:14,550
Great!
- Wonderful!

487
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:20,760
Do not bow your head beneath it..

488
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:26,404
.. for now when you prostrate,
God yanks His feet away.

489
00:54:32,444 --> 00:54:34,844
In the mounds of rotting rubbish..

490
00:54:35,614 --> 00:54:37,878
.. heads of bodies
gone cold still smoulder.

491
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:40,282
Wonderful! Wonderful!

492
00:54:40,419 --> 00:54:45,379
Hungry four legged animals, fight
over the bones of arms and legs.

493
00:54:46,558 --> 00:54:48,992
The flesh and the bone
belongs to the one..

494
00:54:49,361 --> 00:54:51,352
.. who first digs its
teeth into the flesh.

495
00:54:53,365 --> 00:54:55,424
May I proceed?
- Yes, please.

496
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,799
The flesh and the bone
belongs to the one..

497
00:54:59,404 --> 00:55:01,497
.. who first digs its
teeth into the flesh.

498
00:55:01,773 --> 00:55:06,005
The men of faith now ask, who
first dug his spade into this earth!

499
00:55:06,278 --> 00:55:09,907
Wow!
- Wonderful! - Wonderful!

500
00:55:10,248 --> 00:55:14,344
The men of faith now ask, who
first dug his spade into this earth!

501
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:16,612
Some say there was
a mosque here once.

502
00:55:16,755 --> 00:55:18,655
Some say no, once a
temple stood here.

503
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:21,523
Wow! Wow!
- Wonderful!

504
00:55:23,996 --> 00:55:26,430
But when you touch your
forehead to the ground..

505
00:55:26,498 --> 00:55:30,798
God yanks His feet away now.

506
00:55:32,404 --> 00:55:35,271
He cannot bring Himself to believe..

507
00:55:36,608 --> 00:55:39,338
He cannot bring Himself to believe..

508
00:55:39,478 --> 00:55:42,777
.. that He once called
this place, His home.

509
00:55:42,848 --> 00:55:44,315
Wow!
- Wow!

510
00:55:45,517 --> 00:55:47,007
This time, ''Saheb'' not
only had a new lover..

511
00:55:47,953 --> 00:55:51,980
.. but also a new name and religion.

512
00:55:54,026 --> 00:55:56,620
Susanna Anna Marie
Johannes was now..

513
00:55:56,862 --> 00:55:59,490
Sultana Wasiullah Khan.

514
00:55:59,931 --> 00:56:01,057
Thank you.

515
00:56:01,366 --> 00:56:03,596
Wow!
- Wow! - Great!

516
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:04,861
- One more, please!

517
00:56:04,936 --> 00:56:06,836
Don't go!

518
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:10,534
One more verse!

519
00:56:21,019 --> 00:56:23,715
My next verse..
- Yes, please.

520
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,915
A day shall dawn..

521
00:56:29,828 --> 00:56:31,523
.. bringing with it a calm..

522
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:36,595
.. the heart bereft of desires,
the mind devoid of passion..

523
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:43,472
''Shoreless, totally fathomless''

524
00:56:45,811 --> 00:56:48,803
''Close your eyes, please''

525
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:54,582
''I have been drowning''

526
00:56:56,488 --> 00:56:59,457
''I need to breathe''

527
00:57:01,727 --> 00:57:06,926
''Shoreless, totally fathomless,
Close your eyes, please''

528
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:12,669
''I have been drowning,
I need to breathe''

529
00:57:13,271 --> 00:57:15,364
''Lillah!''

530
00:57:15,774 --> 00:57:21,303
''Turn your face away from me''

531
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:26,345
''It'll be a great kindness''

532
00:57:26,585 --> 00:57:31,852
''Turn your face away from me''

533
00:57:32,457 --> 00:57:36,655
''It'll be a great kindness''

534
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:43,757
''Ever since I have seen you''

535
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:47,771
''My breath's stuck''

536
00:57:47,906 --> 00:57:54,402
''Ever since I have seen you''

537
00:57:54,579 --> 00:57:59,278
''My breath's stuck''

538
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:02,650
''Shoreless, totally fathomless''

539
00:58:04,489 --> 00:58:08,357
''Close your eyes, please''

540
00:58:09,761 --> 00:58:14,289
''I have been drowning''

541
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,733
''I need to breathe''

542
00:58:21,273 --> 00:58:22,831
May I?
- Proceed.

543
00:58:24,776 --> 00:58:28,712
If a flitting glance of yours,
were to graze me

544
00:58:29,681 --> 00:58:30,943
That would be greeting enough..

545
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:34,314
.. and I'll keep my
eyes forever lowered.

546
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,251
Wow!

547
00:58:37,756 --> 00:58:41,590
Ever since I have seen you

548
00:58:41,993 --> 00:58:43,290
My breath is..

549
00:58:46,965 --> 00:58:49,433
Stuck!
- Brilliant!

550
00:58:49,601 --> 00:58:51,592
Mukarrar!

551
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:52,762
Who is that?

552
00:58:54,873 --> 00:58:55,931
Your uncle!

553
00:58:56,007 --> 00:59:00,341
''Pray, take a look''

554
00:59:01,313 --> 00:59:05,340
''At your feet''

555
00:59:06,618 --> 00:59:10,611
''Something's stuck, it seems''

556
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:16,318
''Please ask Time to move on''

557
00:59:17,329 --> 00:59:21,288
''If a flitting glance of yours''

558
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:27,402
''Were to graze me''

559
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:31,570
''That would be greeting enough..''

560
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:36,813
''.. And I'll keep my
eyes forever lowered''

561
00:59:36,882 --> 00:59:38,713
''At your feet''

562
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:45,279
''Ever since I have seen you''

563
00:59:45,523 --> 00:59:50,984
''My breath's stuck''

564
00:59:51,429 --> 00:59:53,829
''Shoreless, totally fathomless''

565
00:59:53,999 --> 00:59:56,593
''Close your eyes, please''

566
00:59:56,735 --> 00:59:59,260
''I have been drowning''

567
00:59:59,437 --> 01:00:02,372
''I need to breathe''

568
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:04,740
''Lillah!''

569
01:00:23,762 --> 01:00:27,823
Tender and romantic in his poetry..

570
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,994
.. bastard in bed.

571
01:00:37,042 --> 01:00:40,808
Unless he beat the
shit out of the woman..

572
01:00:41,046 --> 01:00:42,707
he remained impotent.

573
01:00:58,997 --> 01:01:00,328
Come on..

574
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,468
Come on, bit me.

575
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,338
Come on, bit me.

576
01:01:12,444 --> 01:01:14,275
I like it.

577
01:01:18,016 --> 01:01:19,415
It's great fun.

578
01:02:11,369 --> 01:02:15,965
Initially she tried hard
to conceal her scars..

579
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:20,408
.. but her wounds grew deeper.

580
01:02:22,047 --> 01:02:25,483
Love became a myth.

581
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:27,543
Like a mirage.

582
01:02:28,386 --> 01:02:32,482
You think it's there,
but it really isn't.

583
01:02:33,725 --> 01:02:37,821
Prayers, offerings and sacrifices,
she tried it all.

584
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:39,863
But nothing worked.

585
01:04:17,829 --> 01:04:21,321
Is it coming from
the heart or the being?

586
01:05:06,978 --> 01:05:09,879
These fumes, from
where do they come?

587
01:05:49,921 --> 01:05:53,516
Love is a heavy stone..

588
01:05:57,395 --> 01:06:00,023
Not for the weak ones.

589
01:06:05,403 --> 01:06:06,597
What does 'Natawan' mean?

590
01:06:25,456 --> 01:06:26,616
''Debilitated.''

591
01:06:33,398 --> 01:06:34,490
Weak..

592
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:45,634
Feeble.

593
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,532
Sultana!

594
01:07:57,515 --> 01:07:58,948
Sultana!

595
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:04,247
Cold-blooded!

596
01:09:05,716 --> 01:09:06,876
Why kill someone?

597
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,914
She could've left him and come home.

598
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:13,648
Who would've stopped her?

599
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:18,224
As a child, Miss
''Saheb'' would walk to school.

600
01:09:19,497 --> 01:09:20,930
There were two paths.

601
01:09:21,999 --> 01:09:23,364
Both equidistant.

602
01:09:24,669 --> 01:09:26,762
No difference at all.

603
01:09:28,773 --> 01:09:33,972
And one day, there came a crazy dog,

604
01:09:35,513 --> 01:09:37,378
Who scared her every single day.

605
01:09:51,762 --> 01:09:54,253
She could've taken the other path.

606
01:09:56,601 --> 01:10:02,562
She hid her father's
Mouser in her bag..

607
01:10:03,374 --> 01:10:05,342
And bang!

608
01:10:09,514 --> 01:10:13,848
''Saheb'' always gets her way..

609
01:10:15,386 --> 01:10:18,981
And the dogs are blown off!

610
01:11:03,448 --> 01:11:06,884
Ladies and gentlemen,
to present the trophy..

611
01:11:07,452 --> 01:11:12,014
may I now call on stage, our
esteemed guest of honour..

612
01:11:12,357 --> 01:11:14,689
Mr. Nikolai Vronsky.

613
01:11:14,759 --> 01:11:18,718
Science-attaché to the
Russian consulate, Sir.

614
01:11:23,935 --> 01:11:25,368
Thank you, sir.

615
01:11:27,739 --> 01:11:29,366
Greetings!

616
01:11:30,475 --> 01:11:35,538
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to
handover this wonderful trophy..

617
01:11:35,747 --> 01:11:38,307
to the winner, but before I do so..

618
01:11:39,384 --> 01:11:41,682
I really would like to
share something with you.

619
01:11:42,353 --> 01:11:44,844
I did bet on this particular horse..

620
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:47,351
and I won a fortune.

621
01:11:51,896 --> 01:11:53,989
I need to say thank you very much.

622
01:11:55,967 --> 01:11:58,026
I'm grateful to you.

623
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:00,701
I am Vronsky..

624
01:12:00,905 --> 01:12:02,395
Nikolai Vronsky.

625
01:12:02,707 --> 01:12:04,402
Then I must be Anna!

626
01:12:08,946 --> 01:12:11,471
Anna Karenina is my
favorite character.

627
01:12:12,350 --> 01:12:15,945
I've read the novel, I
don't know.. so many times.

628
01:12:16,788 --> 01:12:19,985
In Hindi.. please.

629
01:12:20,992 --> 01:12:22,687
I'm learning the language.

630
01:12:29,667 --> 01:12:34,434
What else have you picked up?

631
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,564
Okay!

632
01:12:43,047 --> 01:12:48,041
My love for you is eternal.

633
01:12:52,690 --> 01:12:53,884
Let's go, Saheb.

634
01:12:54,759 --> 01:12:58,695
Mr. Vronsky, have you
met my pal here, Arun.

635
01:12:58,963 --> 01:13:01,659
- Is that your full name?
- Yes! Arun.. Arun Kumar.

636
01:13:03,701 --> 01:13:04,793
Anna..

637
01:13:04,869 --> 01:13:06,427
- Anna? - Hold on!

638
01:13:10,741 --> 01:13:16,839
Please have dinner with me..

639
01:13:17,315 --> 01:13:19,715
.. at a nice restaurant today.

640
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:23,987
I am very rich.

641
01:13:26,724 --> 01:13:28,385
I'm sorry, what?

642
01:13:30,361 --> 01:13:31,658
I mean to say that..

643
01:13:31,696 --> 01:13:34,358
I really would like to
spend this play money on..

644
01:13:35,299 --> 01:13:37,597
.. a nice dinner, somewhere?

645
01:13:38,302 --> 01:13:39,894
Would you please do it to me?

646
01:13:42,473 --> 01:13:45,806
I'm sorry, Mr. Vronsky, I
have a prior engagement.

647
01:13:48,412 --> 01:13:50,903
I do definitely understand that,
but can I at least..

648
01:13:50,982 --> 01:13:52,313
Anna!

649
01:13:56,687 --> 01:14:01,351
Can I at least drop
you to.. your mansion?

650
01:14:01,926 --> 01:14:03,052
Please!

651
01:14:03,728 --> 01:14:07,425
I have my car.

652
01:14:10,668 --> 01:14:12,829
But I have
something better, a mother.

653
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:19,007
Amitabh Bachchan.
From the movie, Deewar.

654
01:14:20,011 --> 01:14:21,478
It's destiny.

655
01:14:22,246 --> 01:14:23,372
What?

656
01:15:02,019 --> 01:15:03,486
From now on..

657
01:15:04,355 --> 01:15:07,654
no English, no Campa Cola.

658
01:15:07,959 --> 01:15:11,486
Only Russian and Vodka.

659
01:15:14,899 --> 01:15:18,892
Russia and me.. why?

660
01:15:19,737 --> 01:15:23,537
Because you my friend,
are headed to Russia.

661
01:15:23,874 --> 01:15:27,366
To study at St.
Petersburg Medical Academy.

662
01:15:27,445 --> 01:15:29,777
Cheers!

663
01:15:31,515 --> 01:15:32,675
Why?

664
01:15:35,686 --> 01:15:38,883
Because, Nik loves me..

665
01:15:39,724 --> 01:15:42,784
and I love you, my little sugar.

666
01:15:51,268 --> 01:15:52,394
Nik!

667
01:15:54,705 --> 01:15:56,639
To hell I'm going to Russia!

668
01:15:59,744 --> 01:16:00,870
Why not?

669
01:16:02,446 --> 01:16:05,381
Because, I hate vodka.

670
01:16:11,055 --> 01:16:12,886
It's because..

671
01:16:15,559 --> 01:16:18,790
.. you are jealous of the Russians.

672
01:16:59,704 --> 01:17:02,798
Quiet a distance he has walked

673
01:17:03,607 --> 01:17:06,599
A thousand distant miles

674
01:17:07,344 --> 01:17:13,749
Another Pushkin from Russia

675
01:17:14,752 --> 01:17:20,952
Who's left Moscow only
to be with me

676
01:17:21,726 --> 01:17:27,995
Something like this is
possible only in love

677
01:17:28,265 --> 01:17:30,290
Darling

678
01:17:30,468 --> 01:17:33,494
Let your eyes feast on mine

679
01:17:33,571 --> 01:17:37,405
Darling let the passion rush

680
01:17:37,475 --> 01:17:41,343
Don't hold it back
let this love gush

681
01:17:41,412 --> 01:17:45,246
Darling let your eyes feast on mine

682
01:17:45,316 --> 01:17:49,275
Don't hold it back
let this love gush

683
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:51,354
The Spring's joyless

684
01:17:51,422 --> 01:17:52,946
The beloved's heart's restless

685
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:56,789
Hold back the songbirds

686
01:17:56,861 --> 01:18:01,298
Darling let your eyes feast on mine

687
01:18:18,816 --> 01:18:19,976
Anna?

688
01:18:21,318 --> 01:18:28,247
That hillock enveloped in mist

689
01:18:28,459 --> 01:18:35,262
Where the fairies once lived

690
01:18:35,733 --> 01:18:42,571
You'll find it
across the high Khyber

691
01:18:42,907 --> 01:18:49,471
That's what all
the fairies still say

692
01:18:49,547 --> 01:18:51,572
Darling

693
01:18:51,649 --> 01:18:55,676
I'm merely a serf, let
me groom the Princess

694
01:18:55,753 --> 01:18:59,655
Let this restless
heart steal a little solace

695
01:18:59,723 --> 01:19:03,523
Let me conquer the
heart of my beloved

696
01:19:03,594 --> 01:19:07,655
Darling let your eyes feast on mine

697
01:19:07,698 --> 01:19:09,598
The Spring's joyless

698
01:19:09,667 --> 01:19:11,396
The beloved's heart's restless

699
01:19:11,468 --> 01:19:15,268
Hold back the songbirds

700
01:19:15,339 --> 01:19:18,968
Darling let your eyes feast on mine

701
01:19:19,043 --> 01:19:22,672
Don't hold it back
let this love gush

702
01:19:22,746 --> 01:19:26,238
Darling let your eyes feast on mine

703
01:19:26,317 --> 01:19:29,548
Don't hold it back
let this love gush

704
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:33,886
Darling let your eyes feast on mine

705
01:20:20,738 --> 01:20:22,000
Honey..

706
01:20:22,973 --> 01:20:24,531
Good evening, darling!

707
01:20:24,909 --> 01:20:26,774
Did you have to leave
all the guests alone..

708
01:20:27,411 --> 01:20:28,673
by themselves?

709
01:20:31,048 --> 01:20:32,572
Come on back in.

710
01:20:33,984 --> 01:20:35,975
Who were you talking to, Nik?

711
01:20:37,922 --> 01:20:41,289
A colleague, from Moscow.

712
01:20:43,861 --> 01:20:45,385
Woman?

713
01:20:48,332 --> 01:20:50,061
Oh you're so jealous!

714
01:20:50,734 --> 01:20:52,668
Look at me. So jealous!

715
01:20:54,405 --> 01:20:55,736
What do you think?

716
01:20:59,376 --> 01:21:02,504
Your last words of the
conversation meant..

717
01:21:03,647 --> 01:21:06,480
'Darling, I will be back soon.'

718
01:21:12,556 --> 01:21:14,649
Your Russian is so bad.

719
01:21:17,528 --> 01:21:20,429
Shall we just go in,
please? Come on.

720
01:21:21,832 --> 01:21:23,993
You are hiding
something from me, Nik.

721
01:21:25,636 --> 01:21:26,796
No!

722
01:21:27,771 --> 01:21:29,033
Sure?

723
01:21:32,309 --> 01:21:33,503
No.

724
01:21:37,681 --> 01:21:43,483
When I say I go to Kanyakumari..

725
01:21:47,358 --> 01:21:51,761
I don't go to Kanyakumari.

726
01:21:55,766 --> 01:21:58,428
I go to Koodankulam, instead.

727
01:22:03,741 --> 01:22:04,867
Koodankulam?

728
01:22:06,910 --> 01:22:08,036
Yes, Koodankulam.

729
01:22:11,515 --> 01:22:13,710
Koodankulam Nuclear Power project.

730
01:22:16,954 --> 01:22:20,446
Honey, we're helping
your government to..

731
01:22:21,425 --> 01:22:24,588
set up the light water
reactor technology in India.

732
01:22:28,766 --> 01:22:29,824
Excuse me?

733
01:22:32,803 --> 01:22:33,861
What's that supposed to mean?

734
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:42,776
It means your country, is going to
become one of the self sufficient..

735
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,045
nuclear states.

736
01:22:47,851 --> 01:22:49,045
Nik.

737
01:22:52,556 --> 01:22:53,853
You are a spy?

738
01:22:55,959 --> 01:22:57,051
Come on!

739
01:23:03,967 --> 01:23:05,434
No.

740
01:23:10,707 --> 01:23:11,765
No!

741
01:23:14,878 --> 01:23:16,311
I am your friend.

742
01:23:17,714 --> 01:23:18,942
And..

743
01:23:21,618 --> 01:23:25,782
my love for you is eternal.

744
01:23:36,834 --> 01:23:38,301
A kilo of this, please.

745
01:23:39,603 --> 01:23:41,969
I'm just not ready
for another marriage.

746
01:23:46,410 --> 01:23:47,468
Why not?

747
01:23:48,879 --> 01:23:52,610
Marriage is the worst
thing that happened to mankind.

748
01:23:54,852 --> 01:23:56,547
And in any case..

749
01:23:56,620 --> 01:24:00,613
I want to remain in love, you know.

750
01:24:02,359 --> 01:24:03,485
Me too.

751
01:24:04,995 --> 01:24:06,553
But you know I..

752
01:24:09,466 --> 01:24:11,457
I can't stay for long with you.

753
01:24:15,672 --> 01:24:17,299
Unless I marry you.

754
01:24:19,510 --> 01:24:22,911
Why? Marriage why?

755
01:24:23,981 --> 01:24:25,505
Because..

756
01:24:27,284 --> 01:24:32,312
I'm pregnant..

757
01:24:33,423 --> 01:24:36,017
.. with your child.

758
01:24:38,495 --> 01:24:39,655
A shocking incident..

759
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:42,358
India had finally
accomplished its nuclear test.

760
01:24:43,867 --> 01:24:46,495
And instead of Hiroshima,
it was now, my heart!

761
01:24:48,438 --> 01:24:50,838
Saheb dropped two bombs.

762
01:24:51,375 --> 01:24:53,275
First.. to get married!

763
01:24:57,748 --> 01:25:00,615
The other, to send me to Russia.

764
01:25:28,278 --> 01:25:30,439
It was my fault.

765
01:25:31,848 --> 01:25:34,282
I should've kept mum.

766
01:25:36,353 --> 01:25:38,787
I made a trip to Moscow to
attend a college seminar.

767
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:42,754
And what I saw there..

768
01:25:43,427 --> 01:25:45,691
blew my mind.

769
01:25:49,866 --> 01:25:53,324
Nikolai Vronsky, in fact had..

770
01:25:53,403 --> 01:25:54,700
two Anna's.

771
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:59,636
One in India and
the other in Moscow.

772
01:26:03,313 --> 01:26:06,612
I still blame myself for his death.

773
01:26:07,484 --> 01:26:09,975
I shouldn't have
sent her those pictures.

774
01:26:15,993 --> 01:26:17,460
Hi guys!

775
01:26:17,561 --> 01:26:19,028
So great to be back.

776
01:26:20,731 --> 01:26:21,755
Where's Anna?

777
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:27,294
She's at the market.

778
01:26:27,771 --> 01:26:30,365
- But why? - For
her new wedding gown.

779
01:26:45,822 --> 01:26:47,687
Goonga! Greatjob.

780
01:26:48,659 --> 01:26:49,956
Lovely!

781
01:26:51,261 --> 01:26:52,694
Feels so good.

782
01:26:54,331 --> 01:26:56,390
The late Major..

783
01:26:57,968 --> 01:26:59,401
her first husband.

784
01:27:01,772 --> 01:27:03,296
Very brave, sir!

785
01:27:05,375 --> 01:27:08,867
He was eaten by a panther,
wasn't he?

786
01:27:11,982 --> 01:27:13,472
Shut up Goonga!

787
01:27:14,985 --> 01:27:16,282
What did he say?

788
01:27:16,353 --> 01:27:18,821
He says we pushed the Major down..

789
01:27:19,623 --> 01:27:20,749
and then the panther ate him.

790
01:27:23,927 --> 01:27:26,327
Don't believe him, sir.

791
01:27:26,596 --> 01:27:28,496
He is a big liar.

792
01:27:30,767 --> 01:27:33,827
Husband number two, Jimmy.

793
01:27:34,671 --> 01:27:36,229
Very good song, sir!

794
01:27:44,881 --> 01:27:46,348
Goonga, shut the hell up.

795
01:27:47,918 --> 01:27:50,546
Why are you telling me all this?

796
01:27:50,754 --> 01:27:53,279
Because he too, had a mother.

797
01:27:53,523 --> 01:27:55,286
No, not at all.

798
01:27:55,759 --> 01:27:58,523
Don't believe them,
they are just lying!

799
01:27:59,563 --> 01:28:06,366
They say, that we gave
him an overdose of heroin..

800
01:28:08,672 --> 01:28:12,039
then we dragged him to the cemetery.

801
01:28:17,547 --> 01:28:19,481
Husband number three..

802
01:28:20,751 --> 01:28:25,313
Wasiullah Khan a.k. a The Traveller!

803
01:28:25,722 --> 01:28:27,986
We dug his grave in the snow..

804
01:28:28,792 --> 01:28:32,523
and buried him alive.

805
01:28:39,870 --> 01:28:41,701
Good sense of humour guys!

806
01:28:45,942 --> 01:28:47,375
Where is Anna?

807
01:28:51,415 --> 01:28:53,940
Anna is over here!

808
01:28:54,584 --> 01:28:55,778
Look!

809
01:28:55,852 --> 01:28:58,377
Anna's here!

810
01:29:00,724 --> 01:29:03,887
And that is you..

811
01:29:04,728 --> 01:29:06,992
Nikolai Vronsky!

812
01:29:07,697 --> 01:29:11,929
My husband number four..

813
01:29:12,769 --> 01:29:16,603
with his wife number two.

814
01:29:18,375 --> 01:29:20,900
Cheers to that!

815
01:29:20,977 --> 01:29:27,405
Four, four..

816
01:29:27,484 --> 01:29:29,213
Where the hell did
you get this from?

817
01:29:30,353 --> 01:29:31,513
R. A. W.

818
01:29:31,588 --> 01:29:33,488
I'm asking you, who gave it to you!

819
01:29:33,723 --> 01:29:37,819
R. A. W..

820
01:29:37,894 --> 01:29:41,853
Anna, I was on a mission,
we were following a CIA man.

821
01:29:45,702 --> 01:29:46,964
It's part of my job.

822
01:29:47,471 --> 01:29:49,701
- It's part of my job,
you understand? - What!

823
01:29:49,773 --> 01:29:52,674
To have a wife in every country?

824
01:29:53,477 --> 01:29:55,809
A wife in every country!

825
01:29:55,879 --> 01:29:59,246
Darling let your eyes feast on mine

826
01:29:59,316 --> 01:30:00,840
Darling let your eyes feast on mine

827
01:30:00,884 --> 01:30:02,476
Give it to me, it's mine.

828
01:30:03,687 --> 01:30:04,847
Just give it to me.

829
01:30:05,589 --> 01:30:07,887
Run away! Run fast..

830
01:30:11,795 --> 01:30:13,387
He ran away!

831
01:30:15,899 --> 01:30:17,423
It's a mad house!

832
01:30:17,501 --> 01:30:19,025
It's a mad house, you know!

833
01:30:19,569 --> 01:30:20,831
You're crazy!

834
01:30:21,438 --> 01:30:22,598
Come on, honey.

835
01:30:22,873 --> 01:30:24,340
Come on, listen to me.

836
01:30:24,608 --> 01:30:25,973
She is not my wife.

837
01:30:27,677 --> 01:30:28,905
She is my colleague..

838
01:30:29,813 --> 01:30:31,007
.. an agent.

839
01:30:32,682 --> 01:30:36,049
And you.. a double agent!

840
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:40,556
Believe me.. we were just
acting like husband and wife.

841
01:30:42,959 --> 01:30:47,987
I know you can play
a very good husband!

842
01:30:52,602 --> 01:30:56,629
But to play such a great daddy.

843
01:30:58,642 --> 01:31:00,371
No chance!

844
01:31:05,682 --> 01:31:07,445
You're so wrong, Anna.

845
01:31:08,518 --> 01:31:09,746
You're so wrong.

846
01:31:18,728 --> 01:31:20,025
Always!

847
01:31:45,021 --> 01:31:46,716
I'll quit the job, honey.

848
01:31:47,791 --> 01:31:49,383
And I'll be back for you.

849
01:31:51,394 --> 01:31:52,656
Forever!

850
01:31:57,867 --> 01:31:59,892
My love for you is eternal.

851
01:32:25,629 --> 01:32:27,790
Come on, you've been called.

852
01:32:39,442 --> 01:32:40,500
Sir!

853
01:32:46,449 --> 01:32:47,711
Have a seat, please.

854
01:32:55,859 --> 01:32:58,521
How're you doing, Madame?

855
01:33:01,665 --> 01:33:04,600
- It's you.. - Yes,
it's me.. Keemat.

856
01:33:06,369 --> 01:33:08,599
Inspector Keemat Lal!

857
01:33:09,839 --> 01:33:14,401
Officer Keemat Lal,
Intelligence Bureau.

858
01:33:16,413 --> 01:33:18,438
This time, you're in real trouble.

859
01:33:20,316 --> 01:33:22,546
- Look, Mr. Keemat..
-No 'Mr.' please..

860
01:33:22,952 --> 01:33:24,749
Just Keemat.

861
01:33:25,455 --> 01:33:27,446
I've gone through all your reports.

862
01:33:28,725 --> 01:33:33,628
The local police is
convinced about your involvement.

863
01:33:36,299 --> 01:33:38,995
According to them it's a
clear cut case of murder.

864
01:33:40,437 --> 01:33:43,372
But the case is sensitive.

865
01:33:44,007 --> 01:33:47,773
The Ministry of external affairs,
Russian embassy, are all involved..

866
01:33:49,646 --> 01:33:51,807
You are an intelligent woman.

867
01:33:54,017 --> 01:33:55,507
But, this time..

868
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:07,792
there is a certain item missing
from your husband's belongings.

869
01:34:13,369 --> 01:34:18,466
If only I could get
my hands on that..

870
01:34:22,912 --> 01:34:24,607
you get it?

871
01:34:35,325 --> 01:34:36,587
Trust me.

872
01:35:04,287 --> 01:35:07,279
That's it! Just
leave the rest to me.

873
01:35:08,391 --> 01:35:09,688
Great!

874
01:35:13,897 --> 01:35:19,563
By the way, what are you
doing this evening? Must be busy.

875
01:35:19,803 --> 01:35:22,738
I need to inspect
the scene of the crime.

876
01:35:24,908 --> 01:35:28,674
Maybe, some other time then..

877
01:35:32,382 --> 01:35:34,282
Do you prefer
vegetarian or non vegetarian?

878
01:35:37,287 --> 01:35:38,652
Don't bother..

879
01:35:39,823 --> 01:35:41,552
non vegetarian.

880
01:35:44,828 --> 01:35:48,423
And what would you prefer to drink?

881
01:35:52,569 --> 01:35:54,400
Nothing in particular..

882
01:35:57,841 --> 01:35:59,433
What do you prefer?

883
01:36:01,578 --> 01:36:04,411
Anything but vodka.

884
01:36:08,651 --> 01:36:11,586
You're going to get
me killed, Madame.

885
01:36:13,456 --> 01:36:15,981
Sorry.. Sunaina.

886
01:36:23,433 --> 01:36:24,593
Wow!

887
01:36:28,671 --> 01:36:31,697
I think I've had a
bit too much to drink.

888
01:36:34,944 --> 01:36:36,434
Never mind..

889
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:39,746
you'll sweat it out.

890
01:36:41,384 --> 01:36:42,476
Where?

891
01:36:42,785 --> 01:36:45,811
At the scene of the crime.

892
01:36:54,697 --> 01:36:56,562
It is pretty deep.

893
01:36:58,301 --> 01:37:01,828
In the dark anyone
could miss his step.

894
01:37:04,941 --> 01:37:07,705
It was a full moon night.

895
01:37:10,513 --> 01:37:11,946
Mind you, he didn't slip.

896
01:37:13,383 --> 01:37:14,680
He climbed down..

897
01:37:15,518 --> 01:37:16,883
on his own.

898
01:37:22,392 --> 01:37:25,623
Must've been slippery
because of the rain..

899
01:37:27,730 --> 01:37:32,360
.. and moss.

900
01:37:33,836 --> 01:37:35,269
The rain?

901
01:37:35,672 --> 01:37:37,264
In this season?

902
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:53,814
A lot of accidents can
happen when one is drunk.

903
01:37:58,695 --> 01:38:00,629
He had quit drinking.

904
01:38:11,808 --> 01:38:13,275
Alcohol!

905
01:38:16,312 --> 01:38:21,477
How do I..

906
01:38:22,518 --> 01:38:23,849
What should I say?

907
01:38:28,291 --> 01:38:29,519
Forget about it.

908
01:38:32,962 --> 01:38:34,395
Sorry?

909
01:38:39,369 --> 01:38:40,597
Madame!

910
01:38:44,273 --> 01:38:45,535
Darkness!

911
01:38:46,376 --> 01:38:49,004
Pitch black!

912
01:38:49,712 --> 01:38:54,775
Raining..

913
01:38:55,785 --> 01:38:58,913
cats and dogs!

914
01:38:59,422 --> 01:39:00,616
And..

915
01:39:05,294 --> 01:39:09,924
the white man slipped.

916
01:39:10,566 --> 01:39:11,794
Died!

917
01:39:12,335 --> 01:39:14,826
Reached hell. The
bastard deserved it!

918
01:39:16,939 --> 01:39:18,497
Madame!

919
01:39:48,471 --> 01:39:51,269
I'll never forget this favour.

920
01:39:53,376 --> 01:39:55,571
'Pure satisfaction.'

921
01:39:57,513 --> 01:40:00,607
Like I've bathed a hundred
times in the holy waters.

922
01:40:02,919 --> 01:40:04,716
No need to worry anymore.

923
01:40:06,856 --> 01:40:08,687
If you ever come to Delhi..

924
01:40:09,692 --> 01:40:11,455
I'd like to return the favour.

925
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:18,760
Should I go?

926
01:40:19,802 --> 01:40:20,962
Yes!

927
01:40:32,281 --> 01:40:36,047
Keemat left, only to return sooner.

928
01:40:37,587 --> 01:40:39,578
He definitely reached Delhi..

929
01:40:39,655 --> 01:40:42,624
but left his heart behind.

930
01:40:43,059 --> 01:40:46,324
He'd come back for it everytime..

931
01:40:46,395 --> 01:40:48,829
but always managed
to leave it behind.

932
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:52,033
Come Madame.

933
01:40:52,301 --> 01:40:53,598
Come.

934
01:41:39,982 --> 01:41:43,611
But Keemat kept on coming.

935
01:41:44,754 --> 01:41:47,416
Saheb was left with no other option.

936
01:41:51,894 --> 01:41:57,389
His quest for 'pure
satisfaction' knew no end.

937
01:42:07,910 --> 01:42:13,712
I confessed to my wife.

938
01:42:16,953 --> 01:42:18,318
Why?

939
01:42:22,258 --> 01:42:23,987
I wanted a divorce.

940
01:42:30,833 --> 01:42:32,460
And I got it too!

941
01:42:33,703 --> 01:42:34,931
Here, look!

942
01:42:41,644 --> 01:42:44,943
I can't live without you anymore.

943
01:42:46,482 --> 01:42:49,508
I'd rather die.

944
01:42:49,852 --> 01:42:51,513
I will die.

945
01:42:55,424 --> 01:42:58,416
I swear on the Lord himself!

946
01:43:05,835 --> 01:43:08,531
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son..

947
01:43:08,604 --> 01:43:10,936
..and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

948
01:43:11,707 --> 01:43:14,574
Since it is your intention
to enter into marriage..

949
01:43:14,777 --> 01:43:17,541
join your right hands and
declare your consent..

950
01:43:17,613 --> 01:43:18,671
..before God and his church.

951
01:43:22,818 --> 01:43:28,347
I Keemat Lal, take you Susanna
Anna Marie Johannes, to be my wife.

952
01:43:28,591 --> 01:43:32,493
I promise to be true to
you in good times and in bad,

953
01:43:32,528 --> 01:43:34,587
in sickness and in health.

954
01:43:34,664 --> 01:43:38,657
I will love you and honour you,
all the days of my life,

955
01:43:38,734 --> 01:43:40,895
till death do us apart.

956
01:43:41,604 --> 01:43:45,734
I Susanna Anna Marie Johannes, take
you Keemat Lal to be my husband.

957
01:43:45,941 --> 01:43:49,308
I promise to be true to
you in good times and in bad,

958
01:43:49,512 --> 01:43:51,036
in sickness and in health.

959
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:52,813
I will love you and honour you.

960
01:43:52,882 --> 01:43:56,579
.. all the days of my life,
till death do us apart.

961
01:44:55,811 --> 01:44:58,712
Oh my God. There was
poison in the Viagra bottle?

962
01:44:59,682 --> 01:45:01,809
The bottle contained Viagra pills.

963
01:45:02,685 --> 01:45:03,947
What was it then?

964
01:45:05,721 --> 01:45:07,279
Overdose?

965
01:45:07,656 --> 01:45:11,490
Leading to a massive heart attack.
Very unfortunate!

966
01:45:12,762 --> 01:45:14,354
Terrible accident!

967
01:45:14,597 --> 01:45:17,930
Accident? She killed him.
And you knew it.

968
01:45:18,334 --> 01:45:19,892
How would I know?

969
01:45:20,369 --> 01:45:23,566
Of course, you wouldn't.
You were blinded by her love.

970
01:45:26,475 --> 01:45:30,673
Some years later, I
returned from Russia, a Doctor.

971
01:45:31,847 --> 01:45:36,375
But Saheb had
turned into 'a patient.'

972
01:45:36,886 --> 01:45:38,979
My.. my.

973
01:45:40,990 --> 01:45:42,457
Look at you!

974
01:45:45,361 --> 01:45:48,853
What has the world
done to my little bunny!

975
01:45:55,004 --> 01:45:56,801
Happy New Year, Saheb

976
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:09,040
What are you looking for?

977
01:46:12,054 --> 01:46:13,817
I know there's one..

978
01:46:14,957 --> 01:46:16,288
hiding somewhere.

979
01:46:19,428 --> 01:46:24,388
I just can't seem to find
the rascal, when I want.

980
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:25,928
White hair?

981
01:46:28,771 --> 01:46:30,261
Don't say it aloud.

982
01:46:31,507 --> 01:46:32,997
It's a bad omen.

983
01:46:41,550 --> 01:46:42,812
Here it is.

984
01:46:42,852 --> 01:46:45,719
Show it. Let me see!

985
01:46:47,756 --> 01:46:49,451
Fetch the scissors..

986
01:46:49,525 --> 01:46:51,254
there on the record.

987
01:46:58,567 --> 01:46:59,829
Snip it at the root.

988
01:47:08,744 --> 01:47:09,870
See..

989
01:47:10,813 --> 01:47:12,940
how much I need you.

990
01:47:17,319 --> 01:47:20,618
Right there.. put it in the box.

991
01:47:27,563 --> 01:47:31,329
I hate New Year's Eve.

992
01:47:37,273 --> 01:47:39,264
When did you see me last?

993
01:47:41,477 --> 01:47:42,808
It's been two years.

994
01:47:46,849 --> 01:47:48,373
Do I look any different?

995
01:47:53,656 --> 01:47:56,989
You've become a
little more beautiful.

996
01:48:11,006 --> 01:48:12,633
I haven't changed at all?

997
01:48:26,655 --> 01:48:27,849
Sure?

998
01:48:35,898 --> 01:48:37,991
You've grown up to be shy.

999
01:48:48,711 --> 01:48:50,440
Please don't, Saheb

1000
01:48:50,512 --> 01:48:51,706
Why not?

1001
01:48:53,449 --> 01:48:56,247
It's my
responsibility to educate you.

1002
01:49:25,848 --> 01:49:30,979
The delicate thread
between us had snapped.

1003
01:49:32,821 --> 01:49:36,723
That was the last time,
I ever saw her.

1004
01:49:40,429 --> 01:49:41,623
The next morning..

1005
01:49:41,697 --> 01:49:46,691
I took Goonga along
and left her forever.

1006
01:50:02,584 --> 01:50:07,920
The secondary post mortem reports,
and facial superimpositions..

1007
01:50:08,457 --> 01:50:11,551
as well as the PCR tests,
clearly indicate that..

1008
01:50:12,695 --> 01:50:13,787
the samples match.

1009
01:50:15,931 --> 01:50:19,423
Hence, it is proven that..

1010
01:50:21,370 --> 01:50:22,701
she is dead.

1011
01:50:23,972 --> 01:50:25,496
Thank God!

1012
01:50:25,774 --> 01:50:28,868
No one to fear, and no
favours to be returned.

1013
01:50:33,816 --> 01:50:35,408
You still miss her, right?

1014
01:50:35,651 --> 01:50:36,777
No.

1015
01:50:38,053 --> 01:50:39,350
Liar.

1016
01:50:40,522 --> 01:50:42,752
Get some sleep. It's pretty late.

1017
01:50:43,926 --> 01:50:46,520
It's an early morning flight
and you need to be in time..

1018
01:50:46,595 --> 01:50:48,654
..for security check.

1019
01:50:54,937 --> 01:50:57,599
And just don't let me
catch you dreaming about her.

1020
01:52:48,617 --> 01:52:49,982
Hello!

1021
01:52:50,619 --> 01:52:53,850
Yes, can I speak to Mr.
Arun Kumar, please?

1022
01:52:58,861 --> 01:53:00,328
Sorry?

1023
01:53:03,999 --> 01:53:05,899
No, can you check again, please?

1024
01:53:05,968 --> 01:53:09,563
He should have arrived last night,
with the Criminal Forensics Group.

1025
01:53:10,339 --> 01:53:11,533
Yeah.

1026
01:53:16,445 --> 01:53:18,572
Okay.. no, thanks.

1027
01:53:25,287 --> 01:53:28,381
Come on, Nandi. Get a grip.

1028
01:53:29,925 --> 01:53:31,984
It'll be fine. I have a
friend working at Vodafone.

1029
01:53:32,027 --> 01:53:36,760
We'll find out right now,
details about his last call.

1030
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:39,892
Please calm down.

1031
01:53:40,369 --> 01:53:42,428
Here, have some water.

1032
01:53:43,038 --> 01:53:45,506
Mama.. mama.. it's daddy!

1033
01:53:45,574 --> 01:53:47,940
I told him you are very angry.

1034
01:53:48,010 --> 01:53:49,534
Hand me the phone.

1035
01:53:50,379 --> 01:53:52,279
Hello.. hello Arun.

1036
01:53:52,347 --> 01:53:54,577
Arun can you hear me.. hello!

1037
01:53:55,350 --> 01:53:57,284
Hello.. Arun.

1038
01:53:57,452 --> 01:53:58,783
Can you hear me? Hello!

1039
01:53:58,854 --> 01:54:00,048
Hello.

1040
01:54:00,455 --> 01:54:02,286
Hi Nandini.. how are you?

1041
01:54:02,357 --> 01:54:03,847
Where the fuck are you?

1042
01:54:03,926 --> 01:54:07,418
I tried calling you a hundred times.
There is no conference in Delhi.

1043
01:54:08,830 --> 01:54:09,956
Arun!

1044
01:54:10,499 --> 01:54:13,024
Say something for God's
sake Arun. Where are you?

1045
01:54:13,602 --> 01:54:15,467
Nandini, I'm fine wherever I am.

1046
01:54:16,905 --> 01:54:18,532
I'll be back in a day or two.

1047
01:54:21,843 --> 01:54:23,367
Arun, why?

1048
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:26,811
For what?

1049
01:54:28,784 --> 01:54:32,413
Is there someone else in your life?

1050
01:54:34,423 --> 01:54:37,790
I can't believe, you
would betray me for anyone.

1051
01:54:41,463 --> 01:54:42,657
But there is someone.

1052
01:54:44,433 --> 01:54:45,559
Is she alive?

1053
01:54:46,902 --> 01:54:48,267
Arun?

1054
01:54:49,671 --> 01:54:51,036
Is Susanna alive?

1055
01:55:16,832 --> 01:55:21,462
I feel such comfort,
just by looking at you.

1056
01:55:22,270 --> 01:55:24,670
It all comes down
to love, sweetheart!

1057
01:55:26,008 --> 01:55:28,374
Do you need more
time to think over it?

1058
01:55:31,913 --> 01:55:35,474
No. I've already made my decision.

1059
01:55:36,351 --> 01:55:37,682
Alright then.

1060
01:55:38,353 --> 01:55:40,913
See you in the church at 11.

1061
01:56:15,957 --> 01:56:18,289
I've repaid your favours, Saheb

1062
01:56:31,540 --> 01:56:33,565
Your Saheb is no more..

1063
01:56:38,246 --> 01:56:39,406
sugar.

1064
01:56:43,885 --> 01:56:48,413
I kept looking for reasons
to live, after you were gone.

1065
01:56:49,524 --> 01:56:52,254
And one day, I heard
about your wedding.

1066
01:56:52,928 --> 01:56:55,556
What better reason
could I have waited for..

1067
01:56:56,298 --> 01:56:57,595
to end my life.

1068
01:57:14,683 --> 01:57:17,413
Asshole.. I almost ran into you.

1069
01:57:18,353 --> 01:57:21,481
The phone and car,
are both out of order.

1070
01:57:21,890 --> 01:57:24,450
My mistress needs to
get to the hospital.

1071
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:27,690
Please, sir, for God's sake.

1072
01:57:27,996 --> 01:57:31,830
Please help, sir. Please!

1073
01:57:31,900 --> 01:57:34,528
Otherwise my mistress will die.

1074
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:43,539
I was desperate to finally
rest in the arms of Jesus.

1075
01:57:44,446 --> 01:57:46,641
Looks like Jesus changed his mind.

1076
01:57:46,815 --> 01:57:48,442
Last minute hitch.

1077
01:57:48,917 --> 01:57:53,718
Maybe in guilt, he sent me an angel.

1078
01:57:59,261 --> 01:58:01,593
I was dead in my head.

1079
01:58:02,430 --> 01:58:05,593
But when I woke up,
felt a little strange..

1080
01:58:05,967 --> 01:58:08,492
a pair of spectacles on God's nose?

1081
01:58:12,541 --> 01:58:13,633
You are..

1082
01:58:14,042 --> 01:58:15,441
Tarafdar.

1083
01:58:17,345 --> 01:58:20,781
Dr. Modhushudhon Tarafdar.

1084
01:58:21,283 --> 01:58:24,616
Who slowly became the
big brother of the house.

1085
01:58:24,819 --> 01:58:27,583
He was considered some
kind of Miracle Doctor.

1086
01:58:28,423 --> 01:58:30,755
A strange concoction of allopathy,
naturopathy..

1087
01:58:30,825 --> 01:58:33,885
.. ayurveda and spirituality.

1088
01:58:57,018 --> 01:58:59,282
Ridiculous!

1089
01:59:04,559 --> 01:59:08,393
This mushroom is
called Jack O' Lantern.

1090
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:18,836
It has a number of uses.
Very useful mushroom.

1091
01:59:20,475 --> 01:59:26,937
A bit could cure,
too much could kill.

1092
01:59:29,317 --> 01:59:31,444
There is plenty of evil all around.

1093
01:59:32,254 --> 01:59:33,414
Understand?

1094
01:59:34,789 --> 01:59:36,723
There is plenty of evil all around.

1095
01:59:37,425 --> 01:59:40,792
And even plenty is
never really enough..

1096
01:59:42,597 --> 01:59:44,497
it's always scarce.

1097
01:59:47,702 --> 01:59:50,466
But for the one who
survives even in scarcity..

1098
01:59:51,740 --> 01:59:54,470
nothing seems scarce.

1099
01:59:54,909 --> 01:59:58,310
Less, more.. more, less..
that's life.

1100
02:00:02,417 --> 02:00:07,855
So would you prefer
less or more in your soup?

1101
02:00:10,892 --> 02:00:16,762
For a healer like him, I was
willing to remain ill all my life.

1102
02:00:17,666 --> 02:00:24,868
And I would've but Modhu promised,
he wouldn't go back to Calcutta.

1103
02:00:26,041 --> 02:00:28,305
Marriage wasn't on my mind.

1104
02:00:28,677 --> 02:00:33,273
But Modhu wanted me to
be the heir to his wealth.

1105
02:00:33,882 --> 02:00:38,046
He was afraid that if he were
to leave this world before me..

1106
02:00:38,486 --> 02:00:43,890
then his ex-wife and
daughter would harass me.

1107
02:00:55,804 --> 02:00:58,295
My life was grounded..

1108
02:00:58,373 --> 02:01:01,001
but I was flying.

1109
02:01:01,343 --> 02:01:02,469
Modhu.. da.

1110
02:01:05,847 --> 02:01:08,941
What would I do without you!

1111
02:01:09,017 --> 02:01:10,507
Nothing!

1112
02:01:17,692 --> 02:01:19,626
- Come back fast. - Bye bye.

1113
02:01:39,481 --> 02:01:40,812
Khan..

1114
02:01:41,516 --> 02:01:43,381
what happened to the lights?

1115
02:02:00,835 --> 02:02:02,928
Khan.. Maggie aunty!

1116
02:02:04,973 --> 02:02:06,941
There's a robber upstairs.
And he has a knife.

1117
02:02:07,008 --> 02:02:08,532
Be careful!

1118
02:02:28,630 --> 02:02:32,964
News is just in that in
shootout at the Taj hotel..

1119
02:02:33,001 --> 02:02:36,368
NSE Major Sandeep
Unnikrishnan has been killed.

1120
02:02:36,438 --> 02:02:39,305
At the Trident
Oberoi and Nariman House..

1121
02:02:46,481 --> 02:02:48,005
Don't worry!

1122
02:02:48,283 --> 02:02:50,979
Everything will be fine, come..

1123
02:02:51,719 --> 02:02:52,981
come.

1124
02:02:58,793 --> 02:03:00,317
Modhu.

1125
02:03:02,430 --> 02:03:04,660
- Thank you. - Let me see?

1126
02:03:09,003 --> 02:03:10,300
Nice.

1127
02:03:36,264 --> 02:03:40,860
I was destined to be
with all the wrong men.

1128
02:03:44,772 --> 02:03:47,502
At first I was completely shattered!

1129
02:03:47,876 --> 02:03:50,970
But slowly I began to fear him.

1130
02:03:51,513 --> 02:03:54,448
For the first time, it was
my life that was in danger.

1131
02:04:00,488 --> 02:04:04,447
Look what I cooked
especially for you.

1132
02:04:06,995 --> 02:04:08,656
Your favourite!

1133
02:04:09,731 --> 02:04:11,722
Mushroom Veloute.

1134
02:05:31,579 --> 02:05:32,910
Susie!

1135
02:05:33,748 --> 02:05:36,239
Ghalib.. in the kitchen.

1136
02:06:49,791 --> 02:06:53,454
Yellow one, if taken in
large quantity is fatal..

1137
02:06:53,695 --> 02:06:55,253
.. but if you take
it in small quantity..

1138
02:06:55,329 --> 02:06:56,762
it produces hallucinations.

1139
02:06:56,831 --> 02:06:59,356
You know, what they call,
magic mushroom.

1140
02:07:01,502 --> 02:07:02,867
And this..

1141
02:07:09,811 --> 02:07:12,712
How can you think such a thing?
Have you lost it?

1142
02:07:15,483 --> 02:07:17,383
I saved your life.

1143
02:07:18,386 --> 02:07:19,944
Don't you remember?

1144
02:07:22,223 --> 02:07:23,588
Susanna..

1145
02:07:25,960 --> 02:07:28,929
What are you doing?

1146
02:07:31,933 --> 02:07:33,798
What is this, Susanna?

1147
02:07:34,469 --> 02:07:35,629
Susanna look..

1148
02:07:36,938 --> 02:07:40,931
This is a big misunderstanding,
Susanna.

1149
02:07:41,709 --> 02:07:43,438
Please.. this is a..

1150
02:07:46,914 --> 02:07:50,680
This is a big misunderstanding,
Susanna. And, even if it isn't..

1151
02:07:51,018 --> 02:07:52,645
what is the proof?

1152
02:07:57,525 --> 02:07:58,924
What are you doing?

1153
02:07:59,393 --> 02:08:01,020
Susanna, please don't do this.

1154
02:08:02,964 --> 02:08:06,695
Please, darling,
please listen to me.

1155
02:08:35,229 --> 02:08:38,824
Su.. Sus..

1156
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:40,627
Susanna..

1157
02:08:44,305 --> 02:08:45,533
It's your turn.

1158
02:08:54,315 --> 02:08:56,010
Susanna..

1159
02:08:58,586 --> 02:09:02,420
Susanna.. I needed the money.

1160
02:09:03,825 --> 02:09:06,350
I really needed it.

1161
02:09:06,427 --> 02:09:08,418
I lost a lot of money in business.

1162
02:09:08,496 --> 02:09:11,431
I went bloody bankrupt, Susanna.

1163
02:09:44,398 --> 02:09:45,763
Oh God!

1164
02:09:51,305 --> 02:09:52,465
Susanna..

1165
02:09:52,540 --> 02:09:53,700
Susanna..

1166
02:09:54,442 --> 02:09:56,637
Susanna, I loved you, Susanna.

1167
02:09:57,278 --> 02:10:00,008
Susanna.. I.. I really loved you.

1168
02:10:01,249 --> 02:10:03,683
I truly love you Susanna,
believe me.

1169
02:10:17,498 --> 02:10:18,658
Oh God!

1170
02:10:25,306 --> 02:10:28,833
I wasn't even destined
for a peaceful death.

1171
02:10:29,477 --> 02:10:33,538
I had forgotten all the bullets,
next to Tarafdar's body.

1172
02:10:41,822 --> 02:10:45,724
Sleeping pills had failed once..

1173
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:49,859
and I didn't want
to hang on a noose.

1174
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:34,667
Jesus!

1175
02:11:39,981 --> 02:11:41,039
Susie!

1176
02:11:49,357 --> 02:11:51,985
Oh my Jesus..

1177
02:11:52,059 --> 02:11:53,856
Susie!

1178
02:12:59,593 --> 02:13:04,030
I'd lost respect for myself.
I was shattered.

1179
02:13:04,598 --> 02:13:09,467
For a professional swimmer
drowning isn't an option.

1180
02:13:17,478 --> 02:13:21,505
I was punishing
myself for my cowardice.

1181
02:13:21,949 --> 02:13:24,941
A new death every moment.

1182
02:13:29,623 --> 02:13:31,591
And then I found out..

1183
02:13:31,826 --> 02:13:33,817
I was dead for the rest of world.

1184
02:13:40,468 --> 02:13:45,633
I couldn't let
Maggie's sacrifice go in vain.

1185
02:13:45,706 --> 02:13:53,044
She forced me to take
on life, one last time.

1186
02:13:57,284 --> 02:14:02,415
Of course, you were
forced into everything..

1187
02:14:02,490 --> 02:14:06,290
into marriage, into murders!

1188
02:14:07,828 --> 02:14:13,789
Did you ever stop to wonder,
why you committed all those sins?

1189
02:14:13,934 --> 02:14:15,060
For whom?

1190
02:14:18,839 --> 02:14:21,774
For my heart.

1191
02:14:21,842 --> 02:14:23,503
Your heart.. great!

1192
02:14:23,577 --> 02:14:24,737
My heart.

1193
02:14:24,812 --> 02:14:26,404
The heart..

1194
02:14:26,480 --> 02:14:29,278
For the sake of your heart..

1195
02:14:29,350 --> 02:14:32,410
you sent six people to their..

1196
02:14:32,486 --> 02:14:35,512
final abode before their time.

1197
02:14:39,627 --> 02:14:42,858
You won't understand, sugar.

1198
02:14:45,900 --> 02:14:47,424
Here's a little fact.

1199
02:14:47,501 --> 02:14:50,493
Every single wife..

1200
02:14:50,671 --> 02:14:54,698
has at least once in
her life entertained..

1201
02:14:54,775 --> 02:15:00,270
the thought of
getting rid of her husband.

1202
02:15:01,282 --> 02:15:03,443
Why don't you ask your wife?

1203
02:15:03,617 --> 02:15:06,450
I'm sure she's thought
of at least one way..

1204
02:15:06,520 --> 02:15:08,511
to murder you.

1205
02:15:13,928 --> 02:15:17,762
Any idea why you've survived?

1206
02:15:18,933 --> 02:15:20,730
A child!

1207
02:15:22,403 --> 02:15:25,304
A child makes..

1208
02:15:27,274 --> 02:15:31,301
the husband more acceptable.

1209
02:15:36,750 --> 02:15:40,516
That's the reason why
you never had a child!

1210
02:15:43,924 --> 02:15:48,793
You fulfilled that desire of mine.

1211
02:15:52,766 --> 02:15:57,635
Never have I shared
our love with anyone..

1212
02:15:58,672 --> 02:16:00,833
nor will I ever in the future.

1213
02:16:01,008 --> 02:16:02,839
In the future?

1214
02:16:05,846 --> 02:16:08,610
Now you won't find a
sacrificial lamb, Saheb.

1215
02:16:09,583 --> 02:16:11,881
Your beauty..

1216
02:16:15,923 --> 02:16:18,551
You've become a little scary.

1217
02:16:18,826 --> 02:16:23,388
Scary.. scary, scary!

1218
02:16:23,464 --> 02:16:29,334
Scary.. scary, scary!

1219
02:16:32,606 --> 02:16:37,339
He has accepted me
for the person I am..

1220
02:16:37,811 --> 02:16:42,748
with all my sins and
virtues and this scary..

1221
02:16:42,816 --> 02:16:46,479
scary face of mine.

1222
02:16:48,389 --> 02:16:49,788
Who?

1223
02:16:51,792 --> 02:16:53,851
My seventh husband.

1224
02:16:55,396 --> 02:16:57,956
I feel like getting
married again, you know.

1225
02:16:58,732 --> 02:17:00,324
For a change!

1226
02:17:02,369 --> 02:17:03,700
For a change?

1227
02:17:05,906 --> 02:17:10,434
There's a beautiful church,
in the old city.

1228
02:17:14,048 --> 02:17:15,675
Will you come?

1229
02:17:16,817 --> 02:17:20,617
Tomorrow morning. Eleven o'clock.

1230
02:17:30,364 --> 02:17:34,357
I won't let you take
another life, Saheb.

1231
02:17:41,842 --> 02:17:43,742
Hey sugar!

1232
02:17:44,578 --> 02:17:47,604
You won't be able to save him.

1233
02:17:50,517 --> 02:17:53,816
He has already
sacrificed himself.. for love.

1234
02:17:57,591 --> 02:17:59,991
He is dead.

1235
02:18:02,529 --> 02:18:03,962
And this time..

1236
02:18:04,031 --> 02:18:07,865
I am going to drink his blood.

1237
02:18:59,486 --> 02:19:05,015
The world, the
universe and its radiance..

1238
02:19:05,292 --> 02:19:08,420
aren't enough to satisfy my soul.

1239
02:19:08,662 --> 02:19:16,296
This peace, this joy, can be
attained, only through Jesus Christ.

1240
02:19:17,004 --> 02:19:19,768
Who is very dear to me.

1241
02:19:20,641 --> 02:19:23,235
The Lord of the Universe.

1242
02:19:23,977 --> 02:19:27,811
I, Sister Anna..

1243
02:19:28,982 --> 02:19:31,610
in the presence of Mother Mary..

1244
02:19:31,785 --> 02:19:35,277
solemnly vow to Lord Jesus that..

1245
02:19:35,722 --> 02:19:39,556
from now on I belong to Him alone.

1246
02:19:42,496 --> 02:19:46,626
From today he is my only master..

1247
02:19:48,469 --> 02:19:49,902
my spouse.

1248
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:13,291
There is not a soul in sight now

1249
02:20:15,629 --> 02:20:20,896
Come, acknowledge me now, at least

1250
02:20:23,871 --> 02:20:30,299
Not a soul stirs this moment

1251
02:20:32,446 --> 02:20:37,281
Come, embrace me in your fold

1252
02:20:40,787 --> 02:20:46,817
Embrace me just this once

1253
02:20:47,060 --> 02:20:51,827
Then take me along

1254
02:20:53,000 --> 02:21:01,840
Hope there is no
misery on the other side

1255
02:21:02,342 --> 02:21:05,038
Jesus

1256
02:21:06,613 --> 02:21:09,548
Jesus

1257
02:21:10,083 --> 02:21:14,952
You hear the tolling
of the church bells

1258
02:21:15,022 --> 02:21:17,889
Jesus

1259
02:21:18,725 --> 02:21:23,253
Yet all you choose
is to keep your quiet

1260
02:21:23,530 --> 02:21:25,623
Jesus

1261
02:21:27,601 --> 02:21:35,667
How do you pick who amongst
us is worthy of your grace

1262
02:21:35,976 --> 02:21:38,501
Jesus

1263
02:21:39,713 --> 02:21:44,309
You hear the tolling
of the church bells

1264
02:21:44,551 --> 02:21:46,951
Jesus

1265
02:21:48,288 --> 02:21:52,725
Yet all you choose
is to keep your quiet

1266
02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:54,860
Jesus

1267
02:22:07,641 --> 02:22:10,735
I want to confess my sins, Father!

1268
02:22:13,313 --> 02:22:15,406
My seven sins.

1269
02:22:42,376 --> 02:22:43,866
Arun.. Arun!

1270
02:22:43,944 --> 02:22:46,310
Stop the car! Stop it fast.

1271
02:22:50,417 --> 02:22:52,942
Arun! Arun!

1272
02:23:00,894 --> 02:23:03,886
I hate you, I hate you.

1273
02:23:05,432 --> 02:23:06,660
I'm fine, Nandini.

1274
02:23:06,733 --> 02:23:08,530
I told you I'll come back soon.

1275
02:23:08,568 --> 02:23:10,001
You lied to me!

1276
02:23:10,070 --> 02:23:12,800
I'm fine, I'm fine!

1277
02:23:20,480 --> 02:23:21,845
Did you say anything to the police?

1278
02:23:21,915 --> 02:23:23,940
I haven't told them the truth yet.

1279
02:23:23,984 --> 02:23:26,282
Or you'd be in jail for
the rest of your life.

1280
02:23:27,020 --> 02:23:28,578
If you ever..

1281
02:23:29,289 --> 02:23:31,484
try to see her again..

1282
02:23:31,725 --> 02:23:33,784
then I swear I'll kill you.

1283
02:23:34,628 --> 02:23:35,822
Never.

1284
02:23:36,430 --> 02:23:37,556
Ever.

1285
02:23:37,631 --> 02:23:38,893
She's dead.

1286
02:23:39,866 --> 02:23:41,458
Forever.

1287
02:23:46,440 --> 02:23:47,998
- Promise? - Promise.

1288
02:23:50,977 --> 02:23:52,672
What happened to your specs?

1289
02:23:55,649 --> 02:23:57,412
Someone cast an evil eye.
