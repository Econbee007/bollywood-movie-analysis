00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,200
'Most of them'

'fall asleep peacefully.'

4
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,120
'But a few are not so fortunate.'

5
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,400
'They get trapped in
a frightening phenomenon'

00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,560
'called Anaesthesia Awareness.'

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,600
'These patients remain conscious'

'but are completely paralysed.'

00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,320
'They can hear sounds, '

10
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,960
'and experience pain'

11
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,480
'but are unable to scream
for help.'

12
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,080
'The cause of this remains a mystery.'

14
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,080
Some wine, ma'am?
- Thank you.

15
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,880
All the business days...

16
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,080
I heard that.

17
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,560
Yeah.

18
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,080
Oh God, I am late.

19
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,800
Just where the hell is
that interpreter?

20
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,880
These two morons are giving me
bloody migraine.

21
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
Alright. Thank you.

22
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
Thanks.

23
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,480
No!

24
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,240
Alright.
- Maybe we shouldn't.

25
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,360
It might have religious sentiments.

26
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
Like I care.

27
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,200
'There were a lot of
beautiful women at the party, '

28
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,000
'but I couldn't take
my eyes off her.'

29
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,960
'She was definitely special.'

30
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,280
'That's probably because she
didn't seem to be from this world.'

31
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,520
'Just like me.'

32
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,240
'And that's why I liked her.'

33
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,920
Greetings, Mrs Singh.

34
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,440
You're Indian, right?
- Yes.

35
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
My name is Ria.

36
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,160
I am the guest relations officer
with this hotel,

37
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,120
and a part time interpreter too.

38
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
Thank God.

39
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,080
At least someone speaks Hindi here.

40
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,960
Well nowadays, most Indians
prefer to speak English,

41
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,680
but our guests don't.

42
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,160
That's why you were brought in

43
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,800
to help.
- Okay.

44
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,920
Hi, mom.
- Adi.

45
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,720
You should have gotten here
before I did.

46
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,440
You know how important
this deal is for us.

47
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
I know.

48
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,680
Hi.
- Hi.

49
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,880
Well, as you know my husband
Vikram Singh started this company,

50
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,840
Vikramaditya Group Of Industries,

51
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,320
15 years ago.

52
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,960
Today, as we go global,

53
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,240
I wish he was alive to see this.

54
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,480
'I wish he was alive to see this.'

55
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,120
Aditya my son here handles the
international business division.

56
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,800
Don't be fooled by his chocolate looks.

57
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,160
There is a sharp business mind with
an international finance degree

58
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,200
behind it that works non-stop.

59
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
Arabic!

60
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,800
When did you learn Arabic?

61
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,120
That's all the Arabic I know.
- Hey, Adam!

62
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
One second.

63
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,720
Excuse me. I have to go.

64
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,280
Excuse me.
- Please wait.

65
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,720
They do not bother to understand
our people, our language or our country.

66
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,680
The Americans gave us slavery,
we gave them presidents for two terms.

67
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,400
You knew he could speak English!

68
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,480
What's so funny?

69
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You may go now.

70
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,880
'She didn't know what she had done.'

71
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,080
My mom was upset with her.

72
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,760
And she would never be forgiven
for her mistake.

73
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,840
I am sure that we will enjoy

74
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,640
a mutually respectful
and beneficial relationship.

75
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,760
You give us the raw material and
we will give you a honest price.

76
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,400
Together we will explore new markets.

77
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,920
Deal?
- Deal.

78
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,080
Yeah.

79
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,720
Ladies and gentlemen, dinner is served.

80
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,040
After you, ma'am.

81
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,280
Okay. Come.

82
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,880
Well, Mr Ali, I hope you've been
enjoying your stay at the hotel here.

83
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,880
If there is anything you need,
please feel free to call Aditya.

84
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,480
He will always be available.

85
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,320
'Well, as you know my husband
Vikram Singh started this company'

86
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,520
'Vikramaditya Group Of Industries,
15 years ago.'

87
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,480
'Today, as we go global'

88
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,080
'I wish he was alive to see this.'

89
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
'I am sorry, dad.'

90
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,480
'Adi!'
- Save him.

91
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,080
'Adi!'

92
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,160
'Dad!'

93
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,720
'Adi!'

94
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Sorry, mom.

95
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,600
20 missed calls, Adi.

96
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,280
Where had you been?

97
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
It's rude

98
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,200
to leave the guests without
informing anyone.

99
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
I got tired, mom,

100
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,160
so I came to my room.

101
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,560
And I dozed off.

102
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,920
And where are you now?

103
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,800
I am in the room.
- Really?

104
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Shit!

105
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,880
'He got there first.'

106
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,160
'Klinsmann challenging him.'

107
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,320
'Putting Klinsmann in the game
on the far side.'

108
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,720
Clause 77 B doesn't seem
right in the contract.

109
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,960
We shouldn't give them
so much advantage.

110
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,080
What do you think, Adi?

111
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,040
'Goes off for the challenge.'

112
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,960
'Argentina down to ten men.
The first man ever'

113
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,600
'to be sent off in a world cup final.'

114
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,640
Your entire generation will go deaf
before they turn 40.

115
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,560
The volume is too high.

116
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,400
I can't even hear myself.

117
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,000
Hello.

118
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,520
My phone is ringing somewhere.

119
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,680
Over there. It's not here.

120
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,600
'I'm a great admirer
of German football.'

121
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,760
'They have played some of the best games
over the last 15 years.'

122
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,200
Hello.

123
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
Hello.

124
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,880
'There's no question, it's a foul.'

125
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,560
I can't hear anything.

126
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,080
Set the TV on mute.

127
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
'Not been...'

128
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,560
Sorry. Yes, tell me.

129
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,400
'Hello, Mrs Singh, I am speaking
from the Parulkar Heart Institute.'

130
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,560
'We have found a donor.
Can you come here tomorrow?'

131
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,440
But I am in Dubai and I've a very
important meeting tomorrow morning.

132
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,120
'Ma'am, we have found a donor
with great difficulty.'

133
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,840
'You won't get such
an opportunity again.'

134
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,160
Fine. I will be there. Bye.

135
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
Adi, I am going back.

136
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,320
I will take the morning flight.

137
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,400
Oh God, I hate this!

138
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,080
I hate to leave you here.

139
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,960
This isn't the first time.

140
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,920
Adi, you've to sign the deal
on Monday. Don't forget.

141
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,680
I don't know how we will pull this off.

142
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,200
It's a weekend.

143
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,840
Why are you going?

144
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,640
What could be more important for you
than this multi-million dollar contract?

145
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
Huh?

146
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,640
You.

147
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
But I am here.

148
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,720
Adi, they found a perfect match,

149
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,360
after trying for two years.

150
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,200
That's not the perfect match.

151
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,920
I don't like it.

152
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,560
What are you talking about?

153
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,520
You're going to Mumbai to meet
Trehan, right? - Yes, but...

154
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,920
Stop talking nonsense.

155
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,800
Monday at 11 AM. Don't oversleep.

156
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,880
Adi,

157
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,280
I've worked hard for
the company's success.

158
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,080
Now, this is the next big step.

159
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,480
But first, I want you to be
completely okay.

160
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,080
Yeah.

161
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,200
'I've told you many times that
I don't want a heart transplant.'

162
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,840
'But you've always done'

163
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,640
'what you want.'

164
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,000
Okay?
- Thank you very much.

165
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,360
Thanks.
- Thanks.

166
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,720
I hate to leave you over here.

167
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,360
Don't sleep late in the night,

168
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,360
and don't forget to take your vitamins
after breakfast. Did you hear me?

169
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,640
Yes.

170
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,440
Will you wake up in time for breakfast?

171
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,760
Okay, mom. I will wake up
and take my vitamins as well.

172
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,720
I will take care of everything.

173
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,000
You should get going,
otherwise you'll miss your flight.

174
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,120
You seem to be in hurry
to send me away.

175
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,640
Take care.
- Love you, mom.

176
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,800
See you. Don't roam around much. Okay?
- Okay, mom.

177
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,120
Alright. Bye.
- Bye.

178
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,720
'What do I wish for?'

179
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,120
'What is this feeling?'

180
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,400
'The one I didn't know until yesterday, '

181
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,000
'is with me every moment now.'

182
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,760
'Which colour is this?'

183
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,640
'Whose company is this?'

184
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,640
'What is this rhythm?'

185
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,520
'Whose voice is this?'

186
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,800
'Why do I feel restless?'

187
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,000
'Why does her fragrance
enthral me?'

188
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,440
'I haven't met her yet.'

189
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,080
'Why then'

190
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,880
'is she always around?'

191
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,640
'What do I wish for?'

192
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,480
'What is this feeling?'

Do you want white powder?

229
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,960
Hey, do you want white powder?

230
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,040
It's good quality. Do you want some?

231
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,640
Dude, want some cocaine?

232
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,560
White powder. It's really fresh stuff.

233
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,040
Everybody buys it from me.

234
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,280
So, you want some?

235
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,600
It's amazing stuff.
- I don't do drugs, man. Seriously.

236
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,480
Okay, listen,

237
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,760
would you like to buy diamonds?
I've got d-class VVS.

238
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,600
It's five carat
at 25 percent jewellery price.

239
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,600
It's amazing Dubai's stuff.

240
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Would you like to buy it?

241
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,720
Tell me if you want to buy.

242
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,520
Want it?

243
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,240
Let's go.

244
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
Come on.

245
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,000
You're going to love this, bro.

246
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,320
Good.
- Yes.

247
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
Very good.

248
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,200
10,000 dollars.

249
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Ten dollars.

250
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,320
What are you saying, man?

251
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,840
10,000 dollars!

252
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,400
Ten dollars.
- What?

253
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,320
Check this out, bro.

254
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,680
I know the class, cut, caratage
and clarity of this diamond.

255
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,160
It's all good.

256
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,800
I do diamonds, you see.

257
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,720
You were going to give
this to me, weren't you?

258
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,360
As far as I know, it's a fake.

259
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,560
But anyway, you know what?

260
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,360
I like your style.

261
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I will take it.

262
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,600
Ten dollars.

263
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,800
Damn! You short played me, man!

264
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,200
By the way,

265
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,520
if you deal in real diamonds,

266
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,520
what will you do with a fake?

267
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,120
It may be a fake for you,

268
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
but for me, it's real.

269
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,680
It's the first independent deal
of my life.

270
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,400
It's party time.

271
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,920
Excuse me.

272
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,280
Yes, sir.
- One espresso please.

273
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,400
Sure.

274
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Hey.

275
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,360
Keep the change.
- Thank you, sir.

276
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,000
Screwed, man.

277
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,960
I don't know how to thank you, Trehan.

278
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,800
Sanjeev.

279
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Gayatri,

280
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,120
don't raise your hopes too much.

281
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,520
I've already told you that a transplant
doesn't guarantee anything.

282
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,080
This surgery has
a minimal success rate.

283
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,720
The body could reject the heart
even after a transplant.

284
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,040
And if Adi doesn't want
to undergo surgery,

285
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,160
his attitude will further reduce
his chances.

286
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,960
Let me deal with his attitude.

287
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,680
I will convince him.

288
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,600
Now that we have found a donor,
it will be easy to convince him.

289
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,840
I have a request, Sanjeev.

290
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,040
You must perform the surgery.

291
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,040
I can't trust anyone else.

292
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,760
You know what Adi means to me.

293
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,800
Of course, Gayatri.

294
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,120
I will explain the entire procedure
to you tomorrow.

295
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,440
I have the tapes of some surgeries that
I had performed.

296
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,240
You can see them.
- Okay.

297
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,240
You'll get an idea.
- Okay.

298
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,680
Oh! It's 1:30.

299
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
Lunch?

300
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,520
I am really tired. I'm came here
directly from the airport.

301
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
Rain check?

302
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,560
But you will eat, won't you?

303
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,120
I don't want to go out.

304
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,800
Besides,

305
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,360
I've to talk to Adi.
I'll just take two minutes.

306
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,800
Pass.

307
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
Here.

308
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,640
Man!

309
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,240
Come back here.

310
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,760
'No, Adi, you can't play football.'

311
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,960
Give the ball. Pass the ball.

312
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,280
Please, give the ball.

313
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,280
Come on, man.
- Sorry.

314
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,400
I am coming there.

315
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,280
Okay.
- Pass the ball.

316
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,840
That's our ball.
- Chill, guys.

317
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,200
Yes!

318
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,640
Hey, mom.

319
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,360
Hi, Adi.
- Did you reach safely?

320
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,480
How's the temperature?
- The temperature!

321
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,840
It's Mumbai. Always the same.

322
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,960
Not Mumbai. I am talking about
Trehan's temperature.

323
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,760
Oh! Shut up.

324
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,480
Where are you?
- Mom, I am just chilling.

325
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,840
Hanging out, you know.

326
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,720
No late nights, okay? Please.

327
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,200
You too, mom. Please!

328
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
Okay.

329
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,000
Mom, I got to go. Okay?

330
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,040
Love you, mom. Bye.
- Bye.

331
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,480
Make it.

332
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,360
Naughty fellow.

333
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,440
Come.
- Thanks.

334
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,280
Children grow up, Gayatri.

335
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,160
A single woman like you

336
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,600
should think about her life.

337
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,200
Adi is my life.

338
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,840
By the way, Sanjeev, how is Ila?

339
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,040
She is good, I guess.

340
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,840
She is on

341
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,680
her third vacation trip this year.
Malay forests.

342
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,080
Gayatri, you know that

343
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,880
we were together just for the children.

344
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,920
And now, the children have
all grown up.

345
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,560
I take your leave.

346
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,440
And thanks once again.

347
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,040
Okay.

348
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,200
Don't touch me!

349
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,400
'Hey, how are you, baby?'

350
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,960
Dare touch me!
- The camera...

351
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,600
Baby!
- Leave me alone.

352
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,120
What's your price, baby?
- Come with us.

353
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,040
Wow! You're looking so hot.

354
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,480
Hey!

355
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,600
What's your rate, baby?
- Look at her. Yeah!

356
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,080
Hey!

357
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,560
Who are you waving at?

358
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,440
Hey.
- We are here. Who are you waving at?

359
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
Stop it!

360
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,960
Oh, wow! Look at her.

361
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,080
Hey, guys!

362
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,000
Yes. Who is he?
- Who are you?

363
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,760
Are you guys tourists?

364
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,240
Hey, dude, buzz off.

365
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,960
Yeah, right.

366
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,040
Hi.

367
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,480
Hey, who are you? Back off.

368
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,680
Alright...

369
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,400
Sure. She needs to go too.

370
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,120
Come on.
- Hey, wait.

371
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,440
Back off, wise guy!
- Get going, dude.

372
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,360
Do you know her?

373
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,160
Yes.
- No.

374
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,240
What an idiot!

375
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,840
Run!

376
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,440
Run!
- Catch them!

377
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,680
What was that?
- Pepper spray.

378
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,760
What?

379
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,160
Do you always carry it?
- Yes.

380
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,680
So that I can save people like you.

381
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,480
What? Run.

382
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,880
Run.

383
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,960
Stop running!

384
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,400
Okay, Lara Croft,

385
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,960
we are safe now.

386
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,880
I am Ria.
- Okay.

387
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,360
Ria.

388
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,080
Do you remember the way to hotel?

389
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,880
May be.

390
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,800
You shouldn't roam around alone.

391
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,120
It's dangerous.

392
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,720
Can I drop you to the hotel?

393
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,000
Yeah, sure.

394
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,400
But where is the car?

395
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,000
I don't have a car.

396
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,600
No car. How do we get there?

397
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,160
Okay, let's walk.
- Let's go.

398
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,800
You're on a business trip, right?
- Yeah.

399
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,800
But your mom went back.

400
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,840
Are you on a holiday?
- No.

401
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,360
It was the weekend,

402
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,280
so I stayed back.

403
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,600
Are you a local?

404
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,240
No. I am from Afghanistan.
- Oh!

405
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,640
I lost my parents in a car bombing.

406
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,800
I was the only survivor.

407
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,880
I am sorry.

408
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,720
I couldn't forgive myself
for a long time

409
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,240
for having survived.

410
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,560
But then I thought I should live

411
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,080
their share of life as well.

412
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,000
Perhaps, I will find peace.

413
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,680
Since then life's been good.

414
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,560
It's just been a month
since I came here.

415
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,560
Earlier I was at the Cairo branch
of the same hotel.

416
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480
Oh!

417
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,360
That's why you speak Arabic!

418
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,960
Yes, you're right.
- Okay.

419
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,720
Here we are.

420
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,640
Well, thank you

421
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,560
for saving me from the goons
and bringing me here safe and sound.

422
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,160
Would you like to have coffee?

423
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,440
Hotel staff

424
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,480
can't socialise with
the guests at the hotel.

425
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,000
There are rules. Sorry.

426
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,000
Bye.

427
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,160
Congrats, Mr Singh.
- Here we go.

428
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,680
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

429
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,520
Cheers to our alliance, Mr Ali.

430
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,040
Cheers!
- Cheers!

431
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,160
Together we will conquer new horizons.

432
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,640
And Adi,

433
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,800
well done. I am proud of you.

434
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,840
Now, come home soon.

435
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,800
Miss you.
- I miss you too.

436
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,280
Just signing the deal isn't enough.

437
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,680
The manufacturing and delivery

438
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,240
should be exactly as per schedule.

439
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,400
Make new schedules. I want to see them.

440
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,640
But there's place in our schedule
for this new order.

441
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,040
Then make the schedule accordingly.
- But ma'am...

442
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,600
Our workers are already
working two shifts.

443
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,120
We can't push them.

444
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,080
There can be a third shift.

445
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,040
I don't want excuses.

446
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,680
What if the workers refuse?

447
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,640
Then replace them.

448
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,960
Okay.

449
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,160
Mr Mahajan,

450
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,840
I pay you to find the answers,
not to ask questions.

451
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,440
Just do it.
- Okay.

452
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,640
Radhika, come with me.

453
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
Yes, ma'am.

454
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,800
Adi's ticket is confirmed.

455
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,720
Don't forget to send a car for him.

456
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,360
Ma'am, Mr Singh has extended his trip.

457
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,240
He isn't arriving tomorrow.
- What?

458
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,720
Why didn't you tell me?

459
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,080
How can he change the ticket
without asking me?

460
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,240
Call him.
- Okay.

461
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,720
'The number you're trying to reach
is currently not reachable.'

462
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,200
Switched off.

463
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
Hi!

464
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,040
Let's go out for a stroll.

465
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,760
Sorry, I am on duty.

466
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,960
Your Mr Adam Kowalski has booked me

467
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,840
for interpretation.
- Oh!

468
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,640
I asked him to do that.

469
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,880
What?
- Yes.

470
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,400
Let's go. Come on.

471
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,360
Why do you need an interpreter?
- I don't.

472
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,920
Come on. Let's go. I want you
to show me Dubai today.

473
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,880
Come on. Sit.

511
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,960
Hold on, Ria.

512
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,440
Just a moment.

513
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,840
This is for you.

514
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,360
Do you like it?

515
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,520
Why are you giving this to me?

516
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
No particular reason.

517
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,880
Without rhyme or reason?
- Yes.

518
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,560
We spend a lovely time together,

519
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,680
so I thought I should give you a gift.

520
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,520
So that we can have

521
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,280
a lot more fun next time.

522
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,760
Fun?
- Yes.

523
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,480
Next time?
- Yes.

524
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,560
I thought you're different from others,

525
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,120
but you're worse than them.
- What?

526
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,680
They are what they seem to be.

527
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,960
Who do you think you are?

528
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,040
Did you think

529
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,720
a diamond ring will make me
jump into your arms?

530
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,400
You think you can buy me!

531
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,960
Do you think I am for sale? Here.

532
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,200
Wait. No, Ria...

533
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,600
Ria, listen to me.

534
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,960
Just leave me alone. Go away.
- Let me explain.

535
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,680
I was just kidding.

536
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,520
You are getting it wrong. It's just...

537
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,640
It's just a ring. Come on.

538
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,120
Come on, man. Give me a break.

539
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,320
Ria, that guy has been staring
at you for a very long time.

540
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,640
What's his problem?

541
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,120
Cheers!

542
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,200
What the hell is going on?

543
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,280
Stop it.

544
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,720
Just stop it!

545
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,640
I have just begun.

546
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,840
What do you want?

547
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,960
I want you to listen to me carefully.

548
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,960
And then do whatever you want.

549
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,800
Go ahead.

550
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,120
Come with me.
- Look, it's the same girl.

551
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,040
Yes, pal.
- So, what's her price?

552
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,360
Ten dollars.

553
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,400
And she thought it was extravagant.

554
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,160
Do you get it now?

555
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,760
I bought the diamond ring
for just ten dollars.

556
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,560
Why didn't you tell me?

557
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,320
Excuse me.

558
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,120
Did you give me a chance?

559
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,840
Before you gave it to me, you idiot!

560
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,000
I don't like trophy boyfriends.

561
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,760
Trophy boyfriends?
- Yes.

562
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,320
They have credit cards, but no hearts.

563
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,560
For them,
money speaks louder than words.

564
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,040
I avoid such people.

565
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,720
I am looking for someone

566
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,720
who is simple

567
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,600
and kind hearted.

568
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,400
I am not good at heart, Ria.

569
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,120
'Perhaps, I was at a point in my life'

570
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,680
'from where I couldn't go back'

571
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,120
'or move forward.'

572
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,960
'It was as simple as that'

573
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,880
'and as complicated.'

574
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,120
Adi!

575
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,600
Adi.

576
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,880
Oh my God!

577
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,280
What's wrong?

578
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,360
Open your mouth. Quickly.

579
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,840
Somebody help!

580
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,920
Adi, what happened to you?

581
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,840
Adi.

582
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,160
I told you

583
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,360
I am not good at heart.

584
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,440
Adi!

585
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,760
Good morning.

586
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,240
Good morning.

587
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,720
Nothing to worry.

588
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,640
All your reports are normal.

589
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,080
You scared me.

590
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,680
You gave me a new life.

591
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,600
You've also changed my life.

592
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,320
We are quits.

593
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,600
I can't do this.

594
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,400
You shouldn't be here. You have to go.

595
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,120
When I am not worried about the future,

596
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,040
why are you afraid?

00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:03,280

621

Good morning.

622
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,320
I will just get ready. Okay?

623
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,160
Adi.

624
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,440
Ria.
- What?

625
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,040
I can't do this.

626
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,200
Of course, you can.

627
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,800
Now we are together.

628
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,800
We will do it.

629
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,680
Ria,

630
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,120
we can't let our emotions
get the better of us.

631
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,440
Our emotions are overwhelming, Adi.

632
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,720
Are you having second thoughts about me?

633
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,440
What happened to you
all of a sudden, Aditya?

634
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,240
Listen to me, Adi.

635
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,040
I know you're scared.

636
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,120
Don't worry.

637
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,600
Everything will be fine.

638
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,800
Let's just live the moment.

639
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,400
Let's not worry about the future.

640
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,640
That's the problem, Ria.

641
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,840
This relationship is like my life.

642
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,280
It has no future.

643
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,960
Please end this relationship.

644
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,840
You deserve better.

645
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,760
You're right.

646
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,560
You don't have a future.

647
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,560
But I do.

648
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,480
Do you know why?

649
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,080
Because you measure life
by the years you live.

650
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,800
Whereas I live in the moment.

651
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,040
I await a better life,

652
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,840
whereas you await death.

653
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,880
Hence, don't even think that you

654
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,200
are doing me a favour by
ending this relationship.

655
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,560
You don't have the courage
to live, Aditya.

656
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,880
You're a coward.

657
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,320
Have a safe tour back to India,
Mr Singh.

658
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,320
Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

659
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,000
Hey, bro!

660
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,480
Hey, Adi.
- What's up?

661
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,160
So nice to see you.

662
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,880
I missed you, Sam.
- Missed you too.

663
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,736
How are you?
- I'm fine. Thank you. What about you?

664
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,600
Fantastic.
- What a pleasant surprise!

665
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,800
When did you return from Dubai?
- This morning.

666
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,320
What did you bring for me?

667
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,920
Sorry, no gifts.

668
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,240
No. That's okay.

669
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,440
Rich people usually give gifts
to those who don't need them.

670
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Stop it, Sam.

671
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,960
Sam, I want to get the transplant done.

672
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,480
I'm ready for it.
- I knew it.

673
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,360
I knew it.

674
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,120
You haven't returned empty-handed.

675
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,840
You have an interesting story
to tell me.

676
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,680
Tell me, hurry up.
- Patience. By the way,

677
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,680
new car, right? I love it.

678
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,360
Enjoying the false pride.

679
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,760
I'm getting late for the clinic.

680
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,720
Come, let's talk on the way.
- Okay. Let's go.

681
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,560
Her name is Ria.

682
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,280
Ria?
- Yeah.

683
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,680
Oh! She's the magician

684
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,600
who made you change your decision.

685
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,360
You kept refusing for so long

686
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,800
and now all of a sudden you're
ready for the operation!

687
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,480
Ria seems to be an amazing girl.

688
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,200
How did she manage to convince you?

689
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,200
She must've done it affectionately.

690
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,520
'You don't have the courage
to live, Aditya.'

691
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,040
'You're a coward.'

692
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,000
Does your mom know?

693
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,560
'No escape.
- No way, mom.'

694
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,920
'I'm so happy, Adi.'

695
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,320
'I wanted to talk to you about
the transplant.'

696
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,760
She must be very excited to know
that you are ready for the transplant.

697
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,440
She must have spoken to
the Dr Trehan by now.

698
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,960
You will perform the surgery, Sam.

699
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,840
Think about the risk, Adi.

700
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,640
More often than not

701
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,560
such complicated cases end in failure.

702
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,280
When you have someone like Dr Trehan
and his team, why do you want me?

703
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,720
I don't like Trehan.

704
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,080
Come on, Adi.

705
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,760
He's a reputed heart surgeon.

706
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,800
He's perfect for the surgery.

707
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,600
His only drawback is that
he is crazy about your mom.

708
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,280
So what's wrong with that?
- Yeah.

709
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,720
After all, you are crazy about
someone too.

710
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,200
Whatever.

711
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,920
Let's see.

712
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,160
Hello.
- Hey, mom.

713
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,960
Hi.
- Hi, Adi.

714
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,960
Dr Trehan and I wanted to see
what's special about this hospital

715
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,480
that you insist on
undergoing surgery over here.

716
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,040
How can you pass judgement
even before getting inside?

717
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,040
Come on, Adi. I am sensible enough
to understand.

718
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,520
Relax, Gayatri.

719
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,480
The success of an operation
doesn't merely depend on the hospital.

720
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,960
It also requires competent hands
and experience.

721
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,200
Let me deal with this.

722
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,160
I want to carry out some tests.

723
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,240
Okay.
- I want to do some fresh tests on Adi.

724
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,080
If you're talking about me,

725
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
talk to me.

726
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,640
Listen, son...
- I'm not your son.

727
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,760
Adi!

728
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,160
Please, don't try to be my dad.

729
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,480
Let me tell you this, mom.

730
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,680
Dr Trehan doesn't need to do all this.

731
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,400
Sam will operate on me.

732
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,000
Are you crazy?

733
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,680
How can he perform such a big surgery?

734
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,160
Although we have Dr Trehan with us!

735
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,320
Sam is my friend, mom.

736
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,480
No doctor would care more
for my life than him.

737
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,040
He saved my life once
and you know that, right?

738
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,800
What made you think
that I will allow it?

739
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,720
Mom, you didn't hear me.

740
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,400
I'm not asking you.

741
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,120
I'm just informing you.

742
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,920
This is ridiculous.

743
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:44,280
I won't allow some run-off-the-mill
doctor to operate on my son.

744
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,400
Adi.

745
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,080
I'll be in my office. Call me later.

746
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,440
Bye, Mrs Singh.

747
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,840
Bye, Dr Trehan.
- Sam...

748
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,720
Adi, we need to talk about this, okay?

749
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,120
Call me.

750
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,680
'I have complete faith in Sam.'

751
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,760
'He's my friend, '

752
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,760
'father and brother.'

753
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,640
'Everything.'

754
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,640
'Now, '

755
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,960
'he's going to give me
a new lease of life.'

756

764
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,360
Sam,

765
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,440
we have been trying to find
Ria for the last two months.

766
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,680
But we haven't got any information
about her yet.

767
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,960
I don't know what to do.

768
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,920
I cannot live without her.

769
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,000
On an aircraft, we're told

770
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,920
to wear the oxygen
masks ourselves first

771
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,600
before helping others.

772
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,640
Likewise, you need to get well first.

773
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,120
Then we'll find Ria.

774
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,680
Have patience.

775
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,040
We're already late.

776
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,680
On top of that, it has started raining.

777
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,120
The governor had to throw a party today.

778
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,600
Who's she?

779
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,840
Mom, she's Ria.

780
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,280
She's my friend Harshad's sister.

781
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,480
Something seems to be wrong.
You carry on. I'll be with you shortly.

782
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,520
Come soon, I'll send
the car back for you.

783
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,760
Let me take you to the car.

784
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,040
Bye.

785
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,720
Ria, I'm so happy to see you.

786
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,800
I thought we would never meet again.

787
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,800
I don't believe this.

788
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,880
When did you come here?

789
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,680
And how?

790
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,160
I tried a lot to forget you,

791
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,840
but couldn't.

792
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,360
That's why, I'm here. But you...

793
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,960
You didn't even acknowledge
me in front of your mom.

794
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,080
I'm such an idiot

795
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,040
to have come all the way here for you.

796
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,280
Ria, listen to me.

797
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:50,960
I love you.

798
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,400
Come inside.

799
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,360
Please.

800
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,080
What about your mom?

801
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,600
Mom, she's Ria.
- I know.

802
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:16,800
I remember her now.

803
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,240
Is she not the girl who
was an interpreter in Dubai?

804
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,800
You lied to me that she
was your friend's sister.

805
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,240
This is unfair.

806
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,120
You know this is a diplomatic function.

807
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,600
You cannot bring any
random person here.

808
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,960
Let's go home.

809
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,640
Tell her to arrange for her
stay somewhere else.

810
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,160
Mom...

811
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,000
You are not the only person
she knows here.

812
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,560
Mom, stop it.

813
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,720
She doesn't know anyone here.

814
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,600
How can I leave her alone?

815
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,280
Besides, it's quite late.

816
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,360
She should have thought about
it before coming here.

817
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,600
She loves me, mom.

818
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,120
That's why she didn't
bother about anything.

819
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,240
But you won't understand.

820
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,600
Because...

821
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,800
She cannot come inside.

822
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:25,920
Are you coming inside?

823
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,800
You have decided already.

824
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,240
As usual.

825
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,280
Hey, Sam.
- Hi, Adi.

826
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,800
It's quite late. Is everything okay?
Come on in.

827
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:55,960
Just a second, Sam.

828
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,040
I have someone with me.

829
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,960
Come.

830
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,800
Ria.
- Ria!

831
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,760
Are you kidding me?

832
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,240
Hi, Ria.
- Hello.

833
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,000
Sorry, I cannot take her anywhere else,

834
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,240
so I brought her here.
- Get inside, first. Come on.

835
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,320
Come on.

836
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:22,240
'The number you've dialled is
currently unavailable.'

837
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,480
'Please try again later.'

838
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,040
'The number you've...'

839
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,400
Okay.

840
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,880
Adi, speak to your mom once.

841
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,960
She must have calmed down by now.

842
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,040
I can imagine her shock
when she saw Ria.

843
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,320
You should have told her before.

844
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,200
Anyway, not too late even now.

845
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,320
Trust me, everything will be fine.

846
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,760
You're right, Sam.

847
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,440
I should go home.
- Wait a second, Adi.

848
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,960
My entire team is coming to
my house tomorrow morning.

849
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:04,800
If they see Ria here...

850
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,960
I mean, I'm unmarried...

851
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,440
They might misconstrue...

852
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:09,800
I don't care.

853
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,880
But Ria...

854
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:21,720
<i>♪ Let my eyes close slowly. ♪</i>

855
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,800
<i>♪ Let me fall asleep. ♪</i>

856

<i>♪ Let sleep sweep me away
into a beautiful dream. ♪</i>

857
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,200
Ria.
- Yes?

858
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,240
Marry me.

859
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:48,960
What!

860
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,320
Right now.

861
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,480
Marry me.

862
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,040
It's five o' clock in the morning.

863
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:13,080
'The number you have
dialled is busy.'

864
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,400
Gayatri, I have already told you.

865
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,520
When children grow up,
you have to let go.

866
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:22,640
He's not like others, he needs me.

867
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,280
He should accept this.

868
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,680
But he's not thinking straight.

869
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,400
He's taken a wrong decision.

870
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,080
Forget about it.

871
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,640
If he has already decided,

872
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,360
you cannot impose your decision on him.

873
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,200
You need to be positive.

874
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,400
When a drop of water

875
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,720
swells a bit,

876
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,640
it speaks as if the ocean.

877
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,120
Lamps would have been blown out by now,

878
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:54,920
but there's someone

879
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,040
who prevents the wind.

880
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:02,040
No one can defy the verdict

881
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,480
passed by the supreme authority.

882
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,240
Mr Singh, please sign here.

883
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,240
Take this.

884
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,440
Thank you.

885
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,320
Okay.

886
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,120
Hear! Hear!

887
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,880
Congratulations! From now on you
are husband and wife. - Thank you.

888
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,360
Thank you.
- Congrats!

889
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,680
Love you, Sam.

What happened, Aditya?

919
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,040
I got a call from Sam.

920
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,640
I'm sorry, Aditya.

921
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,840
I had to call you all
of a sudden because

922
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,400
we found donor all of a sudden.

923
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:49,440
I hope you're completely
prepared for the operation.

924
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:50,440
I guess.

925
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,200
Hi! Are you Mr Aditya Singh?
- Yes.

926
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:53,600
Your mom is waiting for you

927
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,480
at the reception area
along with Dr Trehan.

928
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,080
Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

929
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,560
How did you come to know that
I was getting operated today?

930
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,280
I'm your mom.

931
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,720
Just a second.

932
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,120
Adi.

933
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:46,960
I'm very happy

934
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,800
that you have agreed to undergo surgery.

935
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:51,920
But...

936
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,520
I still believe that

937
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,040
Sam is not the...

938
01:07:58,520 --> 01:07:59,880
Adi, listen.

939
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,360
There's still time. Think about it.

940
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,640
Sam is not the right man
to conduct the surgery.

941
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:09,040
Dr Trehan should be doing it.

942
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,400
He's the best.

943
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,640
Okay?

944
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,240
God bless you.

945
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,400
I have decided already, mom.

946
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,720
Okay?

947
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,760
I'll see you soon. Okay.

948
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,200
I love you, mom.
- I love you too.

949
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,400
Bye.

950
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,080
Okay.

951
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,080
It's time to say good
bye to each other.

952
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,680
Only two minutes.

953
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,200
Thank you, Sam.
- Anytime.

954
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:20,720
You know what?

955
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,960
We'll start afresh
once you are out of the hospital.

956
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,560
Ria.
- Yes?

957
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:31,440
Will my new heart love you as much as

958
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:33,960
this one does?

959
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,040
Yes.
- I love you.

960
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,440
I love you too.

961
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,760
Okay, love birds, time up.

962
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,880
Can we get some more time?
- No.

963
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,080
Love you.

964
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,040
See you soon, my dear wife.

965
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:01,880
Say that again.

966
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,880
See you soon, my dear wife.

967
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:08,240
I think you should leave.
There is nothing you can really do.

968
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,840
Sure?
- Yes.

969
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:14,600
Call me if you need anything.
- Okay.

970
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,120
Take care.
- Okay.

971
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,080
You?
- I am Mrs Ria Aditya Singh.

972
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:43,760
When?

973
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,480
What?

974
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,440
When did my son get married?

975
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,120
When?

976
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:56,960
A few days ago.

977
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,120
Hi, guys.

978
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:04,800
I am Dr Gupta.

979
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,440
You can call me Gups.

980
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:09,160
Pleasure meeting you all.

981
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,640
Hello. Oh!

982
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,080
I would have shook your hand,
but you know...

983
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,720
Well, all set?

984
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,200
What's going on, Prakash?
Who is he?

985
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,360
I don't know. Your friend Patkar
is down with laryngitis.

986
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,480
That why he is here.

987
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,440
But I need Patkar.
- Even I want him,

988
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:26,680
but Gupta replaced him.

989
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:29,680
Well, no problem.

990
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,720
The anaesthetist may have changed,

991
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,640
but the operation is the same.
- Yes.

992
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:34,840
Come.

993
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,040
Hi, Dr Gupta. Let me introduce myself.

994
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,640
I am Dr Sameer Saxena.
You can call me Sam. - Hello.

995
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,600
This is Dr Prakash Solanki.
He is Dr Ajit Rathore. - Hello.

996
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:45,240
And this is my theatre assistant,
Jenny D'souza.

997
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:46,600
Hi, Jenny.

998
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,280
So, how's the patient feeling?

999
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,440
I am fine.

1000
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,800
Is everything alright, Sam?

1001
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,400
Just fine, Adi.

1002
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,480
Hey, Jenny.

1003
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,560
I will see you after the break.

1004
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:03,960
Okay.

1005
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,080
So Adi, this is it.

1006
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:10,440
Yeah.

1007
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,960
When you regain consciousness,

1008
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,920
we will be done with all this.

1009
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,480
I hope so.

1010
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:16,720
See you soon.

1011
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,400
See you soon, Sam.

1012
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,520
Dr Gupta.
- Yes?

1013
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,440
He is my friend. Be careful. Okay?

1014
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:25,720
Okay.

1015
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,560
Increase the supply of oxygen.
- Yes, doctor.

1016
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:36,920
Well.

1017
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:41,200
They must have asked you what you
have eaten in the past four hours.

1018
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,680
Yes.

1019
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,040
You must have received
general anaesthesia previously.

1020
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,400
Am I right?
- Yes.

1021
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,240
I read your pre-operative assessment

1022
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,240
and have made a special recipe for you.

1023
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:52,680
It's a cocktail.

1024
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,600
I am sure,

1025
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:57,080
you are going to like it.

1026
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,040
Here we go.

1027
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,160
Start counting backwards from ten.

1028
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,400
I can't.
- What?

1029
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,400
At school I learned to count straight.

1030
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,840
I am just kidding. I am so scared.

1031
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:15,200
Okay, relax. You will be fine.

1032
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:16,720
Here we go.

1033
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:19,560
Ten.

1034
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,480
Nine.

1035
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:24,760
Eight.

1036
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,640
Seven.

1037
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:29,880
Six.

1038
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,840
Five.

1039
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:39,480
Happy journey, my friend.

1040
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,440
Let yourself go.

1041
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,880
Okay. Let's get going.

1042
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,320
Hey, Gups, what did you give him?

1043
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,200
Midazolam, fentanyl,

1044
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,800
and a bit of vecuronium chaser.

1045
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,400
'God!'

1046
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,360
'Will the surgery leave a scar?'

1047
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:22,080
'Use some shaving cream, at least.'

1048
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,320
'Ew! What is that smell?'

1049
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,120
'But how do I know all this?'

1050
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,200
'I should be unconscious, right?'

1051
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,216
'I don't know how much time it takes
for an anaesthetic to take effect.'

1052
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:41,280
All okay, Gupta?

1053
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,040
He is sleeping like a log.
- 'Yeah, right!'

1054
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,080
Shall we begin?
- 'Wait a minute.'

1055
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:47,960
'Are you starting the operation?'

1056
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,720
'I should be unconscious, right?'

1057
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,760
'Why do I hear everyone's voices?'

1058
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,880
Ready, guys?
- 'How am I feeling all this?'

1059
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,680
'Sam, something is wrong!'

1060
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,640
'I think the anaesthesia
didn't work on me!'

1061
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:59,120
Alright, get the drips on.
- 'Guys!'

1062
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,520
'Hello! Something is not right!'

1063
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,400
'No, Sam!'

1064
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,560
Check on that monitor.
- 'I can hear everything.'

1065
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,640
'I am not unconscious, Sam!'

1066
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:10,240
'I am in my senses!'

1067
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,400
Okay, Gupta.
- 'Stop this!'

1068
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:13,760
'Someone please take a look!'

1069
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,040
'Take a look at the machines!'

1070
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:17,240
'Look at the bloody monitor, Sam!'

1071
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,200
Scalpel.
- 'Stop, Sam!'

1072
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,720
'Oh God! No!'

1073
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,280
'Please, stop it!'

1074
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,720
Do we have blood?
- 'Open your eyes, Adi!'

1075
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,440
'No, Sam!'

1076
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:31,080
'I'm in a lot of pain!'

1077
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,200
'Stop it, Sam!'

1078
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,800
'The pain is unbearable! Sam, please!'

1079
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,400
Make sure the scalpel is
sharper next time. - 'Sam!'

1080
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:48,720
'Please.'

1081
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,320
Saw.
- 'Please, Sam!'

1082
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,720
'Don't do this!'
- Okay.

1083
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,360
'Sam!'

1084
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,120
'No, Sam!'

1085
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,200
'Sam, please stop it!'

1086
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:05,000
'I can't bear this anymore!'

1087
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,400
'Sam!'

1088
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,176
'Think of something else
to forget the pain, Adi!'

1089
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,896
Drips go uniform there.
- 'Think about something else!'

1090
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,880
Prakash get ready to clamp.
- 'Distract yourself!'

1091
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,200
'Think about Ria!'

1092
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:17,360
'Ria!'

1093
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:19,600
'Help me!'

1094
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,800
'Ria, please save me!'

1095
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:24,560
'Ria! That's it!'

1096
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,440
'Ria!'

1097
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,320
'Focus on Ria, Adi.'

1098
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,720
'The memories of Ria!'

1099
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,680
'Think about Ria!'

1100
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:39,040
'Ria!'

1101
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,200
'Focus.'

1102
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:43,920
'No! Not this!'

1103
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:48,560
'Shit! What? No!'

1104
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,120
'No! Not this, Adi!'

1105
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:55,120
'Think about something else.
- I've a lot to do at the office.'

1106
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,601
'And if I don't work, your dad's dream
won't be fulfilled'

1107
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:59,400
'and this business
will be shut down.'

1108
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:02,080
'No, Adi, you can't play football.'

1109
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:03,640
'Stop it.'

1110
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,160
'You snatch everything.
You take away all the things I like.'

1111
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:07,160
'I hate you!'

1112
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:09,320
'At least agree to go for
a heart transplant.'

1113
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:10,880
'No.
- You owe it to yourself.'

1114
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,600
'No. I told you once.'

1115
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:14,760
'That's it.
- Help me!'

1116
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
'Sam!'

1117
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,920
'What's the patient's name?
- Aditya Singh.'

1118
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,120
'He is experiencing
severe chest pain and heaviness.'

1119
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:22,800
'And he is hemodynamically unstable.'

1120
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,296
'A possible myocardial infarction.'

1121
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,880
'Sam, you saved me
the first time I had an attack.'

1122
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:29,200
'Sam, please do something.'

1123
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,280
'Don't worry, Aditya,
everything will be alright.'

1124
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,360
'Stay with me, pal.'

1125
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:35,200
'Stay with me.'
- Wait.

1126
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,440
Open it nice and well.

1127
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,520
'What the hell! The same pain again.'

1128
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,400
'Don't worry, Adi. You will be fine.'
- That's it.

1129
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:43,840
'You can control it
like you did earlier.'

1130
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,320
'You can do it!'

1131
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,800
Another bone broke.
- He'll be in a lot of pain tomorrow.

1132
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:49,600
Sorry, Adi.

1133
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,320
'Yes, you better be sorry, Sam!'

1134
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:55,680
'The pain won't last long, Adi.'

1135
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:57,600
'We are nearly through.'

1136
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,840
'Sam will fix all this'

1137
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,600
'like he did in the past.'

1138
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:04,960
'Stay with me, pal.
Everything is going to be okay.'

1139
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,160
'I always follow up on my patients.'

1140
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,800
'Especially when I've saved
someone's life. Have a seat.'

1141
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:12,680
'You can thank me.'

1142
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,400
'This is the right time.'

1143
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,320
'How do I thank you?'

1144
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,360
'Well, I prefer cash.'

1145
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,920
'Sam, take me to Ria.'

1146
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:24,800
'Adi, you've a rare heart disease
called EMF.'

1147
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,160
'You need a heart transplant.'

1148
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,056
'Which is fibrosis of heart...
- What are you thinking?'

1149
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,600
'Unfortunately, there's no cure'

1150
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,440
'except a heart transplant.'

1151
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,440
'I love going for the big catch.'

1152
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:37,240
'Do you go fishing? That means you
only like being a millionaire.'

1153
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,680
'You like to eat the fish others
work hard to catch.'

1154
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,680
'Am I right? He is my dad.'

1155
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,840
'She is my mom. Isn't it weird'

1156
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,280
'that a person's entire life'

1157
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,400
'can be summed up on
a small part of a wall?'

1158
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:50,440
'I hope my life'

1159
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,080
'fills the entire wall, at least.'

1160
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:57,440
'Oh God!'

1161
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:00,240
'I miss you, Ria.
- Is this okay?'

1162
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,320
'I love you so much.'

1163
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,920
'I love you and I miss you.'

1164
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,680
'Ria, help me get rid of this pain.'

1165
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,360
'Miss you.'

1166
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:13,080
'Look at me, Ria. Just look at me.'

1167
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,320
'This operation will over soon, Ria.'

1168
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,640
'Very soon, I will be with you.'

1169
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:22,960
'Just pray for me.'

1170
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:24,960
'Ria's memories'

1171
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:28,440
'from the beginning.
- You're rich, handsome, '

1172
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,960
'and honest.'

1173
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:31,560
'Wow!'

1174
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,200
'How is it your fault'

1175
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,480
'that you were born in a rich family?'

1176
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:39,440
'Now it's your turn.'

1177
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,560
'Stay with me. Just stay with me'

1178
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,440
'We are almost there, Ria.'

1179
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,640
'Almost there.'
- The new heart is here, doctor.

1180
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:48,280
It's a beautiful heart.

1181
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:50,280
You're very fortunate.

1182
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:53,000
By the way, I have two tickets
of the IPL game.

1183
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,240
Jenny, care to join me?

1184
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:56,880
No, thanks.

1185
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,840
I don't like cricket.
- What!

1186
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,400
Why?

1187
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:01,960
Hey, Sam.

1188
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,320
Will you come with me?

1189
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,640
I hate cricket.

1190
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,440
What's your problem?

1191
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:12,080
Oh God! Adi's medicines.

1192
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,800
I carry them with me.

1193
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:18,720
Otherwise, he takes them every
half hour like chocolates.

1194
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,480
He could overdose, you know.

1195
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,280
Thank God! He won't need them anymore.

1196
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,840
You care a lot about him, don't you?

1197
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,560
Nice.

1198
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,160
I tried to find reasons

1199
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,240
to not like him,

1200
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,000
to go far away from him.

1201
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,560
Honestly,

1202
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,840
I know how important he is to you.

1203
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,800
What do you want, Ria?

1204
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:49,960
I just want him to be happy.

1205
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:55,320
And it's linked to your happiness.

1206
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,560
He has already lost his dad.

1207
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:03,000
I don't want him to lose you too.

1208
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,920
It's not wrong to love someone,
Mrs Singh.

1209
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,040
And I am not bad.

1210
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:14,880
Please.

1211
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:17,520
Please.

1212
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:22,240
There are some more pills besides these.
- What?

1213
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:25,800
He has some allergies,
especially during summer.

1214
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,840
It's okay.

1215
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,760
Alright.

1216
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,520
Aditya Singh's family?
- Yes.

1217
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,200
Ma'am, his operation has started.

1218
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,880
The two of you should go to
the waiting room on the second floor.

1219
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:43,960
Okay.

1220
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:45,240
He is sleeping comfortably.

1221
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,560
Dr Gupta, you've been working
for a long time.

1222
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:48,800
Why don't you take a break?

1223
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:51,920
Go and have a cup of coffee.
- Oh! That's a good idea.

1224
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,720
I need to make a call.
- No problem.

1225
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,040
We won't need you for half an hour.

1226
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,800
Thanks.

1227
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,560
I will join you soon.

1228
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,320
Sam, what happened? Are you alright?

1229
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:14,800
I can't do it.

1230
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:16,480
But what's the problem?

1231
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:18,560
Patkar.
- Okay.

1232
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:19,920
He messed it up.

1233
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,600
And this new guy, Gupta,

1234
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:23,360
he is keeping an eye on us.

1235
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,800
Oh, come on, Sam. Gupta is an idiot.

1236
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,560
He doesn't know what's happening here.

1237
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:28,880
No.

1238
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:30,840
I think he is spying on us.

1239
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,560
I think he knows everything.

1240
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,920
We kept lowering Adi's position on
the list. - 'What!'

1241
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,920
Have you ever stood near Gupta?

1242
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,280
He's not a spy. He's an alcoholic.

1243
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:41,920
He has a bad hangover.

1244
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,400
Hey! Lower your voice.
He will be here soon.

1245
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,360
Jenny, go and stand guard outside.

1246
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:50,040
And try to find out what
happened to Patkar.

1247
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:53,040
Sam, you're just getting paranoid.
Nobody will come to know anything.

1248
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:56,320
I have planned all this.

1249
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,680
And my instructions will be
followed to the letter.

1250
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:00,440
I don't want to go to jail.

1251
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,640
'Jail! What are you
talking about, Sam?'

1252
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,840
Nobody is going to jail. Inject
the new heart and put it back inside.

1253
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,600
That's all.
- 'What the hell is going on?'

1254
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:10,520
Calm down, Sam. Nobody will have a clue.

1255
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,680
Let's finish all this in an hour

1256
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:13,960
and then have a few drinks.

1257
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:16,000
He will be dead by the time
Gupta returns.

1258
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:17,400
'I'll be dead!'

1259
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,080
'Oh my God, Adi!'

1260
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,000
I don't know why I get a feeling
that Gupta is watching us.

1261
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:23,640
Come on, Sam.
- Come on, Sam.

1262
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:26,440
'Mom! Ria! Save me!'

1263
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,520
I am very tense.

1264
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,760
Why are they taking so much time?

1265
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,160
I'll go and check.
- I'll come with you.

1266
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,880
No, you stay here.

1267
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:43,640
Okay, darling, love you.

1268
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,440
Hey!

1269
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,200
Sam!

1270
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,400
Sam, why do you want to kill me?

1271
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:51,960
Why?

1272
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:53,360
I am warning you, guys.

1273
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,480
If he gets suspicious,

1274
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:59,480
I'll cancel the plan immediately.
I swear, I am not kidding.

1275
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,000
Come off it, Sam.

1276
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,080
Excuse me.
- Yes?

1277
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,400
Do you know what's the status
of the operation?

1278
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,080
The heart transplant.

1279
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,800
Aditya Singh?
- Yes.

1280
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,680
Oh, he is doing fine.
Everything is going as planned.

1281
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:17,360
Is it?

1282
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:19,040
Yes, I am coming from there.

1283
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:21,880
Any problem?

1284
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,880
But you don't seem to be a doctor here.

1285
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:28,320
I mean you don't work at this hospital.

1286
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,320
Oh! I am Dr Shashank Gupta.

1287
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,920
I am Aditya's anaesthetist.
Pleasure meeting you.

1288
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:36,160
Just excuse me.

1289
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:38,920
Patkar is down with laryngitis

1290
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,440
that's why I replaced him.
I'm from St Mary's hospital. - Oh!

1291
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:42,600
Ria.

1292
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:45,560
Ria!

1293
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:48,280
Ria.

1294
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,680
Ria, save me please. Listen to me.

1295
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:52,360
They want to kill me.

1296
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,040
Sam is not my friend. Ria, listen to me.

1297
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:59,320
Oh! No, everything is fine.

1298
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,480
Give her a kiss from my side.

1299
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,240
And tell him I will be home soon.

1300
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,160
Ria, ask them.
- What's going on here?

1301
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:13,360
Why is it taking so much time?

1302
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:17,000
What did I do?

1303
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:20,000
What harm had Ria caused you?
Why are you doing this?

1304
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,920
Ria, what are you doing here? You
shouldn't be in the operation theatre.

1305
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,720
I just came here to see
what's happening.

1306
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:27,400
I was getting worried.

1307
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,480
Is everything okay?
- Yes. Everything is fine.

1308
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,360
Ria, he is lying.

1309
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:35,400
Really? I spoke to some guy named Gupta.

1310
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,840
Our regular anaesthetist Patkar
couldn't make it,

1311
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:40,080
Gupta is his replacement
from St Mary's hospital.

1312
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,760
But you don't have to worry.
Everything is alright.

1313
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:43,960
Don't trust him.

1314
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,280
He is lying. He is trying to kill me.

1315
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:47,880
Are you sure everything is alright?

1316
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,720
But, of course.
Everything is under control.

1317
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,920
Bullshit!
- That's it. Come on, baby. Yes!

1318
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,280
What's going on here?

1319
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,480
Why isn't Patkar here?

1320
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:00,520
I spoke to him. He is at home.

1321
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,680
He is at home?
- Yes.

1322
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:06,400
He backed down.
- Backed down!

1323
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:08,040
What do you mean he backed down?

1324
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,480
Yes, ask him.

1325
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:12,480
Anyway, I hope Gupta
doesn't suspect anything.

1326
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:15,200
No. Not at all.

1327
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:17,120
What about Adi's mom?

1328
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,600
Are you mad? A few minutes ago,
she was in tears and hugging me.

1329
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:23,720
She is under control.
Please get her a gown quickly.

1330
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:27,560
But what about Gupta?
- Don't worry about him.

1331
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:30,000
He is a drunkard. He won't be here
for another half an hour.

1332
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,360
Sam, we need to put him
on bypass quickly.

1333
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,840
Ria, it was my plan.

1334
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,960
I can back out whenever I want.

1335
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,320
Sam, you can't back out.

1336
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:57,960
We have worked on this for a year.

1337
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:00,960
I changed my name and my life.

1338
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,480
It's all clear.

1339
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:04,160
Nothing will happen to us.

1340
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,560
And the toughest part has
already been done.

1341
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,720
He married me.

1342
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,200
'He is Prakash, the second witness.
- Hi.'

1343
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,960
'Are you a doctor too?
- Yes.'

1344
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:18,080
'Sorry, I am late.'

1345
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:19,760
'I was buying a wedding gift for you.'

1346
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:21,400
'I am Jenny.
- Nice to meet you.'

1347
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,496
'They knew each other.
- Nice to meet you too. Congrats.'

1348
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,440
'Jenny.
- Thank you very much.'

1349
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,360
'They were in cahoots
with each other.'

1350
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,280
'What are you thinking?'

1351
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:32,800
'I don't believe this.'

1352
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:40,520
Sam, why did you make this plan?

1353
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,680
You're in debt.

1354
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:46,160
This is the only way
to pay off your debt.

1355
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:57,640
'Sam is my friend, mom.'

1356
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:01,320
'No doctor would care more
for my life than him.'

1357
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:05,480
Ria, I can't kill him.

1358
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,840
Then get ready to die.

1359
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:11,440
Your creditors are not
as amicable as you.

1360
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:13,920
They won't hesitate to kill you.

1361
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,680
You have no option, Sam.

1362
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,240
Just face it.

1363
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:20,160
Ria, it's just money.

1364
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:22,520
He is my friend.

1365
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,200
If I ask him, he will give me the money.

1366
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:28,760
Sam, don't talk nonsense!
- Hey, listen to me.

1367
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:31,240
It was my idea.

1368
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,240
He came to me first.

1369
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:35,720
I got all of you involved.

1370
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:37,520
I sent you to Dubai.

1371
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:39,920
I called her mom here

1372
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,840
so that you can entrap him.

1373
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:47,800
'Yes, tell me. - Hello, Mrs Singh. I am
calling from Parulkar Heart Institute.'

1374
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,440
'We have found a donor.
Can you come here tomorrow?'

1375
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:53,960
'But I am in Dubai and I've a very
important meeting tomorrow morning.'

1376
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,096
'Ma'am, we have found a donor
with great difficulty.'

1377
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:57,760
'You won't get such
an opportunity again.'

1378
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:00,320
Had he died before you get married,
my plan would have failed.

1379
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,040
Absolutely.

1380
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:03,800
Had I been in your place,

1381
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:06,280
I would have married him
before leaving Dubai.

1382
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:07,800
Really?

1383
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:09,936
But it would have happened
only if you hadn't got pregnant

1384
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:11,560
with your boyfriend's child, Jenny.

1385
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:13,120
So just get lost.

1386
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:18,000
Sam, you're getting emotional now.

1387
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:20,960
But you'll need money in a few days.

1388
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:22,960
And you're going to regret this.

1389
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:26,321
You won't earn such a lot even
if you conduct surgeries all your life.

1390
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:28,800
We stand to get millions.

1391
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,400
Even after distributing the
amount equally between

1392
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:33,640
the five of us, you will
have more than enough.

1393
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:36,800
Besides, it's a case of transplant.

1394
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:40,560
Such patients die within a few years.

1395
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:45,880
You're right.

1396
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,360
Such patients die within a few years.

1397
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:08,920
No!

1398
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:13,880
No!

1399
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,680
Come on, Sam. Let's move.
Pass the new heart.

1400
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,240
But I haven't injected it.

1401
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:33,440
Then do it, Sam.
We don't have time. Damn it!

1402
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:36,360
Where is the syringe?
- Over there.

1403
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:38,760
Give it to me.
- Ria, what are you doing?

1404
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:41,800
Come on move your bloody hand.

1405
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,480
Sam, take the syringe, inject it,

1406
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:45,920
and put it back in.

1407
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:48,320
Sam, it was your idea.

1408
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:50,840
So finish it what you began.

1409
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:52,920
Just do it, Sam.

1410
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:57,640
He loves you a lot.

1411
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,000
Love!

1412
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:03,520
He doesn't even know me.

1413
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:05,840
We have never met.

1414
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:10,920
Wait. Hold on.

1415
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:13,240
Ria, don't.

1416
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,080
Now, put it in.

1417
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:26,320
Sorry, baby.

1418
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:55,520
Mrs Singh.

1419
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:56,960
Is Adi alright?

1420
01:32:57,320 --> 01:33:00,081
They didn't tell me anything.
- But you were in there for a long time.

1421
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:08,760
Ria,

1422
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:10,720
I am very scared.

1423
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,240
Well, guys, how's everything?

1424
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,360
Everything is fine. Forceps.

1425
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,520
Hey, you guys seem to be in hurry.
- Dr Gupta,

1426
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:20,960
look what's happening with me.

1427
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,640
Dr Gupta, look at me.

1428
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,160
There is something wrong with me!
Look at my eyes!

1429
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:28,960
Please look at my eyes! I am crying!

1430
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,080
Dr Gupta, look at me!

1431
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:34,040
Just a minute. Stop.
- Yes, Dr Gupta.

1432
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:41,840
I can't go to the IPL game tomorrow.

1433
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:44,680
I forgot that I've to take
my wife to dinner tomorrow.

1434
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:46,360
Dr Rathore,

1435
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:47,840
I'll give you both the tickets.

1436
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,520
Take your girlfriend to the game.
She will be very happy.

1437
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:03,880
Something is wrong.

1438
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:06,040
I can feel it.

1439
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:07,960
I can't just sit here doing nothing.

1440
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:10,520
Calm down. Don't worry.

1441
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,680
Everything is going to be fine.

1442
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,800
I can't live without him.

1443
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:22,640
Pressure down.

1444
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:34,720
'She knew where I kept my pills.'

1445
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:37,760
'Do you think I am for sale? Here.'

1446
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:40,560
'She threw away a ring worth 10 dollars
and became a billionaire.'

1447
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,640
'Adi, you're such a fool.'

1448
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:51,440
Ria, I hope you're happy.

1449
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,200
There is something wrong.
He is fibbing.

1450
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:57,640
He is fibbing!

1451
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:59,280
Wait a minute. What do we do, Sam?

1452
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:00,960
Start de-fibrillation.

1453
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:03,720
Make it 60 joules.
- Paddle to 60 joules.

1454
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:08,040
'I can't trust a run-of-the-mill
doctor with your life.'

1455
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:10,720
'He is my friend, mom.
I trust him implicitly.'

1456
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,760
'The problem is that
you don't trust me.'

1457
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,440
'I am so sorry, mom.'

1458
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:34,120
'The number you're calling...'

1459
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,600
'Everything was happening
right in front of me, '

1460
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,360
'but I had no clue.'

1461
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:42,760
'How could I have known?'

1462
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:46,240
'I was busy looking at you.'

1463
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,720
Charge once again.

1464
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:51,080
Paddle charge. Charge released.
- Clear.

1465
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:52,560
Charge.

1466
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:55,200
Clear.
- Give it to me. Let me charge it.

1467
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:57,400
Come on, Adi!

1468
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:00,200
We are losing him.

1469
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:02,240
No, let me give it another try, please.

1470
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:07,080
It's over, Sam.

1471
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:09,240
We need to put him on bypass.

1472
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:11,040
What about adrenaline?

1473
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:12,840
It's pointless.

1474
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:15,400
Let me try one shot of it. Please.

1475
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:16,960
Come on, Adi!

1476
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:19,520
Come on!
- It won't work. It's over.

1477
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:21,360
Are you sure, Dr Gupta, there is no air?

1478
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:22,720
Yes, there is no air.

1479
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:24,800
I can see it.
- Oh, come on, Adi!

1480
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,320
Adi!

1481
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:29,160
I'm sorry, sir.

1482
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,720
It's all my fault.

1483
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:43,120
No, Sam, it's not your fault.

1484
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:44,440
Oh, come on.

1485
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:46,400
I should have done something.

1486
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:48,600
Sam, you did whatever you could.

1487
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:50,960
Oh, really?
- Yes, Sam.

1488
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:54,520
It wasn't the right heart.

1489
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:58,560
We need to inform his family.

1490
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:00,160
Who will tell them?

1491
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:01,760
I will tell them.

1492
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:04,480
I should do this.

1493
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,160
I will come with you.

1494
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:19,960
Sorry, Gayatri.

1495
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:21,880
His body rejected the heart.

1496
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:24,200
We tried a lot,

1497
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:27,000
but the organ failed.

1498
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:29,120
I am so sorry.

1499
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:32,280
The organ failed!

1500
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:34,400
More often than not, in such cases...
- You...

1501
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:36,880
You have failed.

1502
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:41,880
No. We tried our best,

1503
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:44,160
but the procedure...
- Say it.

1504
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:45,840
What?
- Tell me.

1505
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:50,440
I want to hear you say that you failed.

1506
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,600
You couldn't save my son.

1507
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:55,320
I knew you shouldn't have
performed the surgery.

1508
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:57,400
You shouldn't have been here.

1509
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:02,920
Sorry, Mrs Singh.

1510
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:09,200
I knew it.
- Mrs Singh.

1511
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:13,600
So sorry.

1512
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:18,040
Adi, I am so sorry.

1513
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,640
I am so sorry.

1514
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,360
Adi, sorry.
- I am sorry, ma'am,

1515
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:29,320
but we need your permission,

1516
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:32,920
to remove Aditya from the bypass.

1517
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,040
My permission?
- Yes.

1518
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:40,080
We need your signature to
take Aditya off the bypass.

1519
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:45,120
I don't get it.

1520
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:47,960
Is he alive?

1521
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:50,640
Yes, technically.

1522
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:53,120
But a machine is pumping the blood.

1523
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:56,000
He doesn't have a heart.

1524
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:58,520
Then, get another heart.

1525
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:00,600
You don't understand.

1526
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:02,600
His blood group is rare.

1527
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:05,440
It's very difficult to get
another heart at this time.

1528
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:07,320
I am sorry.

1529
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:08,960
It's over.

1530
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,320
No, it's not.

1531
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:16,160
It's not over.

1532
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:19,320
Something can be done.
- Mother.

1533
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:22,560
I want to

1534
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:24,640
stay alone for a while.

1535
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:26,600

How could I leave you alone?

1561
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:55,320
I left you alone once.

1562
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:57,960
And see what happened.

1563
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:12,680
Mom.

1564
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:16,280
How can we see each other?

1565
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:19,040
How can we hear each other?

1566
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:26,640
Oh my God!

1567
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:28,600
Mom,

1568
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:30,320
what did you do?

1569
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:32,240
How?

1570
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,360
'Gayatri, it's impossible.'

1571
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:38,280
'It's a crazy plan.'

1572
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:40,440
'Do you know what you are saying?'

1573
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:42,360
'I don't...'

1574
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:46,360
I' can't do this.
- Sanjeev.'

1575
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:49,200
'Think like a doctor, '

1576
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,760
'not a friend.'

1577
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:57,320
'I am donating my heart to someone,
who needs it the most.'

1578
01:45:57,480 --> 01:45:59,000
'Gayatri, this is suicide!'

1579
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:00,760
'I won't let you do it!'

1580
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:03,680
'And you know that
even if you commit suicide, '

1581
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:05,840
'I won't perform the surgery.'

1582
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:07,720
'This is a murder!'

1583
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:09,840
'This is not murder.'

1584
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:13,160
'What happened inside
the operation theatre was murder.'

1585
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:16,360
'You have to do this...'

1586
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:18,880
'For me.

1587
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:21,360
'Are you listening? Gayatri!'

1588
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:23,280
'Gayatri!'

1589
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,680
You were right about Ria.

1590
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,040
She betrayed me.

1591
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:38,960
I know.

1592
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:40,960
How did you come to know about Ria?

1593
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:43,080
When Trehan told me over the phone

1594
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:44,680
that he had seen Ria somewhere...

1595
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:49,320
'You...'
- He had seen Ria in Abu Dhabi with Sam

1596
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:51,440
at a medical convention.

1597
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:53,480
She was a member of his team.

1598
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:55,800
And then,

1599
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:58,880
when your medicines fell from her bag,

1600
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:00,920
I became more suspicious.

1601
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:03,720
Ria did everything cleverly.

1602
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:06,080
But she made one mistake.

1603
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:08,520
She left her bag with me.

1604
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,440
'And when I opened her bag, '

1605
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:14,000
'I found her correspondence
with the medical college'

1606
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:15,680
'where she was a junior doctor.'

1607
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:18,240
'I also found some credit cards'

1608
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:20,440
'in the name of Shruti Tandon.'

1609
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:22,800
I feel so bad.

1610
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:25,240
I always considered Dr Trehan wrong.

1611
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,040
Gayatri!

1612
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:35,320
Gayatri!

1613
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,480
Oh God!

1614
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:41,320
Prepare for the operation!

1615
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:43,560
Send me the stretcher immediately!
- Yes, sir.

1616
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:51,200
Dr Trehan,

1617
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:54,520
I tried hard to save him, but...

1618
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:56,840
I know how hard you tried.

1619
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:57,960
Just get out of here.

1620
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:00,280
The police are on their way.
- Come on, guys.

1621
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:03,040
Come on, Sam, let's go.
- Come on, Sam, let's get going.

1622
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:10,000
Come back, Adi.

1623
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:12,400
Please.

1624
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:15,240
I am so sorry.

1625
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:22,960
Dr Sameer Saxena,

1626
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:26,080
it's due to doctors like you

1627
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:28,520
that the entire medical fraternity
is infamous.

1628
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:37,720
'Remove my heart after I die, '

1629
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:39,960
'it belongs to someone else.'

1630
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:42,320
'Make sure it doesn't burn with me.'

1631
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:43,680
Gayatri,

1632
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:46,960
this is the most difficult moment
of my life.

1633
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:51,960
I will never forgive you for this.

1634
01:48:57,880 --> 01:48:59,000
Sam.

1635
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:05,560
Ria, it's all over.

1636
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:08,240
You must leave.

1637
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:10,880
The police will be here any moment now.

1638
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:14,760
Sam, I don't need to go anywhere.

1639
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:17,200
I married him.

1640
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,480
Remember? I am his widow.

1641
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:23,080
I will still get my share.

1642
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:25,440
What!

1643
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:28,120
But he is alive, Ria.

1644
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:30,240
He isn't dead.

1645
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:32,760
If he hasn't died, he will soon.

1646
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:29,760
Excuse me, Mrs Singh.

1647
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:32,440
Just a minute.

1648
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:35,800
Okay. Cut it.

1649
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:38,240
Congratulations, sir.

1650
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:40,040
Well done.
- Great job, sir.

1651
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:40,920
Thank you, sir.

1652
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,360
Well done.

1653
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:45,600
Oh my God!

1654
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:47,160
He is sinking.

1655
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:48,960
Start DE-fibrillation!

1656
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:51,200
Quick!
- Clear.

1657
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:53,600
Not responding.
- Make it 150 joules.

1658
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:55,080
Clear.
- 200 joules.

1659
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:57,840
200 joules!
- 200 joules. Clear.

1660
01:50:58,440 --> 01:50:59,760
It's about time, Adi.

1661
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:03,840
You should go now.

1662
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:07,440
No, mom.

1663
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:10,920
I don't want to go back.

1664
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:15,320
First, I lost dad.

1665
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:18,600
And now I have lost you.

1666
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:22,680
Sam and Ria betrayed me.

1667
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:25,960
No, Adi.

1668
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:27,800
Don't say that.

1669
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,480
Every person has his own journey.

1670
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:36,480
Just being with someone for a while

1671
01:51:37,160 --> 01:51:39,000
doesn't mean you go on the same journey.

1672
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:42,760
Until now we were together.

1673
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:44,320
We were with each other.

1674
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:47,680
But now you need to
embark upon your journey.

1675
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:50,640
That's what life is all about.

1676
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,600
I don't want such a life.

1677
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:00,240
I want to be with you.

1678
01:52:03,240 --> 01:52:04,800
I won't go back.

1679
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:07,440
You don't get it, Adi.

1680
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:10,080
Even if you don't go back,

1681
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,680
you can't be with me.

1682
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:17,040
We were meant to be together
only for so long.

1683
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:20,720
Clear.

1684
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:23,840
No... No response.
- Clear.

1685
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:26,440
I want to show you something.

1686
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:29,760
Adi.
- 'Dad, I want to sail the boat too.'

1687
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:34,400
'I want you to stop blaming yourself'

1688
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:37,240
'for your dad's death.'

1689
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:39,720
'How long will you hold him, Gayatri?'

1690
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:42,320
'Let him live his life.'

1691
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:44,440
'Come, Adi.
- It was an accident.'

1692
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:46,640
'Just an accident.'

1693
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:49,080
'Come my brave-heart. Sit here.
- It was not your fault.'

1694
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:50,720
'Now you're the captain of the boat.'

1695
01:52:51,480 --> 01:52:52,480
'Do what you want.'

1696
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:55,040
'Vikram, don't make him sit
so close to the bow. I am scared.'

1697
01:52:55,120 --> 01:52:56,400
'Relax, Gayatri.'

1698
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:00,960
'No, it's too fast.
- He will be fine.'

1699
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:02,720
'Adi!'

1700
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:04,520
'Dad, save me!
- Adi!'

1701
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:07,920
'Dad, help me!
- Adi!'

1702
01:53:08,160 --> 01:53:09,680
'Adi!'

1703
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:12,600
'Adi!
- Help me.'

1704
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:14,280
'Vikram, save him!'

1705
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:19,760
'Dad, I am drowning! Save me!'

1706
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:23,720
'Vikram!'

1707
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:28,280
'Hold him!'

1708
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:30,200
'Adi, go.
Adi, come on! Come up!'

1709
01:53:34,840 --> 01:53:36,680
'Vikram!
- Gayatri!'

1710
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:39,560
'No!
- Gayatri!'

1711
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:42,800
'Dad!
- Vikram!'

1712
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:51,040
'I am sorry, dad. Please forgive me.'

1713
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:52,640
'I am responsible for this.'

1714
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:55,760
Your dad sacrificed his life
to save you.

1715
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:58,160
You need to go back, Adi.

1716
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:02,160
Every mother give birth
to her child once,

1717
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:05,800
but I am the most fortunate of all,

1718
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:10,200
for getting a chance
to give birth to you once again.

1719
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:14,040
Don't take this away from me.

1720
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:17,920
You've to go back.

1721
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:26,600
'I still remember the vent
in that small room'

1722
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:30,520
'from where the moonlight used to
filter into the room.'

1723
01:54:32,680 --> 01:54:35,040
'I used to sleep on mom's lap, '

1724
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:39,600
'when she would sing a lullaby.'
- My son.

1725
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:43,120
'I lost that childhood somewhere'

1726
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:45,600
'when I grew up.'

1727
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:48,880
'Today, I feel a lump in my throat'

1728
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:52,080
'when I recall those moments.'

1729
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:56,360
'Tears roll down my eyes as I wonder
why mom doesn't scold me anymore.'

1730
01:54:58,120 --> 01:54:59,560
'Have your food on time.'

1731
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:02,200
'Come home early.'

1732
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:04,920
'Why doesn't she say that?'

1733
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:08,080
'Where am I?'

1734
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:10,640
'Why did I go away from mom?'

1735
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:14,360
'Why do I feel so helpless?'

1736
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:17,600
'Today, my sorrow knows no bounds.'

1737
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:21,360
'The small wound has become incurable.'

1738
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:25,400
'I will fall asleep recalling
her stories, '

1739
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:29,560
'and her loving pats on my head.'

1740
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:32,640
'It seems as if'

1741
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:35,040
'mom will come to me.'

1742
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:37,560
'She will embrace me.'

1743
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:41,160
'And she will take me
to the world of angels.'

1744
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:44,120
'Where there will be a king.'

1745
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:46,480
'And a queen.'

1746
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:49,440
'A a new story will end.'

1747
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:53,800
'Mom will go back quietly.'

1748
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:56,760
'I know'

1749
01:55:58,280 --> 01:56:00,040
'mom won't come back.'

1750
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:45,040
Congratulations, Adi.

1751
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:48,480
Welcome back.

1752
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:08,840
Adi!

1753
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:11,480
Adi!

1754
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:15,920
Adi, my sweetheart.

1755
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:19,400
Thank God you are here.

1756
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:21,520
I was so worried for you.

1757
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:25,240
As soon as I got the news of
your discharge from the hospital,

1758
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:26,720
I went to your house.

1759
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:28,960
But I got to know that you're here.

1760
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:32,360
I missed you so much.

1761
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:41,840
I heard about mother.

1762
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:44,560
I am so sorry.

1763
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:48,400
She was very happy for us.

1764
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:54,040
We became quite close
when we were in the hospital.

1765
01:57:55,240 --> 01:57:56,480
I miss her.

1766
01:57:57,080 --> 01:57:59,760
Had she been here,
she wouldn't have let them arrest me.

1767
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:01,280
Can you imagine?

1768
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:03,000
Sam did all that.

1769
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:06,400
I mean, he was so close to you.
He was your friend.

1770
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:08,320
How could he?

1771
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:11,000
And now he refuses to
cooperate with the police.

1772
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:13,840
They arrested me too because of him.

1773
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:15,800
But they didn't have evidence.

1774
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:20,040
Thanks to the Governor
who stood surety for me,

1775
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,640
otherwise I wouldn't have got bail.

1776
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:26,000
Now that you have recovered,

1777
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:27,960
everything will be fine.

1778
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:32,560
Everything will be okay, right?

1779
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:38,880
Adi, I hope

1780
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:41,080
you don't think I was involved...

1781
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:46,040
Of course not.

1782
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:49,960
Ria, I know everything.

1783
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:53,000
I heard everything
in the operation theatre.

1784
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:55,080
I seemed to be unconscious,

1785
01:58:56,360 --> 01:58:57,800
but I was wide awake.

1786
01:58:59,120 --> 01:59:00,320
Anaesthesia Awareness.

1787
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:02,640
You would know about it.

1788
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:05,040
After all, you were a doctor

1789
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:06,600
on Sam's team.

1790
01:59:11,160 --> 01:59:13,200
What do you know?

1791
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:14,400
You don't know anything.

1792
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:16,200
People like you don't
know the difference

1793
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:17,880
between staying alive and living it up.

1794
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:20,280
You didn't even want to live.

1795
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:22,120
I taught you how to live.

1796
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:23,640
Adi, you were dead.

1797
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:26,560
I only tried to kill someone
who was already dead.

1798
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:29,680
Besides, what proof do you have?

1799
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:31,840
Who will believe you?

1800
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:33,680
People think you were unconscious.

1801
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:38,960
'There are some crimes
that cannot be pardoned.'

1802
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:42,520
'I have got the punishment I deserved.'

1803
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:45,920
'I could have got Ria punished as well, '

1804
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:48,960
'but I want you to do it.'

1805
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:51,040
'I am sending you the proof.'

1806
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:54,240
'Forgive me if you can. Sam.'

1807
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:10,040
Adi, please don't send me back to jail.

1808
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:12,520
Adi, you love me. Please.

1809
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:14,360
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

1810
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:17,240
Ria, I would have forgiven you,

1811
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:20,160
but you destroyed the heart

1812
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:22,560
that was in love with you.

1813
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:26,000
And I have my mom's heart now.

1814
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:28,400
Think about it.

1815
02:00:29,480 --> 02:00:31,240
Can my mom ever forgive you?

1816
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:42,480
Adi! Please!

1817
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:45,240
Leave me.

1818
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:47,600
Adi, forgive me.
