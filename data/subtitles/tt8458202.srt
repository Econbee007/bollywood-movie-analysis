00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,830
Wake up, please.

2
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,950
Mummy, I want water.

3
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,500
Mummy...

4
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,330
Mummy.

5
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,500
Mamma, where is papa?

6
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,080
Mamma, let's go outside.

7
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,910
Mamma I'm coming, okay.

9
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,040
Papa.

10
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,700
Papa!

11
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,660
Papa!

12
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,000
Papa!

13
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,700
One...

14
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,580
Two...

15
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,870

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,620
Four...

17
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,950
Eight...

18
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,200
Three... four...

19
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,870
Six...

20
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,870
Eight.

21
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,080
Nine... ten...

22
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,700
Nineteen.

23
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
Papa!

24
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:48,910
Papa!

25
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,160
Mamma I can't reach up there.

26
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,700
Bapu!

27
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,500
One... two... three...

28
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,040
Mamma...

29
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,620
Mamma, the water is running.

30
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,250
The water is running.

31
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,830
Mamma, dancing.

32
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,620
Mamma, dancing.

33
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,750
Mamma, dancing.

34
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,120
Come, Mamma.

35
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,660
Mamma, come.

36
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,910
Mamma, today's paper.

37
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,000
Paper.

38
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,910
Bapu's photo is torn.

39
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,700
Mamma... Bapu.

40
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,700
I want to play on the swing.

41
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,450
Mamma, get up, please!

42
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,200
Mummy.

43
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,870
Mamma, get up, please.

44
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,700
Please come Mamma..

45
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,500
Mummy.

46
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,660
Mamma..

47
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,080
Mamma..

48
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,410
Mamma, this is your daily soap.

49
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,160
Come, Mamma.

50
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,700
Watch TV.

51
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,410
Come, Mamma.

52
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,450
Come, Mamma.

53
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,580
Come on, Mamma.

54
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,290
Mamma.

55
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,870
Come, Mamma.

56
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,160
Mamma, get up.

57
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,200
Mummy...

58
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,080
Mummy.

59
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,450
Mummy.

60
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,250
Mummy.

61
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,160
Mamma.

62
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,870
Phone...

63
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,540
Mamma, where is the phone?

64
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,290
Mamma, I want to do potty.

65
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,910
Mamma.

66
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,290
Mamma.

67
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,160
Potty on my finger.

68
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,200
Phone.

69
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,000
The phone is ringing.

70
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,160
The phone is ringing.

71
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,870
Mamma, phone.

72
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,250
Hello.

73
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,750
Phone.

74
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,500
Papa's slippers are wet.

75
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,290
Mamma, papa's slippers are wet.

76
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,750
Take it, Mummy.

77
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,620
Mummy.

78
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,660
Mummy, take it.

79
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,040
Mummy.

80
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
Oh ho.

81
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,410
Mummy. Mummy.

82
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,000
Pihu is naked.

83
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,870
Mamma help Pihu wear pajamas.

84
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,120
Mamma.

85
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,620
Mamma.

86
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,040
Mamma, what is this?

87
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,620
Mamma, see medicines.

88
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,200
Mamma, can I eat this?

89
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,250
Mamma, see medicines.

90
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,910
Look, Mamma.

91
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,700
Mamma.

92
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,000
Mamma, can I eat this?

93
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,870
Can I eat this?

94
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,290
Phone.

95
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,160
Mamma.

96
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,580
Mamma, phone.

97
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,040
Oh...

98
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,540
Chucking the phone
won't prove anything, Puja.

99
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,750
Mummy.

100
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,500
Why don't you get some help?

101
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,370
Idiot! You've made my life hell.

102
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,120
Actually, I'm not interested in
talking to you either. Understand?

103
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,790
I just called to say...

104
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,080
that I'm going to miss
my flight again because of you.

105
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,790
You didn't pack my bags
or iron my clothes.

106
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,330
You knew I had an
important meeting in Kolkata.

107
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,750
What difference does it make to you?

108
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,040
Even if someone's
flying out in the morning...

109
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,700
you still want to butt heads.

110
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,620
Hello. Puja?

111
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,950
Are you listening?

112
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,700
Mummy.

113
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,870
Okay.

114
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,830
Just go to hell!

115
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,290
And listen, I forgot to turn
off the iron in a hurry.

116
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,620
And it's entirely your fault.

117
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,750
You females are the
worst thing in any man's life!

118
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,370
Whether you live or die...

119
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,540
I don't care about you at all.

120
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,200
But Pihu's at home.

121
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,660
So see to it that you turn it off.

122
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,750
And what's wrong with Pihu?
Why is she crying?

123
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,040
Hello. Pihu.

124
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,410
- Hello.
- Papa.

125
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,870
Pihu.

126
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:39,750
- Pihu my love.
- Papa, mamma is here only.

127
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,790
Papa, I am coming. Yes, dear...

128
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:47,410
Papa is going to Kolkata. Hello.

129
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,700
Pihu.

130
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,370
My love. Give papa a kiss.

131
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,500
Come on.

132
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,370
Okay, bye.

133
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,660
Hello, Puja.

134
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,080
Hello.

135
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,790
Damn it!

136
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,160
Mamma is hurt.

137
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,500
Mamma needs cream.

138
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,870
Mamma, where is the cream?

139
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:38,120
Gaurav, I fought with my folks to
marry you, but what did I get from you?

140
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:44,950
You said, you'll return
home only after I'm dead

141
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,540
I am going away

142
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:53,250
I wanted to take Pihu along,
but I didn't have the guts to do it.

143
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,120
Goodbye - Puja.

144
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:26,580
Look at me now.

145
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,040
Mummy.

146
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:29,160
Look, the peacock took the peahen away.
What little was left, the thief took away.

147
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:39,750
Stop being angry, let's get back to play,
cheer up girl, throw all sadness away.

148
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,660
Mamma, sing the rhyme for me.

149
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,040
This is my cream. These are my hands.

150
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,080
See my hands.

151
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,870
What do I have in my hands?

152
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:12,080
Cream. Look Mamma, cream on my hands.

153
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,000
See, Mamma.

154
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,790
Mamma, smoke.

155
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,080
Mamma, where is the smoke coming from?

156
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,120
Mamma, can I turn this off?

157
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,120
How did it happen?

158
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,200
Mamma, where is the smoke coming from?

159
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,750
Mamma!

160
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,750
Mummy!

161
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:33,700
Mummy!

162
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,950
Mamma, I want milk.

163
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,620
Get up, Mamma.

164
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,870
Please get up.

165
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,540
Mamma!

166
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,290
Oh no...

167
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,330
Oh no...

168
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,910
One. Two. Three. Four.

169
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,540
Pihu's bread.

170
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,790
Stop. Please.

171
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,080
Mummy!

172
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,950
Mamma!

173
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,700
Any trash?

174
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,750
Madam, any trash?

175
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,290
Pihu is coming.

176
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,580
I am eating jam.

177
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,330
Wait, I am coming.

178
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:00,910
Eat... come on, eat.

179
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,500
You must eat your food...

180
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,500
Eat.

181
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,750
Eat...

182
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,330
Mummy..

183
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:14,120
Mummy, you must eat.

184
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:27,410
Go on, eat. Take...

185
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:28,950
Come on, eat.

186
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,370
Eat.

187
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:50,750
One-two-three.

188
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,160
One-two-three.

189
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,330
One-two-three.

190
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,160
One-two-three.

191
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,450
One-two-three.

192
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,580
One-two-three.

193
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,080
What are you saying?

194
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,000
Bomb, Bomb, Bomb.

195
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,040
Mummy.

196
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:32,950
Hello.

197
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:33,910
Hello.

198
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:34,950
Hello.

199
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,700
Pihu, - Hello, papa.

200
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:39,290
Baby, where is Mamma.
Give the phone to Mamma.

201
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,700
Mamma. Papa's phone.

202
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,370
What happened, mamma?

203
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:45,040
Puja.

204
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,080
- I've boarded the airplane.
- Excuse me, sir.

205
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:48,950
I'm calling from
the airplane's toilet.

206
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,160
My phone will be switched
off for two hours.

207
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,790
I just wanted to ask whether
you turned off the iron or not?

208
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,250
You know that...

209
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:57,636
- the iron's automatic function isn't working.
- 'Excuse me, sir.'

210
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,750
Hello.

211
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,120
Hello, Puja. Talk to me.

212
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,080
- Excuse me, sir.
- Hello.

213
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,500
Excuse me, sir.

214
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,950
Please come out, sir.

215
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,766
- Phones are not allowed, sir.
- That's the problem with you.

216
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,750
You have a very short temper.

217
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,870
Fine, I admit I was late yesterday.

218
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,790
I couldn't be on time
for Pihu's birthday.

219
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:15,790
But did we have to
argue over it all night?

220
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,790
- Switch off your phone sir.
- Yeah, just two minutes.

221
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,306
And why did you drag
Meera in our argument?

222
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:23,120
Who the hell is Meera between us?

223
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,080
You know she's just a colleague.

224
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:27,500
And she's your friend, not mine.

225
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,870
Phones are not allowed, sir.

226
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,000
- Please, sir.
- Hello.

227
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,700
Hello.

228
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,080
Hello.

229
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,750
Hello...

230
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:40,330
Hello!

231
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,250
Mamma, the phone's turned off.

232
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,950
This is Pihu's phone.

233
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:16,580
Mummy.

234
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,410
Uff...

235
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:08,750
Madam, milk.

236
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:10,500
Wait, coming.

237
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,830
Pinky, call the guard.

238
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:18,450
These guys at 903 are driving me nuts.

239
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,290
What do you want? Hello, madam.

240
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:21,620
- Guard!
- What's the matter?

241
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,726
- Guard!
- None of the doorbells are working, madam?

242
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:24,910
No electricity?

243
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,160
The generator's getting fixed.

244
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:29,226
Power supply will be restored soon.

245
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:30,290
See, power's back.

246
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,410
I just wanted to know...

247
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,886
What did you break this time, Pinky?

248
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:34,410
Have the people in 804 gone out?

249
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,660
I had brought cow's
milk for the child.

250
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,926
- But no one's opening the door.
- How the hell would I know?

251
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:40,250
Check with the guard. Go.

252
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:44,160
They kept partying all night.
I couldn't sleep a wink.

253
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:46,330
Are they still sleeping? At this hour?

254
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:47,830
How would I know?

255
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:49,450
That is not our problem.

256
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,580
Pinky!

257
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,120
- I thought since you're their neighbor,
- Pinky!

258
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:54,370
You would know.

259
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:55,700
What neighbor!

260
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:57,266
We didn't even get
invited to the party.

261
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:59,700
Damn you!

262
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:04,500
Madam, can you please
hand over this milk to them?

263
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:07,660
Go give it to the people in 705.

264
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,870
Such a temper is not good

265
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:15,120
I am only doing my job.
You didn't have to yell at me.

266
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:04,660
Mummy!

267
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,830
Guard. Guard.

268
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:53,870
Yes.

269
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,580
See what's the commotion all about.

270
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,500
This place is not
fit to live in anymore.

271
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,830
- Okay, I'll take a look.
- Hurry up.

272
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,500
Mamma!

273
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:49,330
Come out, Mamma.

274
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,250
Oww!

275
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:49,500
Mamma, I want to play.

276
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:52,370
I'll see you, Mummy.

277
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:02,950
Amogh! Listen, Amogh.

278
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:05,830
Amogh.

279
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:07,830
Ishika.

280
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:11,950
Amogh, see Pihu's doll.

281
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,080
Ishika.

282
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,450
Amogh.

283
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:30,870
Amogh isn't speaking to me.

284
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,330
Mamma, come out.

285
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,250
Amogh.

286
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,660
Ishika.

287
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,660
Aarav is always after me.

288
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:49,830
Aarav.

289
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:53,660
He's not speaking to me.

290
00:53:57,250 --> 00:54:00,000
Ishika, see Pihu's doll.

291
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,580
Listen, Amogh.

292
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,950
Damn!

293
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,540
Shameless people!

294
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:22,120
No manners at all.

295
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:25,910
Damn, Damn.

296
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:30,870
They have money...

297
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:32,540
but when will
they learn some sense?

298
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:33,910
Oh-oh!

299
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,160
It hurts.

300
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:03,660
A cut.

301
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:05,540
I am hurt.

302
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,500
I'll fall.

303
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:19,080
Mummy.

304
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:35,620
Mamma.

305
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:38,910
Mamma.

306
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:43,830
Get up, please.

307
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:53,330
Ishika, bring Pihu's doll.

308
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,580
Listen, Amogh Bring Pihu's doll.

309
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:49,250
Amogh, Ishika.

310
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:51,330
Bring Pihu's doll.

311
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,080
Amogh.

312
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,290
No. No. No, baby.

313
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:06,040
Get down, baby.

314
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:08,120
Whose child is that?

315
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,330
Is anyone listening?

316
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:12,290
Look where she's standing?

317
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:14,200
Aunty, Pihu's doll.

318
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,040
What are you saying, baby?

319
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,620
Pihu's doll.

320
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:18,950
What?

321
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,250
Pihu's doll.

322
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,120
Aunty will bring the doll, baby.

323
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,410
Pihu's doll.

324
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,660
Where is your mamma, baby?

325
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,040
Mamma sleeping.

326
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:29,290
Call your Mamma. Go to your mamma.

327
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:30,500
Get down.

328
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:31,500
Hello! Is anybody there?

329
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:32,910
Is anyone watching her?

330
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,290
Pihu's doll.

331
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:36,700
Yes, baby. Aunty will get your doll.

332
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:39,370
Get down. Get down, baby.

333
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:42,750
Hey guard, why don't you
go up and check on that kid.

334
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:44,120
Someone check on her.

335
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:46,200
Baby, down. Get down.

336
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:47,870
Pihu's doll.

337
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,580
Down, baby. Very good.

338
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,370
Good girl.

339
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,200
Mamma plane.

340
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,040
Mamma papa's home.

341
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:07,160
Mamma come out.

342
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:32,660
Hey Puja, this is Meera.

343
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:35,370
I know you're not talking today.

344
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,660
But why do you keep
behaving like this?

345
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:39,500
What's gotten into you?

346
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:42,580
I am very happy with my married life.
You know that.

347
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,500
Hello, are you listening?

348
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:48,120
Listen, I am coming over to see you.

349
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,950
Mamma, what is aunty saying?

350
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,540
I am coming over
without your permission.

351
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:54,620
- What is aunty saying?
- Hello.

352
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,540
Hello.

353
00:58:57,830 --> 00:58:58,910
Pihu.

354
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:02,200
M... M...

355
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,540
Love you. See you soon.

356
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:07,750
I was calling.

357
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:11,700
Which aunty is this?

358
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:13,160
Aunty.

359
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,160
Aunty.

360
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:35,580
- Guard.
- Yes.

361
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:37,950
Why is the power supply fluctuating?

362
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,330
It will blow a fuse.

363
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,200
The generator's still
getting fixed, madam.

364
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:45,660
Power will be restored shortly.

365
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:40,450
Mamma, what is this?

366
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:42,290
Pihu is crying.

367
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,870
Mummy, look..
When I was a little baby.

368
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:51,040
See... little baby.

369
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:53,450
Little baby gets a kiss.

370
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,700
When I was a little baby.

371
01:00:57,790 --> 01:00:59,540
Mamma, Papa has come home.

372
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:01,870
Papa has come home.

373
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,330
Pintu, Pintu.

374
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:23,160
Send your brother down.
To help me carry this stuff.

375
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:35,830
Papa...

376
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,410
Its papa... Papa's picture.

377
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:44,250
Hello.

378
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:46,830
Puja... Puja I am...

379
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,040
Hello.

380
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,200
Hello.

381
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:51,370
Hello.

382
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,580
- Pihu.
- Hello.

383
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:55,790
Pihu. Pihu.

384
01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:57,810
Give the phone to your mamma, baby.

385
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,500
Papa has to go for a meeting.

386
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:01,080
Give her the phone now.

387
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:04,350
Stop playing with the phone, baby.
The line will get disconnected.

388
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:05,120
Please...

389
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,790
Mamma sleeping.

390
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,790
What are you saying, baby?

391
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:10,250
Mamma sleeping.

392
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:11,750
Mamma's sleeping.

393
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:15,250
Where is Papa?

394
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:16,080
Papa...

395
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,790
Papa's in Kolkata, baby.

396
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:20,790
- Mamma's in Kolkata.
- No baby, papa, not mamma.

397
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:23,540
Pihu. Will you do one thing for papa?

398
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:26,200
Hello. Pihu.

399
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:27,950
Come home, papa.

400
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,790
Yes, baby. Papa will come tomorrow.

401
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:34,250
Tell mamma... papa said...

402
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:35,750
Sorry.

403
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,360
What will you tell mamma, dear?

404
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,790
Will you tell mamma?

405
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:40,330
Sorry.

406
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:41,910
Okay, baby. Bye.

407
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,516
Papa's keeping the phone down now.

408
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:45,830
Papa will call back in one hour.
Okay, baby.

409
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:46,910
Papa loves you.

410
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:15,330
"Twinkle-Twinkle Little Star."

411
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:18,370
"Twinkle-Twinkle Little Star."

412
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:21,120
"Ring-a Ring-a Roses."

413
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:24,200
"Ring-a Ring-a Roses."

414
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:26,040
Meow, Tell me a story.

415
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:31,450
Meow-Meow.

416
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:16,790
Hello.

417
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:17,580
Good morning, madam.

418
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:19,370
Sorry. Good afternoon madam.

419
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:21,790
Am I talking to
Mrs. Puja Gupta Chaudhary?

420
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:26,120
Madam, I am speaking from
Bold and Beautiful Helpline.

421
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,120
We have a tie-up with
each and every beauty salon.

422
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,330
And we...

423
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:31,790
Mamma, say hello.

424
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:33,910
And we offer up-to-date services.

425
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:37,830
Like with an expensive hair-cut,
you'll get a bleach free.

426
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:40,290
And full body waxing plus...

427
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:42,410
Hello. Hello.

428
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:44,660
Can you hear me?

429
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:48,160
Why don't you hang up
if you're not interested?

430
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:49,790
Don't waste our time.

431
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:51,830
Look, Mamma.

432
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:54,790
Mamma... Get up.

433
01:05:58,620 --> 01:05:59,950
Mamma, food.

434
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,750
Get up, please.

435
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:04,910
Mamma, food.

436
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,790
Mummy.

437
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,750
Mummy.

438
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:21,450
Can I drink milk?

439
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,790
Can I drink milk?

440
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:25,660
Can I drink milk?

441
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,410
Mamma, Pihu's milk.

442
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,450
Oh no.

443
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:52,830
Get up, please.

444
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:57,830
Mamma, feed me.

445
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:04,750
Mummy.

446
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:05,910
Oh ho.

447
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,120
Mamma.

448
01:09:57,830 --> 01:10:00,080
It is all wet.

449
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:25,580
Mr. Gaurav.

450
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:27,450
Mr. Gaurav.

451
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:28,540
Yes...

452
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,660
Anybody home?

453
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:37,660
Hello. Hello.

454
01:10:37,950 --> 01:10:39,290
I guess no one's in.

455
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:45,450
Bunch of idiots.

456
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:48,290
They left the tap open.

457
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:54,540
This is so ridiculous...

458
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:56,160
We must complain about this.

459
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:57,250
Yes...

460
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:00,450
Even the power supply has
made our life hell today.

461
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:03,120
Yeah... it's getting difficult
to live here anymore.

462
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:04,830
Mr. Gaurav.

463
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:07,040
Mr. Gaurav.

464
01:11:13,790 --> 01:11:16,250
Let's go.
Get the generator fixed first.

465
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:17,790
Wait, I am coming.

466
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:21,580
Papa's calling...

467
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:22,370
Hello.

468
01:12:22,450 --> 01:12:24,160
Papa, tell me a story.

469
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:25,290
Pihu.

470
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:27,040
Pihu, give the phone to Mamma.

471
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:29,790
Pihu.

472
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:31,580
Hello.

473
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,450
Hello, Pihu.

474
01:12:34,330 --> 01:12:35,330
Pihu.

475
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:37,200
Papa, tell me a story first.

476
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:38,370
Yes, baby.

477
01:12:41,330 --> 01:12:43,950
And a tiger came at night.

478
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:48,370
The tiger started
coming closer slowly.

479
01:12:49,290 --> 01:12:51,040
He saw Noni.

480
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,330
And what did the tiger say?

481
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:54,660
Noni...

482
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:59,450
I will eat Noni's pony.

483
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,120
Pihu's coughing?

484
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,040
Go tell mamma to give you medicine.

485
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,540
- Papa, mamma's gone.
- What?

486
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:09,870
Mamma's gone?

487
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:11,660
Where did mamma go?

488
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,160
Pihu, call mamma.

489
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:15,950
Mamma's not here.

490
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,540
What are you saying, baby?

491
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:18,620
Where is Mamma?

492
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:20,870
Tell me where Mamma is.

493
01:13:20,950 --> 01:13:22,620
Mamma's gone to Kolkata.

494
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,080
What, baby?

495
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:25,700
Mamma's gone to Kolkata.

496
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:29,290
Papa's in Kolkata, baby.
Mamma is with you.

497
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:31,250
Mamma sleeping. Mamma sleeping.

498
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:34,000
Is Mamma is still sleeping, Pihu?

499
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:37,410
Go wake up Mamma.

500
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:38,830
Mamma sleeping. Mamma sleeping.

501
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:40,910
And say, Mamma good morning.

502
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:42,000
Pihu...

503
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,200
Mamma sleeping.

504
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:43,950
Go, baby.

505
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,750
Mamma sleeping. Mamma sleeping.

506
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:46,830
Pihu...

507
01:13:46,910 --> 01:13:47,660
Go.

508
01:13:47,870 --> 01:13:49,790
Go and wake her up.

509
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:50,750
S♪♪t

510
01:13:50,830 --> 01:13:51,620
Driver...

511
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:54,700
- Stop the car on the side?
- On the side?

512
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:56,370
Yes.

513
01:13:56,450 --> 01:13:57,790
But it's no parking.

514
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,120
I am telling you just stop here.

515
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,830
Mamma sleeping. Mamma sleeping.

516
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,540
Yes, baby. Papa heard you.

517
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:07,950
Go to mamma and don't hang up.

518
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:10,660
Pihu, did you hear?

519
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:12,410
Hello.

520
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:15,250
Where's my other phone?

521
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:18,250
Have you seen my other phone?

522
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:18,830
What?

523
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:19,950
S♪♪t

524
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,750
Pihu. Pihu, don't hang up.

525
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,750
Stay with papa.

526
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:38,790
Papa, mamma sleeping. Mamma sleeping.

527
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:41,580
I know, dear.

528
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:44,370
Just don't hang up.

529
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:46,160
Papa, come soon.

530
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:48,200
Yes, baby. Papa's coming.

531
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:50,910
Driver, take me to the airport.

532
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,000
- When are you coming?
- Papa's coming right now.

533
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:58,700
Stay on the line with papa.
Don't hang up.

534
01:14:58,910 --> 01:15:01,160
Will you play with papa?

535
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:01,950
Papa...

536
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,660
Hello. Pihu.

537
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:07,540
Please drive faster, Driver.
I am.

538
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:08,790
You can see...

539
01:15:08,870 --> 01:15:09,620
Oh kuhchi.

540
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:10,700
Oh kuchi.

541
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:12,950
Drive faster.

542
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,580
- Oh puchi.
- Oh puchi.

543
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:16,080
Oh, honey.

544
01:15:16,410 --> 01:15:17,160
Oh, honey.

545
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:19,910
- How long?
- What, sir?

546
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,950
How much longer to the airport?

547
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,080
One hour.

548
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:26,080
What? One hour.

549
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:27,830
Oh, Bunny.

550
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:28,790
Oh, Bunny.

551
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:31,330
- Please drive faster.
- Oh, Bunny.

552
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:33,790
Who is dad's baby?

553
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:35,790
Me!

554
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:39,040
Hey, this is Meera.

555
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,160
Sorry I can't take
your call right now.

556
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:43,160
Leave your message after the beep.

557
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:46,700
Hi, Meera.
You were supposed to meet Puja today.

558
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:47,830
Did you go see her?

559
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,370
Hope all is well there?

560
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:52,660
Hello?
Listen, can you do me a favor?

561
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:55,450
As soon as you get my
message please go to my home...

562
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:56,830
and call me immediately.

563
01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:58,080
Hello. Meera.

564
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,950
You please drive faster.
What are you waiting for?

565
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,370
I am driving faster. You can see...

566
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:07,160
- See what?
- The roads.

567
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:08,750
It's jammed.

568
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:10,660
Kolkata - what a stupid city!

569
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:14,870
Hello, Pihu. Papa's coming home.

570
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,330
Go to Mamma.

571
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,950
Mamma is sleeping.

572
01:16:19,330 --> 01:16:20,870
I'm not going to wake her up.

573
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:23,250
I will sit here.

574
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:30,620
Mamma, the phone is not working.

575
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,580
A fly is coming.

576
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,290
Eat?

577
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:54,870
Can I eat this?

578
01:17:58,790 --> 01:17:59,870
Can I eat this?

579
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:02,660
Can I eat this?

580
01:18:08,410 --> 01:18:10,790
The medicine is bitter.

581
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:19,620
Mamma, I want more.

582
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:26,950
Can I eat more?

583
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:35,790
Can I eat more, mamma?

584
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:51,660
I'm done.

585
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:58,000
I ate your bitter medicines.

586
01:18:58,870 --> 01:19:00,450
I'm done Mamma.

587
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,790
- Did anyone call the fire brigade?
- Yes.

588
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:37,580
I knew something was wrong.

589
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:40,750
Why is the water coming out?

590
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,250
If I hadn't warned everyone...

591
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:43,556
then the fire would've
spread throughout the building.

592
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:44,580
Where is Gaurav?

593
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:46,870
You're a strong guy.
Break the door down.

594
01:22:46,950 --> 01:22:49,700
He called the Police.
Why call the police?

595
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,200
He should've called the fire brigade.

596
01:22:52,290 --> 01:22:53,620
I went to the guard.

597
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:55,290
Does anyone have a hammer?

598
01:22:55,790 --> 01:22:57,370
Let's break the lock.

599
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,830
Let's everyone break
the door down together.

600
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:01,200
There's water coming out.

601
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:03,500
Show some courage, please.

602
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:05,750
I can't do this alone.

603
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:07,410
We have to call a few more guys.

604
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:10,040
You're a young man.
Yes... Come on.

605
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:11,580
Break it down.

606
01:23:11,660 --> 01:23:14,750
- Let's push together.
- Yes.

607
01:23:17,870 --> 01:23:19,200
You just make tall claims.

608
01:23:19,290 --> 01:23:22,000
- Does anyone know where Gaurav is?
- God knows.

609
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:24,000
He's on the way. He's coming.

610
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,540
When will he get here?

611
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:27,660
I called him. He said he's coming.

612
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:30,000
They were partying all night.

613
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:58,700
Gaurav's here.

614
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:03,790
Let Gaurav through.

615
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Puja...

616
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:22,660
Puja...

617
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:26,200
Puja...

618
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:29,910
Pihu...

619
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:36,540
Puja...

620
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,250
Pihu...

621
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:45,200
No.. no.. no..

622
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:50,660
Puja...

623
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,450
Puja, I am sorry.

624
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:56,250
Puja...

625
01:24:58,160 --> 01:24:59,160
Pihu...

626
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,200
Pihu...

627
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:03,660
Pihu...

628
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,160
Pihu...

629
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,200
Pihu...

630
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:10,750
Papa...

631
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:14,290
- Papa.
- Yes, baby.

632
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:16,080
Pihu.

633
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:17,080
Papa.

634
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:18,910
Pihu, where are you?

635
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:20,750
Papa is home, baby.

636
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:21,910
Papa.

637
01:25:22,830 --> 01:25:23,830
Pihu.

638
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:27,120
- See Papa, Pihu's home.
- Yes...

639
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:30,120
I built both the houses.

640
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:32,700
Papa, wake up mamma.

641
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:35,750
I'm making a beautiful home.
