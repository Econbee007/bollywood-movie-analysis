1
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,166
<i>Through leaves of apathy...</i>

2
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,250
<i>...I spy the fierce bark</i>
<i>of my generation.</i>

3
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:30,333
<i>A wretched blob of ups and downs.</i>

4
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:33,750
<i>Chasing phantoms in fancy suits.</i>

5
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,958
<i>The tree grows limp.</i>

6
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:43,291
<i>Cloudy skies cluster overhead.</i>

7
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,250
Seriously?

8
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,666
I know.

9
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,750
Hey! Where’s Niz?

10
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,208
Could you get him please?

11
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,291
Niz? Yeah, just one second.

12
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,125
Figs!

13
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,916
How’s it hanging brother?

14
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,291
Precariously.

15
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:23,791
Thanks!

16
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,250
Oh Jay, meet Figs.

17
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,375
Figs, Jay.

18
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:32,625
Hello Figs.

19
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,416
Interesting name.

20
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,666
Yeah. It’s short for Figaro.

21
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,250
Like the opera?

22
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:42,916
Yes...

23
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,375
Mozart.

24
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,708
My parents.
They’re lovers of the opera.

25
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,208
Ok then...

26
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:51,958
That’s new.

27
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:52,666
Thank you.

28
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,708
Awesome stuff!

29
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,125
It's your stuff!

30
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,208
Oh yes! Correct.

31
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,458
Niz! What the...

32
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,208
Where have you been?
I’ve been waiting, like forever!

33
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:18,583
I am a traveler, lost in a storm.

34
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:24,125
All I want to do is to love you.

35
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,916
You are my light, my inspiration.

36
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,958
You are my love,
my reason to live.

37
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,458
Maggie, I love you!

38
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,166
Wow! What awful poetry!

39
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:48,458
Figs...

40
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,416
A photographer and a poet!

41
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,166
Fantastic.

42
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,708
Good catch, Maggie.

43
00:04:55,041 --> 00:05:00,083
Figs. How's it going?

44
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,166
Yeah... well...

45
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,000
...pillaging, licentiousness and
drunken debauchery.

46
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,083
You know, the usual.

47
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,875
And you, sir?

48
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,208
Just chilling.

49
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,416
So... We’ll be back!

50
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,333
Oh and Figs...

51
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,958
Take it easy on the drinks 'yo'!

52
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:32,625
Ok 'yo'...

53
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:33,625
- See you.
- Bye.

54
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,208
Mishra! Tell me something…

55
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,000
Just roll another joint.

56
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,541
Yes, indeed!

57
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,333
- Maggie.
- Hey!

58
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,416
- Happy Birthday!
- Thank you.

59
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,708
You don’t smoke?

60
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,708
No. Is that a problem?

61
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:23,291
Yes, yes, yes...

62
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,375
No, no, no...

63
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,250
Why do guys always do that?

64
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,916
Do what?

65
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:02,125
You know? Have a smoke after...

66
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,083
How many guys have you known?

67
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,833
So, why are you sitting here?

68
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,291
Excuse me?

69
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,333
If you’ve got something to say...

70
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:21,458
...just say it.

71
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,625
Apologies. What’s your deal?

72
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,458
Excuse me?

73
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,541
You heard me.
What’s your deal?

74
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,416
Figs, you don’t know Jay?

75
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:38,375
Jayshri Bose! President, LSR Debsoc.

76
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,958
Debate! How cool! Wow...

77
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,875
Why don't you give us a rundown
of that debate speech?

78
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,125
So Figaro, what’s your deal?

79
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,416
Mine?

80
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,375
I am just in love with hash.

81
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,125
Yeah!

82
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,750
Why so serious, Mr.?

83
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,583
Nothing.

84
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,625
I was just thinking...

85
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,958
I might have to leave
 town for a few days.

86
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,291
I’m going to head to the hills.

87
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,207
Why? What happened?

88
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,625
Some work. Photography work.

89
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:44,000
Cool. So take me with you!

90
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,208
No! It’s work.

91
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,083
No! It’s work...

92
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,583
Come on! Don’t be silly.

93
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,000
Hey! What are you doing?

94
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,791
You’ll break it, baby! Stop it.

95
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,125
Of course not.
I know how to use this.

96
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,375
No. Stop. Don’t do that.

97
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,291
Come on. Smile.

98
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,041
I said stop!

99
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Come on... Niz!

100
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,625
Don’t make me use force!

101
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,666
Force is good.

102
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,541
So Jay, how’s everything in college?

103
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,500
Great.

104
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,500
In fact I’m working
 on a new assignment.

105
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,625
We’re doing a case
study on political refugees.

106
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,583
Niz and I, we have this
old school friend, Thupten.

107
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,708
He has become quite the
spokesman for a free Tibet.

108
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,166
Nice.

109
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,458
It’s a cause worth fighting for.

110
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,666
Listen to this bull shit!

111
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:01,375
Wow...

112
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,875
Guess everyone’s
entitled to an opinion...

113
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,833
Even the drunk village idiot!

114
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,791
Who do you think you are?
Che Guevara?

115
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,458
No, you’re not!

116
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,333
Not even close.

117
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:18,041
You’re just a silly, delusional,
bourgeois girl with a stick up her ass.

118
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,250
Who do you think you are?

119
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:25,541
You’re just a self-involved, vacuous...

120
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,041
...Freak.

121
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,750
What pretentious use of English!

122
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,958
Listen. What’s your name?

123
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,791
- Jay, right? Jay?
- Yeah.

124
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:35,916
Listen, Jay.

125
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:41,333
I know the world’s a fucked up place
but I’m also smart enough to know...

126
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,750
...that there’s nothing that you or I...

127
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,541
...sitting here in this
 beautiful posh farm house...

128
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,583
...can do about it.

129
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,250
So I’m just going to sit
 here and smoke this doobie...

130
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,500
...while the world can go fuck itself.

131
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,375
You’re an ass hole.

132
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,708
Yeah... I am!

133
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,208
Drop the yuppie act, will you? Get real.

134
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,666
Here she is folks!

135
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,791
Revolutionary Bose to the rescue.

136
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,791
Fighting evil and doing good.

137
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:07,916
How cute.

138
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,875
You’re right.

139
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,791
It is cute.

140
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,916
What? Jay? Jay?

141
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:24,625
Figs! Figs! Are you
ok, brother?

142
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,750
It’s all good. It’s all good.

143
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,125
Everyone’s a critic.

144
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,708
Figs? Figs?

145
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,875
Figs Bhardwaj... the things you do.

146
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,208

I bought them fresh from the Ritz,
Mr. Gupta. Just for the two of you!

171
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,625
The Ritz?

172
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,500
Yes.

173
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,666
We had our last kitty party there.

174
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,583
A resounding success.

175
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,208
I’m sure it was!

176
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,458
Why don’t you join us
 the next time, Vandana!

177
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,458
We’re having a bake sale
at the club.

178
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,500
Come early for cocktails.

179
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,500
I certainly will.

180
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:31,625
Will I not be invited?

181
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,000
Look. He wants to come as well.

182
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,750
Hey Figaro! Where have you been?

183
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,791
Come sit with us...

184
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,583
We’ve been waiting for
you for over an hour, dear.

185
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,333
Sorry guys! Apologies...

186
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,791
There was an emergency at
 Maggie’s place. It was kind of a...

187
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:44,875
What? What happened?

188
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,250
This girl, this friend of
Maggie’s I think she was...

189
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,958
...she was having this
 existential crisis and...

190
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,791
...I stayed up all night
consoling the poor creature.

191
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,708
Figaro! What rubbish!
Now come on...

192
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,375
Figaro, Figaro. Meet Mr Gupta...

193
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,583
Hello Figaro.
Pleasure meeting you.

194
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,000
And Mrs Gupta...

195
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:05,750
Hi.

196
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:10,000
Figaro, your dad tells me...

197
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:14,291
...that you’re interested
in corporate law?

198
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,875
Well actually...

199
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,541
No problem.
Come over tomorrow!

200
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,791
We’ll create a position of
a research assistant for you!

201
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,125
No problems at all.

202
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,625
No, no, no. Not tomorrow.

203
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,916
He has to finish his
application to Harvard first.

204
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,916
How about the day after?
Three in the afternoon?

205
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,291
Harvard? That’s great!

206
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,125
We’re actually also trying
for an MBA you know...

207
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,750
Then he can always
help Arun in his shipping.

208
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,125
But somehow I feel that...

209
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,541
...law is far more appealing.
Don’t you think?

210
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,666
Definitely. Definitely.

211
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,500
He will have a fantastic
experience with us.

212
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,833
Then he’ll go to Harvard...

213
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,083
...and then he’ll come back and
join us as a junior partner. Isn’t it?

214
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,541
- Figaro. Figaro.
- Figaro.

215
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,500
Wouldn’t that be wonderful?

216
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:03,958
Talking of shipping, Arun.
How’s the business going?

217
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,708
Well, not too terrible...

218
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,000
It’s this bloody! Oh I’m sorry.

219
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:13,500
It’s this recession, I’ve had
to cut back by like 12.77 percent...

220
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:17,416
I’ve had to get rid of some of my cargo
ships and cancelled so many contracts.

221
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,875
It’s all this ridiculous taxation.

222
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,208
I mean what are the...
what are the government folks doing?

223
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:25,541
Forcing us back into the socialist
hell-hole that we just climbed out of.

224
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,375
I mean... just bloody ridiculous.

225
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,583
How’s the tea?

226
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,083
Hmm Lovely.

227
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,708
Darjeeling Oolong.

228
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,458
First flush.

229
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:38,916
A cup a day and all your
sorrows dissipate, Mr Gupta.

230
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:58,708
Figs!

231
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,833
You son of a--

232
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,083
...no, not you!

233
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,458
Actually, you…

234
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:05,708
Where are you?

235
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,625
Yeah, well, I’m just
grabbing a bite...

236
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,708
...in Hauz Khas Village.

237
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,165
Listen! Let’s go get
some chocolate fudge.

238
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:12,958
Right now?

239
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,165
Yes! Now...

240
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,040
I’m picking you up, ok? Bye.

241
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,083
This is but the beginning!

242
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,833
The battle is yet to come…

243
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,665
This is but the beginning!

244
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,290
The battle is yet to come…

245
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,083
This is but the beginning!

246
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,458
Look, you love writing...

247
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,166
This is what you want to do!

248
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,500
Why do you need to go
along with it?

249
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,666
Maggie...

250
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,125
...you’re just not going to get it!

251
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,125
It’s my parents...

252
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,416
...they’re just from another planet.

253
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:53,958
Figs...

254
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,958
...I thought you were
better than this.

255
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,958
Psycho parents isn’t
exactly a novelty.

256
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,041
We’ve all been there.

257
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,708
Come up with something better!

258
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,208
Yeah, well, I guess I’m not
such a good writer after all.

259
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,541
Listen, Maggie,
tell me something…

260
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,041
What’s the scene with this guy?

261
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,833
Niz?

262
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,208
I mean...

263
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,791
...so far, so good, I guess.

264
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:22,875
It’s just that…

265
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,375
Don’t get me wrong.

266
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,875
I mean, I love him.

267
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,791
He’s great and
he’s so talented and...

268
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,791
It’s just sometimes...

269
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,083
...you know, he doesn’t
want to go out anywhere...

270
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,416
...doesn’t want to spend
on anything. It’s a bit…

271
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,000
Maybe that’s because he’s
not loaded like you Maggie.

272
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:41,750
Shut up.

273
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,000
Drop the yuppie act, will you?

274
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,333
Keep it real.

275
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,541
What?

276
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,458
Nothing, nothing.

277
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,333
Well, at least you’re leaving
me conscious this time around.

278
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,500
Sorry, I have to go.

279
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,500
We’ll chill some other time.

280
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:00,625
You need a ride?

281
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,666
No I think I’ll just
hang here for a bit.

282
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:04,375
Cool.

283
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,250
Go, go, go play footsie or
whatever it is you do.

284
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,541
Oh, and I forgot.

285
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,000
I’m out of hash.
Can you give me some?

286
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,208
Think I’m out as well, sorry.

287
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:26,000
Shit. Ok, so...

288
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,166
...ask Mishra.

289
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,125
Yeah I’ll do that.

290
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,625
If I can find him that is.

291
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,333
Ok, bye.

292
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:35,708
Maggie!

293
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:36,541
Yeah?

294
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,958
Nothing, nothing…
See you!

295
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:41,666
Bye.

296
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,791
Bye.

308
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,041
Mishra!

309
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:47,875
How are you?

310
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,375
Same old.

311
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,041
So...

312
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,583
Yeah so....

313
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,083
Last night was an experience, yeah?

314
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:06,458
Yeah well, guess
you could say that.

315
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,666
I mean you and Jay really hit it off?

316
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,375
What? Are you crazy?

317
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:18,083
No. Anyway I wanted to know
if I could score some hash?

318
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,708
Any chance I can get some... hash?

319
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,875
Hash. Hash...

320
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,250
Oh hash...

321
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,166
Do you have some?

322
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,583
Yes... certainly!

323
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,541
Hash. Hash...

324
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:51,708
Figs, looks like I’m out.

325
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,583
You’re joking, right?

326
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,708
No, no, no, I’m serious.

327
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,583
Ok tell me, in the meantime...

328
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,541
Could I interest you in some keta?

329
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,750
I just scored it from our
good friends over at the...

330
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:10,083
...Government of India
veterinary institute.

331
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,500
But what’s this?

332
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,000
Ketamine. Horse tranquilizer.

333
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:22,750
Yeah, well...

334
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:26,291
No cream, man?

335
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:27,208
No.

336
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:30,625
Just check if you have any cream.

337
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,166
M Cream.

338
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,583
M Cream. The best
hash in the world.

339
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,416
One puff and nirvana.

340
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,416
Sweet enough for Shiva himself.

341
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,708
It’s gone. It’s gone
my friend. It’s finished.

342
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,083
It’s returned to the
pantheon of the destroyer.

343
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,625
Alas. In that case
we mortals lie bereft.

344
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,083
This is a dire situation!

<i>And round and</i>

351
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:46,875
Arun, get up! We have to
go for lunch to the Khots’.

352
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,708
You know what they’re
 like... sticky. Come on.

353
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:52,875
Oh dear. I’m ready, I’m ready.

354
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:05,708
You know, Arun...

355
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:08,125
I’ve been thinking,
we should take Figs with us.

356
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:12,000
What the hell for? Let the young lad
do some work for a change.

357
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:14,416
You remember Irina?

358
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,208
Who?

359
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:17,583
Mr and Mrs Khots little girl.

360
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:18,250
Ah.

361
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:23,208
It just so happens she’s come back from
the US and she’s not so little anymore.

362
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:24,041
Oh.

363
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I think she would make
a great match for Figs.

364
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:30,250
A very suitable couple.

365
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:33,250
But I thought young Figs was besotted
with, what’s her name, Maggie.

366
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,375
Forget about Maggie.

367
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,125
What was that noise?

368
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,041
Figs!

369
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,208
What’s going on?

370
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:57,416
Hey guys.

371
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:00,166
Where do you think you’re going?

372
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,750
I’m just heading to the hills.
I’ll be gone for a few days.

373
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
What? Why?

374
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:07,166
Road trip.

375
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,916
Road trip? What are you
talking about? Are you serious!

376
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,791
Yeah, I should have
 told you this earlier but...

377
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:16,166
You know, this is all very
dramatic and awkward and stuff...

378
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,083
So I’m just going to take your leave.

379
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,000
See you guys!

380
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:19,958
Figs!

381
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:24,708
You’ve got to stop running if you really
want to find what you’re looking for.

382
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:33,000
Arun! Do something!

383
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,791
Vandana! Do What?

384
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:40,416
<i>"Yes I’ll be chasing..."</i>

385
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:45,166
<i>"...all you to the street."</i>

386
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:51,291
<i>"I’ll be chasing. I’ll be racing..."</i>

387
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:56,416
<i>"...you to the street."</i>

388
00:25:58,208 --> 00:25:59,875
<i>"To the street."</i>

389
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,625
See you later!

390
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,083
Hello.

391
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:06,833
Hey! Come on. Let’s go.

392
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:08,291
Whoa.

393
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:12,250
Oh Figs. You’ve met Jay, right?

394
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:13,833
She went to school with Niz.

395
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:17,166
Hi.

396
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:19,208
You guys know each other?

397
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:25,375
No... Thankfully.

398
00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:28,666
Oh.

399
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:29,833
Oh.

400
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,625
Maggie, I didn’t know she was coming.

401
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,833
- Figs, relax.
- You should have told me.

402
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:41,416
- So what’s the big deal?
- Maggie...

403
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:45,416
I hope you have enough booze
at least. I just got one bottle with me.

404
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:46,541
Yeah. It’s at the back.

405
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,250
- Niz, can you just check?
- Yeah, yeah...

406
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:51,916
At your service!

407
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:58,333
So... Two bottles of vodka.

408
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:04,333
Coke, vodka and more vodka.

409
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:05,625
Maggie?

410
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,291
What? I like vodka.

411
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:10,083
No scotch?

412
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,833
Nope.

413
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:12,625
That must be corrected.

414
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:13,291
Yeah.

415
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:17,125
Scotch? All right.

416
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:19,041
You drink whiskey?

417
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,125
Yes.

418
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:25,125
That’s nice. Cool, me too.

419
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,958
We’ll pick it up
on the way. Come on...

420
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:29,625
Let’s go.

421
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:30,541
Getting late...

422
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:33,750
Ready guys?

423
00:27:35,416 --> 00:27:36,708
- You’ll tell me later.
- Yeah I will.

424
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:44,416
<i>On the road again.</i>

425
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:51,083
<i>None are more hopelessly enslaved than</i>
<i> those who falsely believe they are free.</i>

426
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:56,333
<i>And there we were,</i>
<i>children of chaos and anarchy.</i>

427
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:58,875
<i>Escaping into the endless unknown.</i>

428
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:01,958
<i>We are free.</i>

429
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:05,041
<i>On the road again.</i>

430
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:10,875
Butter chicken and bread?

431
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:11,958
Sir, it’s over.

432
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:15,291
Ok.

433
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:17,500
Mughlai chicken and bread?

434
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:18,625
Sir, it’s over.

435
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:20,500
Is anything available?

436
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:23,458
- Sir, you tell me!
- No you tell me!

437
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:24,958
Chicken fry...

438
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:26,416
- And bread?
- Yes, sir.

439
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,083
Done.

440
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:28,750
With vegetables on the side.

441
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:30,375
- Ok.
- Thank you.

442
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:33,625
So where are we spending the night?

443
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,416
Oh... At this abandoned guest
house just off the highway.

444
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:40,791
My uncle owns it, he’s a minister.

445
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:43,208
Abandoned?

446
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:48,833
Yeah. I think it used to be Indira Gandhi’s
 guest house or something like that.

447
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,666
But no one lives there anymore.

448
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:53,791
Haunted house.

449
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:57,125
Shut up, Niz.
Don’t kid around.

450
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:02,250
I’m scared of ghosts.

451
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:04,375
Yeah, ghosts are so scary.

452
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,958
Anyway screw that.

453
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:09,791
Mababajagal here we come!

454
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,250
I can smell the cream
and it smells good.

455
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:14,916
What is he talking about?

456
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:16,541
We’re going to Dharamsala.

457
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,000
What the hell is Mababajagal?

458
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:20,875
Dharamsala?

459
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,833
Jay, right...

460
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:31,833
Mababajagal is this
mythical magical place.

461
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,291
The source of M Cream,
this mythical magical hash.

462
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:38,083
And... we’re all going
to go look for it.

463
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:40,916
And Figs...

464
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:43,833
We are going to Dharamsala first.

465
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:47,375
Jay and I’ve got an
old friend there, Thupten.

466
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:50,291
Plus she’s doing a
write-up on Tibetans...

467
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:51,375
...in exile...

468
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:54,166
...and I’m taking photographs.

469
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,083
Remember I told you?

470
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:58,708
The assignment...

471
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,750
What?

472
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:03,250
What are you looking at me for?

473
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:07,916
Will you grow up?

474
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:09,833
Yeah...

475
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:10,875
Maybe I will.

476
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,916
When you stop being a
self-righteous, little bimbo!

477
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:16,208
Listen, relax.

478
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:17,875
It’s not her fault.

479
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:23,291
I think I’ve diagnosed
 your problem, Figaro.

480
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:24,166
Really, what is it?

481
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:27,833
You’re just a spoilt, selfish brat...

482
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,916
...who thinks of nothing
other than his own petty existence.

483
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:33,583
And you’re just a
hypocritical little bimbo.

484
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,041
Hypocritical?

485
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,208
Oh yeah?

486
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:37,791
People like you...

487
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:41,166
...spout shit about this cause
and that cause...

488
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,625
And you sit here
doing nothing about it.

489
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,500
It’s almost funny
if it weren’t so pathetic.

490
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:48,333
I do what I do...

491
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:50,333
...because it affects me.

492
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:51,208
Ok?

493
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:54,416
It affects me when there’s a
 random terrorist attack in my city.

494
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:58,666
It affects me when the government
goes on and on about our rising GDP...

495
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,041
...when a majority of our
people are still poor.

496
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:04,166
And it affects me that no
one gives a damn about Tibet.

497
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,416
Because there’s no
oil there, there’s only people.

498
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:08,500
It affects me so fuck you!

499
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,833
It affects you?

500
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:11,625
Miss, I hate to say it...

501
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:13,958
...but you’re a walking cliché.

502
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:16,541
Come on... Unbelievable.

503
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,750
Figs.

504
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:24,208
What’s your problem?

505
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:31,958
Drama.

506
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:33,375
I love it.

507
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:38,541
<i>"And for all</i>
<i>those locks and keys..."</i>

508
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:42,500
<i>"...yeah, we leave</i>
<i>them all behind..."</i>

509
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:49,041
<i>"For the leaves</i>
<i>and for the trees..."</i>

510
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:52,750
<i>"For the countless lullabies."</i>

511
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,291
Spooky.

512
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:56,833
Shut up.

513
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:03,791
Sleeping arrangements. Shotgun, Niz
and I will take the big bedroom.

514
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:05,625
Jay, you can have the other one.

515
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:09,416
And Figs, the couch
is all yours.

516
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,416
Yay!

517
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:13,208
Niz, make the drinks quickly!

518
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:14,250
That’s what I’m doing.

519
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:18,583
Yuck! This place is so dirty.

520
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:21,208
This place is beautiful.

521
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:25,666
I am so exhausted.

522
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,125
Here you go!

523
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:30,208
Thank you.

524
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:34,416
And here you go...

525
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,625
A toast to us... a toast to us...

526
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:49,958
...and to the dangerous promise
of the unknown road ahead.

527
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,791
I’ll drink to that!

528
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:54,958
Cheers.

529
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:04,541
So...

530
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,166
Do you guys do these
road trip things often?

531
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:09,458
You think?

532
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:14,125
Getting Niz to go someplace is like getting
Anna Hazare to clean up corruption.

533
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,291
Easier said than done.

534
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:19,791
Well unlike some people
I have to earn a living.

535
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,583
What are you going to do?
Working class blues...

536
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,625
What’s with that attitude?

537
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:28,250
Nothing...

538
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,875
It’s just that
you seem to forget that...

539
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:35,708
...we did go to Jim Corbett
over winter break.

540
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,083
For, like, two days!

541
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:41,333
And please that’s because Rishi was
going through this animal planet phase.

542
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:42,666
It doesn’t count.

543
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:43,916
Who’s Rishi?

544
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:47,875
Rishi Rastogi. We used
to hangout a lot, earlier...

545
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:54,375
He came out. Yeah...
became quite an issue.

546
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:58,500
His dad was furious, threw
 him out and all that stuff.

547
00:33:58,583 --> 00:33:59,250
That’s sad...

548
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:03,541
...we modern Indians aren’t as
open minded as we pretend to be.

549
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:04,625
Anyway...

550
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:08,958
He moved in with this guy
 somewhere in North Campus and...

551
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,166
...I guess we drifted apart.

552
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:15,166
Seconds please.

553
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:18,708
That was quick!

554
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:23,291
So should we play some music?

555
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:24,833
I’m on it.

556
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,291
Much obliged.

557
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:29,833
Miss Bose.

558
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:33,583
Come on, sexy.
Show me some moves!

559
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:34,833
Ok.

560
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:36,541
Come on.

561
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:52,458
What are you doing?

562
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:54,583
Nothing.

563
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:56,791
Do you write?

564
00:34:59,250 --> 00:34:59,833
No.

565
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:02,416
Well, it looks like you’re writing.

566
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:08,708
Ok, well, yeah...
A little bit.

567
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:13,541
You know, Jay?

568
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:14,333
Hmm...

569
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:16,041
I was meaning to
 talk to you about this...

570
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:19,875
...well, look, I am sorry, all right.

571
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:24,250
I know I was a little hard on you earlier.

572
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:28,750
Is that a smile?

573
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:31,250
No.

574
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,416
Looks like one.

575
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:34,416
Looks can be deceiving.

576
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:35,500
Uh huh.

577
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:40,000
Actually, Figs...

578
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:47,583
I’ve given it some thought and
 we’re not so different, you and I.

579
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:50,500
You’re drunk already?

580
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:55,208
No! Well maybe a little...

581
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,875
Thank god.

582
00:35:58,125 --> 00:35:59,916
Can you imagine being
sober around those two?

583
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:02,166
No, I can’t...

584
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:09,625
I digress, the point is that we both
view the world in very similar ways.

585
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:10,458
Uh huh.

586
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,041
Scary as that sounds.

587
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:16,458
I mean, think about it... It’s a mess!

588
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:22,500
On the one hand we’re the fastest
growing economy, the biggest democracy,

589
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:24,625
Poster boy for
all things awesome...

590
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:26,583
And on the other hand?

591
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,000
Where was I?

592
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,500
The other hand...

593
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:37,166
Right...

594
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:40,000
Fucking chaos.

595
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:46,666
And you get that. Like me.

596
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:49,333
Oh yeah, I do?

597
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:50,625
Yeah...

598
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:57,291
Yeah, a lot of people don’t.
Or at least they don’t seem to.

599
00:36:58,791 --> 00:36:59,708
Do you know what I mean?

600
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,000
Not really.

601
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:02,208
Good night, guys.

602
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:03,583
Good night.

603
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,916
Till the morning comes.

604
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:08,125
Go get a room, already...

605
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,000
What do you think we are doing?

606
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:18,708
I don’t know what he sees in her.

607
00:37:19,791 --> 00:37:22,250
He’s like the perfect guy.

608
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:24,541
Perfect guy?

609
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,166
So...

610
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:32,958
I was saying something important.

611
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:34,916
Were you?

612
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,000
Yeah, about how we’re not so...

613
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:37,916
Exactly.

614
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:43,833
Hey, can you pass
me the bottle please?

615
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:45,125
Might as well.

616
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:59,250
Wow. I’m proud of you, you
 didn’t seem like the drinking type.

617
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:04,250
Why not? Stereotypes are dangerous.

618
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:13,625
Yeah, well... you just seem extremely
wholesome! Nice, simple, girl next door.

619
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:20,625
Huh... What?

620
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:22,208
What does that mean?

621
00:38:25,916 --> 00:38:27,875
Yeah, you know...

622
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:29,958
...you Bengali women...

623
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:35,833
...are just a bunch of
cliquish, pseudo intellectuals.

624
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:39,083
Are you kidding me?

625
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:39,958
No.

626
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:45,916
You Punjabi boys are just a
 bunch of cheap, flashy brats!

627
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,458
At least you’re easy on the eyes...

628
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:53,000
Is that a compliment?

629
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:55,708
No.

630
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:00,875
So, I was saying...

631
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:03,041
As you were saying...

632
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,250
Yeah.

633
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:10,750
Never mind.

634
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:17,791
Where are you going?

635
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:21,750
Got to get more booze silly.

636
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:26,625
Look at this woman...

637
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,666
You got to go to sleep silly!

638
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,416
No.

639
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,500
Let’s go! Get up.

640
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:32,708
Come on, Get up man!

641
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:36,041
You, evil boy. What are
 you doing? Put me down.

642
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,625
- You are getting to bed.
- I’m fine, Figaro.

643
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:40,166
No, you are not. Sleep!

644
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,000
- I don’t want to sleep.
- Yes.

645
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:44,375
You are getting to bed, right now.

646
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:46,916
No, please...

647
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:51,291
- Booze, Can I have more booze?
- No.

648
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:55,958
Goodnight.

649
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:58,125
Goodnight.

650
00:40:02,041 --> 00:40:03,000
See you.

651
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,375
- Hold on.
- It's stuck.

652
00:40:13,583 --> 00:40:14,375
Come on.

653
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:16,208
Move, ok, move, let me do it.

654
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:19,958
Hey!

655
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:21,041
You’re late.

656
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:21,875
You’re grumpy.

657
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,916
Whatever.

658
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:24,625
Can I just dump this?

659
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,541
Good morning.

660
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:26,708
Hey...

661
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,333
Welcome, finally.

662
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:30,875
Let's go.

663
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:33,166
All aboard?

664
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,958
- Yes, let’s go.
- So hung over.

665
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,750
Shut up.

666
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:26,666
<i>"Speak no evil."</i>

667
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:32,625
<i>"Don’t speak evil."</i>

668
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:40,500
<i>"Speak no evil."</i>

669
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:58,750
<i>"Don’t speak evil."</i>

670
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:16,625
<i>"Speak no evil."</i>

671
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:12,750
<i>This whole whacked out</i>
<i> world is just too frustrating.</i>

672
00:43:13,541 --> 00:43:15,791
<i>A flashy postcard</i>
<i>with the inscription...</i>

673
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:17,916
<i>"This is my simple religion..."</i>

674
00:43:18,666 --> 00:43:22,291
<i>"There’s no need for temples,</i>
<i>no need for complicated philosophy..."</i>

675
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:24,583
<i>"...the philosophy is kindness."</i>

676
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:27,791
<i>So, it’s really that simple, is it?</i>

677
00:43:29,916 --> 00:43:33,416
<i>Delhi, 1984. Bombay, 1992.</i>

678
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:37,000
<i>Gujarat, 2002. Assam, 2012.</i>

679
00:43:38,166 --> 00:43:41,791
<i>In the name of religion, countless</i>
<i> men, women and children butchered alive!</i>

680
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:47,958
<i>All in the name of religion?</i>
<i> Or in the game of politics?</i>

681
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:53,875
<i>This whole whacked out</i>
<i>world is just too frustrating.</i>

682
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:00,583
Thupten!

683
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:03,416
Jay! How are you?

684
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:04,208
Absolutely fine.

685
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:05,750
I wasn’t sure when
you guys were coming.

686
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:07,083
- I know, we got here much earlier.
- Thupten!

687
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:09,125
- Hey, Niz...
- How are you?

688
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:10,208
I’m good. How are you?

689
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:11,000
Very well.

690
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,291
Ah! This is Maggie.

691
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:16,291
- Hi.
 - Hello.

692
00:44:17,916 --> 00:44:20,750
And... Yeah, that is Figs.

693
00:44:20,916 --> 00:44:23,125
- Hey, how are you?
- Very good.

694
00:44:23,958 --> 00:44:25,625
So, who’s hungry?

695
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:26,583
- Me.
- Me.

696
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:28,000
Great!

697
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:34,875
So, Figs and Maggie,
how do you like 'Little Lhasa'?

698
00:44:35,375 --> 00:44:37,375
I love it. It’s gorgeous.

699
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:43,000
It’s a strange place.

700
00:44:43,916 --> 00:44:44,875
How so?

701
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:48,375
I mean, yeah it’s gorgeous of course...

702
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:52,625
...but there’s this strange
brew of politics and religion.

703
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:56,000
Things that I find
completely unnecessary.

704
00:44:57,041 --> 00:45:01,416
It’s a beautiful place,
 caught up in a pointless exercise.

705
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:05,375
I mean, Tibet’s
never going to be free ...

706
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:10,750
And praying isn’t going to solve
 anything. It’s all pretty pointless really.

707
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:17,333
The cause is hopeless,
perhaps. But not the fight...

708
00:45:18,291 --> 00:45:21,625
I believe in fighting. My faith
has certainly helped me in that.

709
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:24,875
Well, I’m not so convinced...

710
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:28,916
Frankly religion hasn’t done
 much other than divide and destroy...

711
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:33,625
It’s an emotional crutch.

712
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:36,708
Figs has a point there.

713
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:43,916
Ah! I do? I mean,
yeah I do... Of course.

714
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:51,666
Movements need to be organic, they
need to matter. They need to be real.

715
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:56,250
That’s when things can change
but very often that reality...

716
00:45:56,416 --> 00:45:59,833
...gets sidelined by many
forces, including religion...

717
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:04,583
...I don’t know if I’m
making any sense.

718
00:46:07,583 --> 00:46:11,541
People believing in something is different
than people being told to believe in something.

719
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,750
The source is love after all.

720
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:18,083
I agree that you need to
question religion if it invalidates love.

721
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:23,125
I think... I don’t know.

722
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:29,000
Just live and let live.
I mean, that’s my point!

723
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:32,541
That’s a flawed point, Niz!

724
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:36,875
Our generation achieves
nothing because we’re passive by nature...

725
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:40,583
And the funny part is, we have
 a voice, we just don’t know it.

726
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:42,041
- There is nothing passive about--
- Ok!

727
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:44,750
Let’s just change the topic.

728
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:55,958
Aren’t you sick of her
 soapbox lectures? I know I am.

729
00:46:58,208 --> 00:47:00,916
In Buddhism, we have a saying.

730
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:05,208
'A straw floats
on the surface of water...'

731
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:07,916
'...but a precious gem
placed upon it sinks’.

732
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:13,583
You know what? I don’t get it.

733
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:21,000
Ok I’ll see you guys
tomorrow. Good night!

734
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Hey, hey!

735
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:31,583
- Oh. Hey!
- What’s going on?

736
00:47:32,375 --> 00:47:36,583
Phew. It was getting really
 intense in there. Had to get out.

737
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:42,583
So, you like freezing?

738
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:47,083
I like breathing in fresh
air while it’s still around.

739
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:56,291
You know, you were
 really drunk the other night?

740
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,208
You do remember
some of that, don’t you?

741
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,375
Was I? Which night?

742
00:48:01,958 --> 00:48:03,083
Precisely.

743
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:09,875
You’re very fond of Maggie.

744
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:13,041
Why do you say that?

745
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,208
It’s pretty obvious Figs.

746
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:16,958
Yeah.

747
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:22,500
Yeah well, I am... I was.

748
00:48:25,291 --> 00:48:27,500
But I’m not so sure
anymore, though.

749
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:32,750
We should go.

750
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,625
No we shouldn’t.
We should stay right here.

751
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,166
Prisoners of the night.

752
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:01,166
Good morning, sir.

753
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:02,958
Hey, slept well?

754
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,208
Like a rock.

755
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:07,208
Tea?

756
00:50:07,958 --> 00:50:09,458
Mmm... Perfect.

757
00:50:14,583 --> 00:50:15,875
Here...

758
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,083
Thanks.

759
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:20,291
And, here you go!

760
00:50:21,791 --> 00:50:23,583
- Toast, butter and jam.
- Yummy!

761
00:50:26,916 --> 00:50:29,666
Niz told me you guys
are going to Mababajagal?

762
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:31,833
Have you heard of it?

763
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:34,333
Some say it’s the oldest
democracy on earth.

764
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:36,125
Really?

765
00:50:36,583 --> 00:50:40,583
And they have the best hash too.

766
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,500
What are you reading?

767
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:49,000
An article by Marie Sartre,
this French journalist.

768
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:52,958
Oh my god! I love her.
She’s fantastic.

769
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,208
She really writes it
like it is, you know!

770
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:58,541
Yeah. Do you know that she’s been
 in this area for quite some time now?

771
00:50:59,208 --> 00:51:01,666
Here? I had no idea.

772
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:05,000
She has been writing extensively
on this Paradise Found project.

773
00:51:05,458 --> 00:51:06,416
What’s that?

774
00:51:06,916 --> 00:51:09,791
This international chain is
trying to build a luxury resort.

775
00:51:10,166 --> 00:51:12,166
They are soon going
to cut down the forest.

776
00:51:12,791 --> 00:51:13,791
What?

777
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:19,666
The villagers are protesting,
the protest is gaining momentum.

778
00:51:19,916 --> 00:51:20,583
Is it?

779
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:24,166
Of course the media and activists
from all over have been pouring in.

780
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:29,916
And... I’m sure they could
 use all the help they can get.

781
00:51:30,125 --> 00:51:32,125
Since you are going
to be in the area...

782
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:34,791
...it might be worth stopping by.

783
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,166
Thupten, I’d love to!

784
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:42,291
But it’ll depend on the others...

785
00:51:45,458 --> 00:51:47,458
I’ll definitely try.

786
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,333
<i>"Looking back on life."</i>

787
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:00,041
<i>"I sometimes wonder why..."</i>

788
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,125
<i>"...it takes so long to find..."</i>

789
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,041
<i>"...a way to make it right."</i>

790
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:15,250
<i>"Free, free riding."</i>

791
00:52:17,041 --> 00:52:18,916
<i>"It’s my life."</i>

792
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:27,333
<i>"Free, free riding."</i>

793
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:32,083
<i>"Free..."</i>

794
00:52:42,041 --> 00:52:42,708
Hello.

795
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:46,458
Is this Mababajagal?

796
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:48,625
Honey, It ain’t.

797
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:52,125
Mababajagal’s on the
other side of the mountain.

798
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,791
Thirty miles as the crow flies.

799
00:52:56,875 --> 00:52:58,291
Join us.

800
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:00,708
Thank you.

801
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:07,458
Where are you folks coming from?

802
00:53:07,541 --> 00:53:08,291
Dharamsala.

803
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:16,916
Well I reckon you took a wrong turn
 someplace. It’s funny how that happens!

804
00:53:17,958 --> 00:53:22,250
I’m Vishnu Das by the way.
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

805
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:25,625
And this, here, is my little lady.

806
00:53:26,916 --> 00:53:27,916
Hello.

807
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,958
You can call me Sunshine Daydream.

808
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,916
Jayashri Bose.

809
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:34,375
Niyaz.

810
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:36,791
Hi.

811
00:53:37,125 --> 00:53:39,125
What’s your name, sweetheart?

812
00:53:39,291 --> 00:53:40,166
Meghna.

813
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:43,958
Figs, I’m Figs.

814
00:53:45,041 --> 00:53:47,166
All right. So we’re all friends now.

815
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:51,500
So Vishnu sahib,
where are we exactly?

816
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:55,875
Oh. The Elysian fields...

817
00:53:56,125 --> 00:54:00,666
...the garden of Eden,
the abode of Aphrodite.

818
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:05,333
We just call it the commune.

819
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:10,750
<i>It’s just up around the corner.</i>

820
00:54:11,625 --> 00:54:14,833
<i>I don’t know what it is</i>
<i>but it keeps getting stronger.</i>

821
00:54:16,541 --> 00:54:21,291
<i>Painted faces beneath the diamond sky,</i>
<i>dancing bodies on the emerald earth.</i>

822
00:54:22,166 --> 00:54:24,166
<i>Flowers in her hair and</i>
<i>madness in her eyes.</i>

823
00:54:25,958 --> 00:54:27,958
<i>It’s just up around the corner.</i>

824
00:54:30,708 --> 00:54:35,541
<i>I feel like an outlaw,</i>
<i>a fugitive on the run.</i>

825
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,875
<i>I guess there is no turning back.</i>

826
00:54:39,458 --> 00:54:41,583
Don’t knock it if
you haven’t tried it!

827
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:47,291
Like books are food for the mind,
 LSD is food for the soul.

828
00:54:49,541 --> 00:54:51,416
Call me a dirty old
hippie, if you like...

829
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:55,750
...but if we all smoked pot and
tripped on acid every now and then,

830
00:54:56,291 --> 00:54:58,541
the world would be a lot groovier...

831
00:54:59,083 --> 00:55:00,750
...I do believe it!

832
00:55:02,958 --> 00:55:05,125
You and Figs would get along great!

833
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:06,166
Yeah?

834
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:13,125
Hey!

835
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:14,416
Hi!

836
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,166
Let’s go. Where’s Niz?

837
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:23,708
- I left some stuff in the car.
- Oh!

838
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:30,041
Niz is such an idiot.
I mean, we’re completely lost...

839
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:32,333
What a mess.

840
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:34,916
Chill. We’ll find the way.
It’s ok.

841
00:55:41,291 --> 00:55:44,000
Is everything ok?

842
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,166
Yeah. Thanks for your concern!

843
00:55:50,041 --> 00:55:50,625
What do you mean?

844
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:57,041
Figs, just because you’ve found a
girlfriend, will you forget your friends?

845
00:56:00,375 --> 00:56:02,041
What do you mean, Maggie?

846
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:04,208
Huh?

847
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:05,416
Nothing. Forget it.

848
00:56:06,416 --> 00:56:12,166
I first came to this country in 1968,
part of the infamous hippie exodus.

849
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:16,208
It’s sort of been home ever since...

850
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,291
Got myself a little
shack around the corner.

851
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,750
I give tours, lectures...

852
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:29,458
...write
books on meditation. Yeah.

853
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:34,166
For a kid from Baton Rouge, Louisiana,
I’d say that’s doing all right!

854
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:39,916
Say, I’d love to have
you kids over sometime!

855
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:45,375
You don’t need to buy anything!
Well it wouldn’t hurt if you did...

856
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:46,583
If we did what?

857
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:50,208
Vishnu Das has invited us
to his charming establishment.

858
00:56:51,166 --> 00:56:51,750
Oh, what’s that?

859
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:55,583
He runs a shack and he might
have some things that will interest us.

860
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:56,541
What do you guys say?

861
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:58,041
- Sounds good.
- Yeah sure.

862
00:56:58,291 --> 00:56:59,583
All right, let’s go!

863
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,625
Hey Mr. Vishnu!

864
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:16,333
Do you happen to have any decent
accessories to go along with this one?

865
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:18,666
That one’s a real beauty, ain’t she?

866
00:57:19,666 --> 00:57:24,625
I’ve got some hash if that’s what
you mean, kid. But it ain’t no cream!

867
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,750
You know the government
folks are building some...

868
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:31,625
...glitzy resort between
here and Mababajagal.

869
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:34,083
And there’s been trouble
with the locals!

870
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,750
We can’t get any decent hash.

871
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,916
Is the trouble bad?

872
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:45,375
Well there ain’t no such
 thing as good trouble!

873
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:50,833
You know, my advice is if you all
are planning on heading there anyway...

874
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:53,375
...you all might as well wait.

875
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,625
Oh no! I can’t wait,
I’m sick of waiting, please.

876
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:02,083
Well, patience is a virtue, sweetheart.

877
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,375
And you strike me
as the virtuous kind.

878
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:12,958
Well, I’ll take this one.
For posterity then.

879
00:58:13,333 --> 00:58:14,791
You won’t regret it!

880
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:18,416
Sir. We’re running low on booze and...

881
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:22,333
...I get that you don’t have any cream but is
there some other way you could sort us out?

882
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:29,083
Well, let’s see if I
can help you all out.

883
00:58:30,166 --> 00:58:35,583
Could I interest you in some acid?

884
00:58:39,958 --> 00:58:45,041
Nothing floats your
boat quite like LSD.

885
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:48,250
Mr. Vishnu, trust me I know...

886
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:51,416
Ok, we’ll take three stamps.

887
00:58:51,791 --> 00:58:52,708
Three?

888
00:58:53,083 --> 00:58:54,333
Make that four.

889
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:57,208
Are you sure about this?

890
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:02,291
Don’t knock it if you
haven’t tried it, right?

891
00:59:02,541 --> 00:59:04,000
Right.

892
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:06,541
Great.

893
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:30,791
Slowly, slowly stay my mind.

894
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:36,250
Slowly everything happens.

895
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:40,541
The gardener may
water a hundred times...

896
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:44,791
...but when the season comes,
there is fruit.

897
00:59:45,875 --> 00:59:48,916
This banana is fantastic.

898
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:54,500
Did you just say that?

899
00:59:55,541 --> 00:59:57,416
It’s magical.

900
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:16,458
I don’t think I’ve seen an
orange as orange as that.

901
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:19,416
This orange, actually, ever before.

902
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:23,333
You’re messing up my
picnic. Are you nuts?

903
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:26,125
Look!

904
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,333
This orange...

905
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:08,458
Yes, madam?

906
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,500
It must die.

907
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:26,375
It must die...

908
01:01:47,416 --> 01:01:49,291
Listen!

909
01:04:35,375 --> 01:04:37,875
<i>Sun king plays on my face.</i>

910
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,791
<i>Crystal parliaments shatter easy.</i>

911
01:04:42,458 --> 01:04:44,458
<i>Sun king plays on my face.</i>

912
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,041
<i>Love is atomic sugar.</i>

913
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,958
<i>Sun king plays on my face.</i>

914
01:04:52,333 --> 01:04:53,833
<i>Two strands merge.</i>

915
01:05:40,333 --> 01:05:44,208
Guys, we should probably
hit the road soon...

916
01:05:44,791 --> 01:05:46,791
Food is good.

917
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:48,750
Food is good.

918
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:50,583
I love food.

919
01:05:51,375 --> 01:05:52,625
I love food too.

920
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:55,458
I just lost my appetite.

921
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,708
- Good morning, kids.
- Good morning.

922
01:06:06,166 --> 01:06:06,750
Coffee?

923
01:06:07,708 --> 01:06:09,375
I don’t mind if I do.

924
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:21,125
How was the acid trip?

925
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,333
Full power.

926
01:06:27,208 --> 01:06:27,833
Jay?

927
01:06:31,208 --> 01:06:33,125
Glad to be of service.

928
01:06:36,875 --> 01:06:38,291
- Is everything ok?
- Yeah.

929
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:58,250
Darling... Darling, make love.

930
01:06:58,375 --> 01:06:59,208
No darling!

931
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:00,250
Make love not...

932
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:11,083
I was going to say
make love not war.

933
01:07:12,666 --> 01:07:15,416
She’s been mad as a wet
hen these last few days.

934
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:20,958
It’s our annual Moon
Rave tonight. Lots to do...

935
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:23,291
Moon rave? What’s that?

936
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:26,583
Well, a bunch of kids get
 together every other night.

937
01:07:28,416 --> 01:07:34,500
They do drugs and have sex and then
 they do more drugs and have more sex.

938
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:36,125
That’s pretty much it.

939
01:07:36,416 --> 01:07:37,250
Ok.

940
01:07:37,708 --> 01:07:40,500
Sounds like fun. We should go right?

941
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:43,583
I don’t know,
we should get going.

942
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:46,833
Come on! We can
hit the road tomorrow.

943
01:07:48,166 --> 01:07:49,875
Do we always have to
do what you want?

944
01:07:52,208 --> 01:07:56,416
Niz! We’ve come this far,
we might as well go all the way.

945
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,291
Let’s just do what Jay wants.

946
01:08:09,583 --> 01:08:12,875
This place was such a happy accident.

947
01:08:13,125 --> 01:08:13,791
Yeah.

948
01:08:15,708 --> 01:08:21,957
Maggie’s party seems like so
long ago. Doesn’t it, Figaro?

949
01:08:22,125 --> 01:08:26,750
It seems like years ago. And you
were so friendly to me that night.

950
01:08:26,832 --> 01:08:27,582
Hey!

951
01:08:30,207 --> 01:08:32,082
But is it not love that
knows how to make...

952
01:08:32,207 --> 01:08:35,166
...smooth things rough and
 rough things smooth?

953
01:08:36,916 --> 01:08:38,166
That’s deep.

954
01:08:38,832 --> 01:08:42,125
It is. It’s not me,
it’s Vikram Seth.

955
01:08:44,332 --> 01:08:44,916
Ah.

956
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:49,541
I was just thinking
that things change.

957
01:08:49,916 --> 01:08:53,541
Yeah. But... I mean, come on,
wouldn’t life be boring if they didn’t?

958
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:55,582
I guess.

959
01:08:57,582 --> 01:09:00,207
Sometimes things get more
complicated than they should be.

960
01:09:00,291 --> 01:09:02,582
I mean, look at the four of us...

961
01:09:04,916 --> 01:09:08,832
Yeah. Changes upon changes,
we are more or less the same.

962
01:09:09,707 --> 01:09:10,666
Vikram Seth?

963
01:09:11,207 --> 01:09:13,541
Close. Simon and Garfunkel.

964
01:09:15,082 --> 01:09:15,832
Idiot.

965
01:09:16,416 --> 01:09:20,332
Let’s head back!
We have a long night ahead.

966
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:22,832
Oh god! The rave.

967
01:09:44,332 --> 01:09:45,832
Give me two whiskeys, yeah?

968
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:51,832
Insane.

969
01:09:52,082 --> 01:09:53,082
What?

970
01:09:54,708 --> 01:09:56,916
This is insane!

971
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:59,958
What... What? It’s not your scene?

972
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:03,625
Come on, look at
this place! It’s beautiful.

973
01:10:05,666 --> 01:10:06,916
I don’t know.

974
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:12,625
I always saw the world
in shades of black and white.

975
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,625
And now there is all this color!

976
01:10:19,333 --> 01:10:21,458
Yeah. It’s funny that
you say that because...

977
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:25,458
...I just feel like there’s
so much color...

978
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:28,500
Now, I finally see a bit
of black and white.

979
01:10:46,625 --> 01:10:47,375
Hey!

980
01:10:47,458 --> 01:10:48,875
Vishnu Das is shooting up.

981
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:50,625
What?

982
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:52,625
Vishnu Das is shooting up!

983
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:54,333
Shooting up?

984
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:57,416
Brown Sugar, baby. Heroin.

985
01:10:58,083 --> 01:10:59,458
Maggie, this is...

986
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:01,541
Aren’t you a little bit curious?

987
01:11:03,041 --> 01:11:04,000
Maggie this is not...

988
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,333
I want you to do this with me...

989
01:11:05,416 --> 01:11:06,708
Maggie, listen!

990
01:11:06,791 --> 01:11:08,375
Under any other circumstances...

991
01:11:08,708 --> 01:11:10,875
...maybe I would have
But this but this...

992
01:11:10,958 --> 01:11:13,125
What? Speak up!
I can’t hear you.

993
01:11:13,291 --> 01:11:15,291
Maggie! It is not a
good idea, come on...

994
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,583
What is wrong with you?

995
01:11:20,833 --> 01:11:21,916
Whatever.

996
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:44,541
Welcome to the twilight zone.

997
01:11:52,166 --> 01:11:54,166
Nice place.

998
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:12,041
Are you afraid, sweetheart?

999
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:21,833
Fear is the mother of morality.

1000
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:52,666
It’s my first time.

1001
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:55,708
I’ll be gentle.

1002
01:13:13,416 --> 01:13:15,666
What the fuck... What’s
going on here?

1003
01:13:18,166 --> 01:13:20,041
- Figs!
- Hey! Stay groovy.

1004
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:22,125
Vishnu Das! Grow the fuck up.

1005
01:13:25,458 --> 01:13:26,458
Show me your hand...

1006
01:13:26,541 --> 01:13:28,541
What is this?
This is dangerous!

1007
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:31,000
Who the hell do
you think you are?

1008
01:13:31,208 --> 01:13:33,208
Who me? I’m your friend, Figs.

1009
01:13:34,416 --> 01:13:36,375
Well, I was chilling.

1010
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:40,666
- Chilling... You call this chilling?
- Yeah.

1011
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:44,375
Ok, Ms. Rebel-without-a-cause,
go... Go! Chill...

1012
01:13:46,583 --> 01:13:47,875
Hypocrite.

1013
01:13:48,833 --> 01:13:50,083
What?

1014
01:13:50,333 --> 01:13:52,541
You heard me!
You’re a hypocrite.

1015
01:14:01,958 --> 01:14:03,083
Maggie, listen!

1016
01:14:03,416 --> 01:14:05,416
First of all, I care
for you, all right?

1017
01:14:05,583 --> 01:14:07,500
And second of all, you
shouldn’t be messing with this!

1018
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:10,083
It’s dangerous stuff.
Maggie, you’re crazy or what?

1019
01:14:11,125 --> 01:14:13,125
What’s going on
with you, Maggie?

1020
01:14:44,125 --> 01:14:45,416
- Niz!
- What the hell was that?

1021
01:14:46,125 --> 01:14:47,416
- Niz!
- What the fuck was that?

1022
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:49,458
Nothing. Take it easy.

1023
01:14:49,541 --> 01:14:50,416
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

1024
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:51,541
Calm down...
Whoa! easy man!

1025
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:52,500
Fucking easy!

1026
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:54,125
Niz!

1027
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:59,333
Niz... Come on,
Niz! Stop it.

1028
01:14:59,666 --> 01:15:00,958
Niz! Niz!

1029
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:06,041
Nothing happened,
ok, nothing--

1030
01:15:08,125 --> 01:15:10,750
You know, I tried really hard to
be what you wanted me to be.

1031
01:15:12,416 --> 01:15:13,708
And I did it because
I loved you.

1032
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:21,375
But I guess love is just
a four letter word.

1033
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:30,041
Fine! You’re not even worth it.

1034
01:16:09,458 --> 01:16:11,458
Oh God...

1035
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:31,750
Where is everyone?

1036
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:44,916
Excuse me. Where did they go?

1037
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:46,708
- Who?
- The others I was staying with.

1038
01:16:46,791 --> 01:16:47,708
I don’t know what
you are talking about.

1039
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:49,666
- Did they leave a message?
- I don't know.

1040
01:16:50,583 --> 01:16:52,041
Hello stranger!

1041
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:54,916
Hey, Maggie!
Where were you?

1042
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:57,416
I was going to wake you but...

1043
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:58,875
...then I decided against it.

1044
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:03,333
Ouch, you poor thing.

1045
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:06,125
Anyway, come, let’s go...

1046
01:17:06,208 --> 01:17:06,916
Where to?

1047
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:09,250
Come, get your bags.
 Let’s get out of here!

1048
01:17:10,958 --> 01:17:11,666
What?

1049
01:17:13,208 --> 01:17:13,958
Say something...

1050
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:18,375
Where’s Jay? Where’s Niz?
What's going on?

1051
01:17:19,875 --> 01:17:20,458
I don’t know...

1052
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:22,166
I think they left.

1053
01:17:41,666 --> 01:17:42,958
It’s not the end of the world.

1054
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,083
Where are you going?

1055
01:17:48,541 --> 01:17:49,416
I don't know.

1056
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:53,333
We could go anywhere,
someplace far away...

1057
01:17:56,708 --> 01:17:58,708
You just let them leave?

1058
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:03,041
I didn’t let them do
anything, ok?

1059
01:18:03,333 --> 01:18:04,333
They just did.

1060
01:18:05,583 --> 01:18:06,875
And who cares anyway?

1061
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:12,708
Maggie, what’s the
matter with you?

1062
01:18:13,541 --> 01:18:14,625
What’s the matter with me?

1063
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,708
So this is all my fault now?

1064
01:18:18,083 --> 01:18:18,875
Typical.

1065
01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:21,000
You know you created
such a mess last night.

1066
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,125
And I was only trying
to help you...

1067
01:18:25,583 --> 01:18:27,958
You try so hard to stand out...

1068
01:18:29,041 --> 01:18:30,583
...and because of that
at the end of the day...

1069
01:18:30,666 --> 01:18:32,208
...you are just another conformist.

1070
01:18:34,458 --> 01:18:35,250
Am I?

1071
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,791
So what does that
make you then?

1072
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:42,833
Bye Maggie.

1073
01:18:45,458 --> 01:18:46,666
Figs, come on!

1074
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:48,458
It’s you and me...

1075
01:18:56,625 --> 01:18:57,416
So what?

1076
01:18:58,791 --> 01:18:59,875
That’s it then?

1077
01:19:03,041 --> 01:19:03,916
Yeah.

1078
01:19:07,583 --> 01:19:08,916
Look, Figs!

1079
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:12,041
I know I fucked up...

1080
01:19:12,625 --> 01:19:15,375
...and everything was a big mess...

1081
01:19:18,416 --> 01:19:19,875
...but you’re my friend.

1082
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,166
You’re supposed to
be there for me.

1083
01:19:27,625 --> 01:19:28,458
Maggie look...

1084
01:19:30,125 --> 01:19:31,458
...you know I’m always
there for you.

1085
01:19:32,416 --> 01:19:33,083
But...

1086
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:37,750
...just this time I think you are going to
 have to figure this out on your own.

1087
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:40,458
I am sorry.

1088
01:20:27,916 --> 01:20:31,333
Sir. It’s time to check out!
You need to leave.

1089
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:35,666
What are you saying?

1090
01:20:35,875 --> 01:20:37,708
- I’ll leave in half an hour.
- No, sir. Right now.

1091
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:39,625
- Half an hour!
- No, sir. Right now!

1092
01:20:39,791 --> 01:20:40,500
Ok.

1093
01:21:26,833 --> 01:21:27,791
Tea?

1094
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:29,416
Yeah.

1095
01:21:32,083 --> 01:21:33,250
Nice eye.

1096
01:21:37,375 --> 01:21:38,375
Thanks.

1097
01:21:39,541 --> 01:21:40,916
Maggie left.

1098
01:21:42,416 --> 01:21:43,625
So did Niz.

1099
01:21:44,583 --> 01:21:45,583
Oh.

1100
01:21:47,041 --> 01:21:50,083
He told me to tell you he is
 sorry for knocking you senseless.

1101
01:21:51,083 --> 01:21:52,208
Yeah.

1102
01:21:52,625 --> 01:21:53,875
No hard feelings?

1103
01:21:56,208 --> 01:21:57,416
Anyway.

1104
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:03,625
Figs, I know what happened
last night wasn’t your fault.

1105
01:22:03,791 --> 01:22:05,041
Oh, really?

1106
01:22:06,791 --> 01:22:10,083
We’re ok, just so you know.

1107
01:22:11,833 --> 01:22:13,083
Are you sure about that?

1108
01:22:17,041 --> 01:22:18,541
I think so.

1109
01:22:19,291 --> 01:22:23,416
Yeah. It just feels like some
kind of weird nightmare.

1110
01:22:25,166 --> 01:22:27,166
As the old adage goes...

1111
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,625
...‘shit happens’.

1112
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,625
Look, I’m not promising anything.

1113
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:41,666
You don’t have to.

1114
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,166
I screwed up.

1115
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,833
I thought you would
have left with Niz.

1116
01:22:56,166 --> 01:22:57,500
I almost did...

1117
01:23:02,125 --> 01:23:04,125
...but here we are.

1118
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:07,250
Indeed.

1119
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:13,916
I... I don’t really know
 how to say this...

1120
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:16,333
I’m not good at
expressing myself.

1121
01:23:19,583 --> 01:23:21,125
But I stayed...

1122
01:23:21,791 --> 01:23:22,791
...because...

1123
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:30,458
...because I wanted to.

1124
01:23:56,041 --> 01:23:57,375
I’m catching a bus in a bit.

1125
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,041
A bus? Where are you going?

1126
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:02,833
You heard about that
resort they are building?

1127
01:24:04,666 --> 01:24:07,583
An entire village is going
to be completely destroyed...

1128
01:24:07,875 --> 01:24:09,750
...and unless someone does
something about it.

1129
01:24:10,791 --> 01:24:13,708
The government’s been
paid off, surprise-surprise!

1130
01:24:14,833 --> 01:24:16,916
Don’t tell me you want to go
and save the world after this?

1131
01:24:21,041 --> 01:24:21,958
Anyhow...

1132
01:24:22,958 --> 01:24:25,208
Thupten says they need
all the help that they can get.

1133
01:24:25,708 --> 01:24:28,000
Marie Sartre is there.
She is covering the protest and...

1134
01:24:28,333 --> 01:24:31,208
...since our road trip has come
to this untimely end...

1135
01:24:34,416 --> 01:24:35,458
...we should go.

1136
01:24:36,083 --> 01:24:38,125
We should help in
whatever way we can.

1137
01:24:40,791 --> 01:24:42,083
Sounds boring.

1138
01:24:45,583 --> 01:24:48,125
But after all we’ve been through...

1139
01:24:49,458 --> 01:24:51,416
I think boring is
exactly what I need.

1140
01:24:53,708 --> 01:24:55,083
Let’s go!

1141
01:25:18,958 --> 01:25:22,208
<i>We are burning embers in a</i>
<i>world of deepening shadow...</i>

1142
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:25,666
<i>...and the road we tread on has no end.</i>

1143
01:25:28,208 --> 01:25:30,208
<i>But there is still the sky...</i>

1144
01:25:30,916 --> 01:25:34,750
<i>...the windy mountain and</i>
<i>the river below it.</i>

1145
01:25:37,833 --> 01:25:38,916
<i>So let’s tread on.</i>

1146
01:25:40,166 --> 01:25:43,125
<i>Let’s climb to the highest</i>
<i>peaks of our dying kingdom.</i>

1147
01:25:43,791 --> 01:25:45,333
<i>For there is still the sky...</i>

1148
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:47,458
<i>...the windy mountain...</i>

1149
01:25:48,125 --> 01:25:49,166
<i>...and the river below it.</i>

1150
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:05,250
There’s nobody here.

1151
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,625
Ok, who is this journalist
we are looking for, again?

1152
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,375
Marie Sartre.

1153
01:26:19,291 --> 01:26:21,208
Any relation of Jean Paul?

1154
01:26:22,083 --> 01:26:22,833
Ha ha.

1155
01:26:27,416 --> 01:26:30,916
Excuse me! Hello.

1156
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:32,250
Hello.

1157
01:26:34,458 --> 01:26:37,791
I don’t see anybody around,
where did the villagers go?

1158
01:26:38,458 --> 01:26:39,708
Go that way...

1159
01:26:39,833 --> 01:26:40,625
That way?

1160
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:43,791
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

1161
01:27:47,375 --> 01:27:50,958
Mr. Hariharan! We’ve tied
 around 800 Rakhis so far.

1162
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:53,916
Really! Good job.

1163
01:27:55,291 --> 01:27:56,833
- We are almost done.
- Yes.

1164
01:27:57,791 --> 01:27:59,458
These two have come from Delhi.

1165
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:00,625
Perhaps from the media.

1166
01:28:01,041 --> 01:28:01,833
What do you want?

1167
01:28:02,041 --> 01:28:04,833
Nothing! We’re here to help you.

1168
01:28:04,958 --> 01:28:06,416
We’re not from the media.

1169
01:28:07,416 --> 01:28:08,791
Marie Sartre?

1170
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:10,916
That’s me! Hi.

1171
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:14,083
Hi, my name is Jayshri Bose.

1172
01:28:14,416 --> 01:28:15,791
That’s Figs.

1173
01:28:16,166 --> 01:28:17,916
We heard through a
friend that you were...

1174
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,583
...in the area and about
what’s going on here.

1175
01:28:19,666 --> 01:28:22,166
And we thought we
could, well, volunteer?

1176
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:26,625
Excellent. Welcome on board.

1177
01:28:27,208 --> 01:28:28,000
Thank you.

1178
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:30,041
This is my dear friend
Ram Hariharan.

1179
01:28:30,125 --> 01:28:30,791
Hello.

1180
01:28:31,083 --> 01:28:33,083
He’s chief coordinator
 of the Resistance.

1181
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:35,416
That’s what we call ourselves.

1182
01:28:36,583 --> 01:28:40,750
Why don’t you brief them.
I have to file a petition. Ok?

1183
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,250
It’s a throwback to
the 'Chipko movement'.

1184
01:28:48,333 --> 01:28:51,750
These Rakhis are symbolic of
both protest and protection.

1185
01:28:56,208 --> 01:29:00,833
So what exactly is going to happen
if this resort does get built?

1186
01:29:01,625 --> 01:29:04,666
Well a lot of things...

1187
01:29:05,458 --> 01:29:07,291
In a nutshell,
this resort will signal...

1188
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:10,750
...the death of the people of these
hills and of the forest they love.

1189
01:29:14,208 --> 01:29:17,041
We’ve had some recent
success in stalling the project...

1190
01:29:17,375 --> 01:29:18,708
...but unfortunately...

1191
01:29:18,958 --> 01:29:20,250
...we just found out that...

1192
01:29:20,333 --> 01:29:23,666
...the Environment Ministry has
given the go ahead for the resort.

1193
01:29:24,458 --> 01:29:26,833
They are expected to start
pulling down trees...

1194
01:29:26,916 --> 01:29:28,125
...and seizing land...

1195
01:29:28,666 --> 01:29:30,875
- ...any day now.
- That's terrible.

1196
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:32,791
But, I mean...

1197
01:29:33,666 --> 01:29:36,208
...how can they give a go ahead
like this? That’s so strange.

1198
01:29:36,625 --> 01:29:39,166
Political pressure,
vested interests.

1199
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:41,291
Most importantly, moolah!

1200
01:29:41,791 --> 01:29:45,000
Everyone can be bought
 if the price is right.

1201
01:29:49,291 --> 01:29:53,666
Don’t mind my asking but
aren’t you a journalist?

1202
01:29:54,375 --> 01:29:55,416
Yes.

1203
01:29:56,916 --> 01:30:01,958
So shouldn’t it be part of your
 job to be non-partisan...

1204
01:30:02,041 --> 01:30:04,375
...or unbiased or whatever
 it is you guys call it?

1205
01:30:05,708 --> 01:30:08,083
Well, I’ll leave this
to the Indian media...

1206
01:30:08,291 --> 01:30:10,791
...since they seem to be
doing such a great job.

1207
01:30:11,458 --> 01:30:12,916
Good one.

1208
01:30:14,625 --> 01:30:16,291
There is a difference, you know...

1209
01:30:16,375 --> 01:30:19,916
...between being biased and
 being true to yourself.

1210
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:25,083
There is a difference
between hyping a cause...

1211
01:30:25,708 --> 01:30:29,125
...and passionately advocating
a cause you believe in.

1212
01:30:36,458 --> 01:30:37,500
Radha...

1213
01:30:37,958 --> 01:30:39,500
Here! This is for you...

1214
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:46,625
That’s enough.

1215
01:30:46,833 --> 01:30:49,416
Eat! Tomorrow’s a big day.

1216
01:31:00,666 --> 01:31:01,708
Roti, anyone?

1217
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:03,916
Yes, please.

1218
01:31:09,458 --> 01:31:10,291
Marie.

1219
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:14,500
I’ve been meaning to tell you this...

1220
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:17,500
Don’t really know how but...

1221
01:31:18,041 --> 01:31:20,250
I really admire your writing.

1222
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:23,750
What you say, your words...

1223
01:31:24,791 --> 01:31:25,958
...they’re honest.

1224
01:31:26,708 --> 01:31:29,625
And that’s just so rare.

1225
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:33,375
It’s amazing to
finally meet you!

1226
01:31:34,208 --> 01:31:35,125
Thanks.

1227
01:31:35,666 --> 01:31:37,458
I’m glad to meet
both of you too.

1228
01:31:38,541 --> 01:31:40,500
It’s good to know
we are not alone.

1229
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,208
So how long have you been here?

1230
01:31:46,333 --> 01:31:48,083
For some months now.

1231
01:31:49,416 --> 01:31:51,416
It sounds crazy.

1232
01:31:56,875 --> 01:32:00,541
It’s obvious that things are
not how they should be.

1233
01:32:01,166 --> 01:32:05,583
The value of our methods and
means of protest is less obvious.

1234
01:32:06,875 --> 01:32:08,000
Time will tell.

1235
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:12,458
We are nothing but a moment’s
sunlight fading in the grass.

1236
01:32:18,125 --> 01:32:20,875
I have no idea what that
means but it sounds beautiful!

1237
01:32:23,375 --> 01:32:24,458
Marie...

1238
01:32:24,875 --> 01:32:26,625
...what made you
 fight for this cause?

1239
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,041
What cause?

1240
01:32:28,375 --> 01:32:32,041
I believe in saving these
 people and their forest.

1241
01:32:32,458 --> 01:32:33,791
What about the bigger picture?

1242
01:32:33,916 --> 01:32:36,291
What about corruption
in India in general?

1243
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:39,166
Do you think we can fight that?

1244
01:32:40,291 --> 01:32:41,000
I do...

1245
01:32:41,625 --> 01:32:44,083
...but with a pinch of salt,
you might say.

1246
01:32:44,750 --> 01:32:45,750
What do you mean?

1247
01:32:46,458 --> 01:32:48,375
I believe in the potential
of the cause.

1248
01:32:49,458 --> 01:32:52,500
We stand witness to the
birth of a real revolution.

1249
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:54,625
I believe in that.

1250
01:32:56,458 --> 01:33:00,500
So, what brought you two here
to this picturesque battlefield.

1251
01:33:03,208 --> 01:33:04,375
Is everything ready?

1252
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,250
Yes, it’s all ready.

1253
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:09,583
We are filing another petition.

1254
01:33:09,916 --> 01:33:11,708
It won’t make a difference.

1255
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:14,666
In any case, we will
demonstrate tomorrow!

1256
01:33:15,125 --> 01:33:16,916
Can we help in any way?

1257
01:33:17,291 --> 01:33:18,833
Of course! We also
want to do something!

1258
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:19,750
Yes.

1259
01:33:19,875 --> 01:33:22,000
We will need all the
help we can get.

1260
01:33:24,291 --> 01:33:25,125
All right then...

1261
01:33:26,166 --> 01:33:27,500
...let’s all gather in the morning.

1262
01:33:30,541 --> 01:33:34,208
Are there going to be a lot of people
 at this demonstration tomorrow?

1263
01:33:34,458 --> 01:33:37,791
Villagers and activists, lawyers
and other professionals...

1264
01:33:38,291 --> 01:33:42,291
...farmers and truck drivers, teachers
and students like yourselves.

1265
01:33:42,875 --> 01:33:44,958
The revolutionaries of modern India.

1266
01:33:48,125 --> 01:33:49,791
Do you think it’s going
to make a difference?

1267
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:51,125
Who knows?

1268
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:54,416
The fact of the matter is that
we are taking a stand...

1269
01:33:54,916 --> 01:33:56,041
...and that’s important.

1270
01:33:56,666 --> 01:33:59,208
It’s one thing to call
yourself a revolutionary...

1271
01:33:59,291 --> 01:34:01,458
...and quite another
thing to live like one.

1272
01:34:03,583 --> 01:34:04,708
People have enough
things in the world...

1273
01:34:04,791 --> 01:34:07,333
...to be really pissed about
right now, I know that.

1274
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:14,000
But... I just wonder what
this struggle is doing...

1275
01:34:14,125 --> 01:34:16,291
...for the people of this village.

1276
01:34:16,875 --> 01:34:18,791
And that’s scary.

1277
01:34:21,416 --> 01:34:24,750
Well this movement makes
sense to me in the now.

1278
01:34:25,583 --> 01:34:27,125
That’s why I support it.

1279
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,375
Fair enough for you, I suppose.

1280
01:34:30,416 --> 01:34:31,333
Still hungry?

1281
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:32,083
Thanks.

1282
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:32,750
No.

1283
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:38,833
But I could really use a
drink right about now!

1284
01:34:39,375 --> 01:34:40,291
Really?

1285
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:46,125
That should do...

1286
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:48,000
Oh, yes, thank you!

1287
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:01,458
<i>"If I've a babe in town, Babe."</i>

1288
01:35:01,625 --> 01:35:05,333
<i>"It's just when you're around, Babe."</i>

1289
01:35:05,458 --> 01:35:07,833
<i>"If I've a babe in town, Babe."</i>

1290
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,875
<i>"It's just when you're around, Babe."</i>

1291
01:35:11,125 --> 01:35:13,583
<i>"I caught a long slow freight, Babe."</i>

1292
01:35:13,916 --> 01:35:17,250
<i>"Bound out for Texas state, Babe."</i>

1293
01:35:17,375 --> 01:35:20,916
<i>"I caught a long slow freight, Babe."</i>

1294
01:35:21,083 --> 01:35:24,000
<i>"Bound out for Texas state, Babe."</i>

1295
01:35:32,958 --> 01:35:33,791
Marie?

1296
01:35:45,166 --> 01:35:46,583
Oh.

1297
01:35:49,166 --> 01:35:51,458
<i>"Three days I hung around, Babe."</i>

1298
01:35:51,625 --> 01:35:54,666
<i>"That lonesome Texas town, Babe."</i>

1299
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:56,041
Let’s dance?

1300
01:35:57,041 --> 01:35:58,125
No, I can’t.

1301
01:35:58,708 --> 01:36:01,416
<i>"Said you was sick and low, Babe."</i>

1302
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:05,666
<i>"Said you was dyin' slow, Babe."</i>

1303
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:10,916
<i>"Said you was sick and low, Babe."</i>

1304
01:36:11,875 --> 01:36:12,958
Oh...

1305
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:41,208
<i>"I took my car yet , Babe."</i>

1306
01:36:41,291 --> 01:36:43,583
<i>"So as to return to you, Babe."</i>

1307
01:36:43,916 --> 01:36:46,416
<i>"I took my car yet , Babe."</i>

1308
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:49,875
<i>"So as to return to you, Babe."</i>

1309
01:36:50,166 --> 01:36:52,708
<i>"When I got off that train, Babe."</i>

1310
01:36:53,208 --> 01:36:56,041
<i>"You couldn't call my name, Babe."</i>

1311
01:36:56,208 --> 01:36:58,875
<i>"When I got off that train, Babe."</i>

1312
01:36:59,166 --> 01:37:02,416
<i>"You couldn't call my name, Babe."</i>

1313
01:37:24,791 --> 01:37:29,166
This forest has given me life...

1314
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:35,291
...and I shall stand by it till I die.

1315
01:37:37,041 --> 01:37:38,375
My brothers and sisters...

1316
01:37:38,625 --> 01:37:42,250
...they call this project Paradise Found.

1317
01:37:42,666 --> 01:37:45,875
But I call it Paradise Lost!

1318
01:37:46,166 --> 01:37:47,750
Our forests will be cut...

1319
01:37:47,916 --> 01:37:52,041
...our land stolen, our homes broken!

1320
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:55,583
A state that attacks
her own people...

1321
01:37:55,708 --> 01:37:59,000
...is a state doomed
to self-annihilation!

1322
01:38:00,666 --> 01:38:01,541
My brothers and sisters!

1323
01:38:02,416 --> 01:38:05,750
They say this resort is a
symbol of development.

1324
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:09,750
At what cost?

1325
01:38:10,208 --> 01:38:12,583
The death of our forest?

1326
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:14,916
The death of our villages?

1327
01:38:15,708 --> 01:38:18,250
At what cost?

1328
01:38:18,541 --> 01:38:21,166
This resort is not a
symbol of development...

1329
01:38:21,416 --> 01:38:24,750
...it is a symbol of corruption!

1330
01:38:26,458 --> 01:38:29,750
My brothers and sisters, rise!

1331
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,083
Embrace our trees!
Save them from death...

1332
01:38:35,333 --> 01:38:39,041
It is the wealth of our hills.

1333
01:38:40,875 --> 01:38:45,291
We won’t let them build this resort!

1334
01:38:45,375 --> 01:38:47,875
Ma’am, what is the
civil society doing about this?

1335
01:38:47,958 --> 01:38:53,666
We won’t let them build this resort!

1336
01:38:53,875 --> 01:38:55,416
Are you willing to go to jail for this?

1337
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:56,541
No comments.

1338
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:03,583
Thank you.

1339
01:39:06,291 --> 01:39:10,708
Friends. Today is a dark day.

1340
01:39:12,083 --> 01:39:17,791
The illegitimate government of
India has declared war upon us!

1341
01:39:19,250 --> 01:39:23,041
This luxury resort is the
bastard child of greedy politicians...

1342
01:39:23,166 --> 01:39:25,083
...and urban decadence.

1343
01:39:25,416 --> 01:39:29,125
It is a modern day mockery
of our age old values!

1344
01:39:29,583 --> 01:39:32,250
An insult to our Gandhian ways.

1345
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:36,291
The people of these
 hills, they are victims.

1346
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,208
They are victims of a
malaise which afflicts us all.

1347
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:44,875
That malaise is corruption.

1348
01:39:45,666 --> 01:39:48,916
They are the ones to be
sacrificed at the altar of avarice.

1349
01:39:49,458 --> 01:39:53,000
Mark my words,
we shall have revenge.

1350
01:39:53,666 --> 01:39:57,958
Let the ruling classes tremble
 at the prospect of revolution.

1351
01:39:58,958 --> 01:40:02,375
India against corruption!

1352
01:41:37,041 --> 01:41:39,416
<i>What does it mean to be</i>
<i> a revolutionary?</i>

1353
01:41:40,458 --> 01:41:42,041
<i>The war rages on...</i>

1354
01:41:43,958 --> 01:41:46,791
<i>We were knocked down by the</i>
<i>crushing force of a terrible defeat.</i>

1355
01:41:47,916 --> 01:41:50,375
<i>The futility of our actions</i>
<i>was only too obvious.</i>

1356
01:41:52,291 --> 01:41:55,166
<i>The extent of our insignificance</i>
<i>proved absolute.</i>

1357
01:41:57,541 --> 01:41:59,500
<i>If only I had stayed on...</i>

1358
01:42:01,125 --> 01:42:04,291
<i>But what could we do?</i>
<i>It was over.</i>

1359
01:42:06,916 --> 01:42:08,875
<i>What does it mean</i>
<i>to be a revolutionary?</i>

1360
01:42:10,166 --> 01:42:12,208
<i>The war rages on...</i>

1361
01:42:16,375 --> 01:42:18,708
<i>I was wrong when I</i>
<i>thought I was free...</i>

1362
01:42:20,583 --> 01:42:23,166
<i>...we are all enslaved in</i>
<i>chains of our own making.</i>

1363
01:42:25,125 --> 01:42:27,458
<i>What does it mean</i>
<i>to be a revolutionary?</i>

1364
01:42:28,625 --> 01:42:30,125
<i>The war rages on.</i>

1365
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:55,083
We’ve come a long way...

1366
01:42:56,166 --> 01:42:57,958
...but there’s no destination in sight.

1367
01:43:01,208 --> 01:43:02,916
Faith is the bird...

1368
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:06,625
...that feels the light
when the dawn is still dark.

1369
01:43:08,625 --> 01:43:10,000
That’s deep.

1370
01:43:11,250 --> 01:43:12,291
Thanks...

1371
01:43:13,666 --> 01:43:14,916
It’s not me, it’s...

1372
01:43:15,958 --> 01:43:17,958
...Rabindranath Tagore.

1373
01:43:20,791 --> 01:43:22,625
But it’s frustrating,
you know, all the same.

1374
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:26,666
What is?

1375
01:43:28,416 --> 01:43:30,250
It’s been sixty years
since independence...

1376
01:43:31,250 --> 01:43:34,500
...and we’re still fighting
for the same thing...

1377
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:37,083
...for our freedom.

1378
01:43:41,666 --> 01:43:43,208
Someone once said...

1379
01:43:43,791 --> 01:43:48,500
..."When the power of love
overcomes the love of power..."

1380
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:51,666
"...that’s when the world
will know peace."

1381
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:54,916
Who said that?
Rabindranath Tagore, only?

1382
01:43:57,416 --> 01:43:58,500
Close.

1383
01:43:59,583 --> 01:44:01,083
Jimi Hendrix.

1384
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:18,208
We lost it, right?

1385
01:44:19,625 --> 01:44:21,333
Yeah. I guess so...

1386
01:44:25,833 --> 01:44:28,208
What is 'it'?

1387
01:44:32,666 --> 01:44:34,791
You know, we’ve lost
 this battle I suppose.

1388
01:44:35,416 --> 01:44:37,250
But you know
as well as I do Jay...

1389
01:44:37,708 --> 01:44:41,000
...that there’s a
thousand people fighting...

1390
01:44:41,083 --> 01:44:43,708
...a thousand battles
every single day...

1391
01:44:43,791 --> 01:44:45,375
...in this crazy country of ours.

1392
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:52,750
I wonder where those two are.
Niz and Maggie.

1393
01:44:59,208 --> 01:45:00,458
I don’t know...

1394
01:45:03,250 --> 01:45:05,250
...but I’m glad you are with me.

1395
01:47:06,666 --> 01:47:08,083
What happened?

1396
01:47:09,291 --> 01:47:10,500
Where the hell are we?

1397
01:47:16,625 --> 01:47:17,583
Do you have any water?

1398
01:47:54,416 --> 01:47:55,875
Did you see that?

1399
01:47:56,833 --> 01:47:57,708
No, did you?

1400
01:48:47,708 --> 01:48:51,083
<i>"I am a poor wayfaring stranger..."</i>

1401
01:48:57,500 --> 01:49:01,750
<i>"Wandering through this world of woe."</i>

1402
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,875
<i>"And there's no sickness,</i>
<i>no toil or danger..."</i>

1403
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:20,458
<i>"In that bright land</i>
<i>to which I go."</i>

1404
01:49:26,708 --> 01:49:30,083
<i>"I am going there</i>
<i>to see my sister."</i>

1405
01:49:31,458 --> 01:49:34,875
<i>"I’m going there</i>
<i>no more to roam."</i>

1406
01:49:36,625 --> 01:49:39,916
<i>"I am only going over Firdaus."</i>

1407
01:49:41,083 --> 01:49:44,708
<i>"I am only going over home."</i>

1408
01:50:11,125 --> 01:50:14,000
It’s been quite the journey, Figaro.

1409
01:50:15,791 --> 01:50:17,500
It certainly has, Miss Bose.

1410
01:50:20,333 --> 01:50:21,708
How do you know it’s over?

1411
01:50:23,291 --> 01:50:24,791
I never said it was.

1412
01:50:30,250 --> 01:50:31,500
Here we are...

1413
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:35,583
And now what?
