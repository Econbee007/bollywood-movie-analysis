1
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:55,125
Long years ago we made
a tryst with destiny.

2
00:01:55,458 --> 00:02:00,458
And now the time comes
when we shall redeem our pledge.

3
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:06,333
Not wholly or in full measure,
but very substantially.

4
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:12,375
It marks the fulfillment of
the destiny of the Muslim nation...

5
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:18,750
...which has laid great sacrifices in
the past few years to make Pakistan.

6
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,750
At the beginning of the partition of the
country people were migrating...

7
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:26,042
...from both sides of the border.

8
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:29,417
More than 25 lakh people had come from
Pakistan to Delhi from Nirmal...

9
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:32,917
...Monkumri, Beerpur,
Lahore... through Amritsar...

10
00:02:33,042 --> 00:02:36,750
...Ferozpur and Bikaner.

11
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:39,750
Whereas nearly the same
number of people...

12
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,167
...from India from Uttar Pradesh,
Punjab, Haryana...

13
00:02:42,417 --> 00:02:46,292
...Himachal Pradesh and other different
states had reached Karachi...

14
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:49,917
...Mirpur, Sukul and Lahore.

15
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:09,667
'Let the lines remain as it is.'

16
00:03:09,917 --> 00:03:12,750
'Maybe someone had
drawn it in rage.'

17
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:19,667
'Make it a court and let's
play 'Kabaddi' (An Indian game).'

18
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:22,875
'Let the lines remain as it is.'

19
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,042
'You come to my side
and challenge me.'

20
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,625
'Smack my hand and run.'

21
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:35,375
'I will catch you,
cling to you, pull your leg.'

22
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:37,792
'And not let you go back.'

23
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:45,750
'When I come to your side,
you also catch me.'

24
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:51,042
'Don't let me touch
the boundary line.'

25
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,417
'That someone had drawn in rage.'

26
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,917
'Make it a court and
let's play 'Kabaddi'.'

27
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:05,417
'Let the lines remain as it is.'

28
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,042
'Let the lines remain as it is.'

29
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,958
Water.

30
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,875
Water.

31
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,458
Yes, sir.

32
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,750
Are you fine, sir?

33
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,000
Shut up. Were you fleeing? - No.

34
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,958
File. I want the file. - File?

35
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,125
The file of the tunnel
from Delhi to Lahore.

36
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,708
There... in the Indian post.

37
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,458
Wake them up.

38
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:12,708
Whom, sir?

39
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:16,500
Your scoundrel comrades.
They are sleeping.

40
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:17,458
Wake them up.

41
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:22,875
No, sir. They are Pakistani
soldiers. They are dead.

42
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:26,375
Did you die? - No. I am alive.

43
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,250
So go. Get the file
from the Indian post.

44
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,833
Go.

45
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,750
Me? - Who else? Me? You fool.

46
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,250
Can't you see? I have been shot.

47
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,708
I should go alone, sir?

48
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,250
You should have brought your father.

49
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,875
Sir, I will bring help. - Not help.

50
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,749
I want the file. I want the file.

51
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,833
Immigrant.

52
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,000
Bring it, son.

53
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,833
This is your chance.
God has given you the chance.

54
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,250
To prove yourself a true Pakistani.

55
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,375
Go.

56
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:20,500
Show your country that
you are a true Pakistani.

57
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:21,750
Go.

58
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:31,625
Go. Otherwise I will prove
that your entire family is traitor.

59
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,750
A burden on our country.

60
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,167
Go.

61
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:40,917
Yes, sir.

62
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,042
Are you going...

63
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:17,917
Sir, the firing has been
going on for the past one hour.

64
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,292
Are you sure?

65
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,375
I am sure. I mean, why will I lie?

66
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:25,292
They must have gone for a stroll.

67
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:27,667
Exactly, sir.
They go for a stroll everyday.

68
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,792
But they return
within 15-20 minutes.

69
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,292
But today it's been
more than an hour.

70
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,667
Sir, I am scared.

71
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:42,167
Sir, did you hear the firing?

72
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,625
Sir, what do I tell you?

73
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:51,875
There are 'Dadu' in their backside.

74
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:53,500
In which language
are you talking today?

75
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:54,792
What is 'Dadu'?

76
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,667
'Dadu'...

77
00:09:58,167 --> 00:09:59,667
God bless you.

78
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:03,875
Sir, in Punjabi language
frog is called 'Dadu'.

79
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,667
There are many of them.

80
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,542
They fire at trivial matters.

81
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:11,042
And there are many
of them in this area.

82
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:13,250
Shut up. - What? Yes. Yes, sir.

83
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:15,292
Be alert. I will do something.

84
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:19,667
Sir, I am alone here.
How can I be alert?

85
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,542
A soldier is never alone.

86
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,375
Entire India is with him.

87
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:28,500
Yes. Fine. You are right. But...

88
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:30,417
But I am alone.

89
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:32,750
If you are afraid,
why did you join the army?

90
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:36,250
I have joined the army to cook.

91
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:40,042
I am a cook. I cook food. - Shut up.

92
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,750
What? - We will find
out about your comrades.

93
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:44,667
Yes. - Inform me
if you get any news.

94
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,917
A cook can't use his brains.

95
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,292
There is no water. I will fetch it.

96
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:16,125
What will he lose?

97
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,667
God, protect me.

98
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,292
O Lord. O Lord.

99
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:31,250
Why have they made it so far?

100
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:01,667
Raghu.

101
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:04,167
Help! Help! - He...

102
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,125
I think there is only one.

103
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,417
Mister.

104
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:58,542
Brother.

105
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:05,500
Sir.

106
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,917
You have not come to drink water,
have you?

107
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:17,167
I mean, are you thirsty, sir?

108
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,167
Or have you lost your way?

109
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:31,792
Look, if somebody loses his way,
even if he is a Pakistani...

110
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:33,792
...I don't say anything to him.

111
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:34,917
I swear.

112
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:40,917
If you want, you can leave quietly.

113
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:45,792
O Lord.

114
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,250
I am telling you. Leave quietly.

115
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:02,125
I promise you.
I won't say anything to you. Leave.

116
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:05,667
And I won't tell anyone.

117
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:08,375
To whom will you tell, you fool?

118
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,625
I have killed everyone.

119
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:16,167
All are sleeping peacefully.

120
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:17,917
Are you listening?

121
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:19,917
I have not come to leave.

122
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,750
I have come to take the file. File.

123
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:23,792
Moron.

124
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,125
Are you listening?

125
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,375
Give me the file quietly.

126
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:32,291
If you want to live.

127
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,917
Otherwise I will fire ceaselessly.

128
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,625
In a minute you will
go straight to heaven.

129
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:38,667
What file?

130
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,042
The tunnel file.

131
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:45,000
It has the map of the tunnel.

132
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,250
What file?

133
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:47,792
Which tunnel?

134
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:52,292
The tunnel that you are digging
from Red Fort to Lahore.

135
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:53,750
You have taken everything from us.

136
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,125
At least leave this for us.

137
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,875
Brother, I swear on God.
I don't understand anything.

138
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,875
Give me the file quietly.

139
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:02,792
What file?

140
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,458
The tunnel, the digging,
these are what officers do.

141
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,333
How will a cook like
me know about all this?

142
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,708
My job is to cook.
Not to dig a tunnel.

143
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,583
You fool, you are a cook?

144
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:19,750
Yes.

145
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,500
Look. Unnecessarily I was scared.
Tell me.

146
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,458
Look, I don't argue with cooks.

147
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,583
Tell me. Where is the file?

148
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:36,250
I swear on my mother.
I don't know anything about the file.

149
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,833
Nothing.

150
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,250
Okay. What can you cook? Tell me.

151
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,958
Everything.

152
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,583
Okra.

153
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,958
Bitter gourd. Mince meat.

154
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,583
I can cook anything you want.

155
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:52,083
Fine. I will make you
cook in the Pakistani army.

156
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,875
Cook well.

157
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,750
Personally I love
potato stuffed flatbread.

158
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,875
Yes.

159
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,625
I suggest join hands with me.
Come with me to Pakistan.

160
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,833
You will lead a luxurious life.

161
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,250
Are you listening?

162
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,458
Moron. - You fool.

163
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,875
You... I am talking
to you affectionately.

164
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,333
And you are firing.

165
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,500
You have showed you are a cook.
- Your father is a cook.

166
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,458
You will make me cook.

167
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,750
Call me a cook once more.

168
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:31,250
Change my name if I
don't teach you a lesson.

169
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,375
Cook. - You...

170
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,000
Come in front of me.

171
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,000
You are scared now?

172
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,083
You fool.

173
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,625
Scoundrel. Rascal.

174
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,875
You soldier!

175
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,250
Will you capture my country?

176
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,333
Why are abusing me? Am I abusing you?

177
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,000
I am talking to you so affectionately.

178
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,875
Where did you go, Harban Singh?

179
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:03,625
I called you brother.

180
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,375
You don't understand our feelings.

181
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,750
We gave you everything.

182
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,000
You didn't do any favor on us.

183
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,500
You loaded your pockets
and gave us a few pennies.

184
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,125
On top of that bloodshed.
- Who did bloodshed?

185
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,708
Scoundrel.

186
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,625
Did you send a truck full
of dead bodies? Or did we send it?

187
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,875
Read the newspaper.

188
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,375
The first truck came from India,
bathed with blood.

189
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,750
You didn't even spare children.

190
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,625
You also read our newspaper.

191
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,250
Why should I read the newspaper?

192
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:35,833
With my own hands I have
picked up my kin's pieces.

193
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,583
Didn't we?

194
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,875
We are still searching
for our relatives.

195
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,125
You wanted to make your
own political parties.

196
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:46,833
Scoundrel.

197
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,750
What political parties
did we Hindus make?

198
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,375
Hindus and Muslims
are still living together...

199
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,875
...in every neighborhood.

200
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,375
Come and count.

201
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,333
And they are happy too.

202
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,375
Happy my foot.

203
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Why don't you come and ask them?

204
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,500
Some of your relatives
must still be here.

205
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,875
They are cowards who
are still staying here.

206
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,375
I will never even look at them.

207
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,833
Keep quiet.

208
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,333
Tell me. What do you want?

209
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,500
Right. My right.

210
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:19,208
What right? Tell me.

211
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,750
This land is ours. It's our right.

212
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:29,500
Come. It's in my pocket.
Come and take it.

213
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,875
Look, give me the tunnel file quietly.
I will leave.

214
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,125
Get lost.

215
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,625
Keep quiet.

216
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,625
Come and take it.
I told you. It's in my pocket.

217
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,125
He...

218
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,125
Are your bullets over? Pakistani!

219
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,250
I have enough for you.

220
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,333
Nonsense. Nothing is enough for you.

221
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,750
Those whose intention is bad,
their lives are rancorous.

222
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,375
Give us our right. Equal right.

223
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,625
We gave it to you as per your stature.

224
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,083
Okay. What is our stature? Tell me.

225
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,583
Not a penny more than 45 crores.

226
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,750
We appealed.
That's why you got 65 crores.

227
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,250
We didn't get even Rs.65.

228
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,625
Why are you telling us?
We gave it to you.

229
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,750
Take it from your fathers.

230
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,375
Who took the decision?

231
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:37,083
Even your Mr. Nehru never doubted
Mr. Jinnah's intention.

232
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,625
That's why we gave it
to you as an elder brother.

233
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,000
Had you considered
us your elder brother...

234
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,333
...Pakistan would
have never been created.

235
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,208
You know? He is so ill nowadays.

236
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,375
I know. I also read the newspaper.

237
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,875
When he was so aged,
what was the need to enter politics?

238
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,000
He would have taught you something.

239
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:02,500
He was more worldly-wise
than your Mr. Nehru.

240
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,458
We called him uncle Nehru.

241
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,458
But you turned out
to be his real nephew.

242
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,875
He had come to my school.

243
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,625
I gave him two roses.

244
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,250
Others gave him one.

245
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,708
He was a capable man.

246
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,500
That's why you also
gave him two roses.

247
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,250
You should have told your
relatives about his capability.

248
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,250
We wouldn't have had
to see this day today.

249
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,500
It was just a small issue.
But you were so stubborn.

250
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,375
Give it to us. We want this.

251
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,125
What small issue?

252
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,125
It all happened for political seats.

253
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:39,208
Ruined everything for that.

254
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,875
I lost everything.

255
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,333
Otherwise I wouldn't
have been standing here...

256
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:48,708
...and arguing with you.

257
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,125
I would have also not
been arguing with you.

258
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,875
I am not a cook.

259
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,250
I have a huge mansion in Lahore.

260
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,000
My father was a moneylender.

261
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:04,375
I had 100 servants like you.

262
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,500
They would massage my father's feet.

263
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:08,500
And here, my status is nothing.

264
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,333
Yes. Everybody was a moneylender.

265
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,250
Where in Lahore?

266
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:20,750
Anarkali Bazaar.

267
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:26,875
Go to Red Mosque and then
from Akbari lane go straight.

268
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,000
And ask anyone.

269
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,625
You will find Nehle Shah's mansion.

270
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,375
Liar.

271
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,375
You captured Lahore.

272
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,625
And we are liars.

273
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,625
Okay. Fine.
I will find out right away.

274
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,000
You know Afzal Qureshi?

275
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:46,208
He is an aged man.
Give him some respect.

276
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,750
At least say uncle Afzal.

277
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:52,083
His son Rizwan and
I were childhood friends.

278
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,458
We have celebrated
'Eid'(Muslim festival)...

279
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,500
...and 'Diwali'
(Hindu festival) together.

280
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,458
What nonsense!

281
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:59,083
He had seized yours' colony.

282
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,708
He said, "I will give
it to those whom it belongs."

283
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,750
When the matter will cool down,
they will come.

284
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,374
As if we will allow you to come.

285
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:10,374
We won't come. Get lost.

286
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,250
Take your Pakistan
that you have created.

287
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:18,125
You are talking about seizing.
It's not called seizing.

288
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,125
It's called maintaining friendship.

289
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,375
Listen. It's not friendship.

290
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,250
He wanted to give
it to his loved ones.

291
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:30,083
Yes. When he was thrashed,
he ran away.

292
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:31,333
Talk respectfully.

293
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:35,208
Uncle Afzal would have died.

294
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:39,750
But not let scoundrels
like you touch any of the houses.

295
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,250
We had handed it to him.

296
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,208
Saying we will come back.

297
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,000
What did we know?
We will have to stay here.

298
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:53,375
My father wrote to him
saying we can't come now.

299
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,583
That's how you got our houses.

300
00:24:57,625 --> 00:24:58,875
Through custodian.

301
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:02,083
When you had so much affinity,
why did you leave?

302
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:09,000
You scoundrel.

303
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:16,583
Hey, Pakistani.

304
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:04,750
Watchman.

305
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:20,250
Are you sleeping?

306
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:34,625
Did you die during the night?

307
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,500
He is not talking.

308
00:28:06,958 --> 00:28:09,125
The potatoes are delicious.

309
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:13,000
You are giving your
brother a measly meal.

310
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,958
You should have prepared
stuffed flatbread.

311
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:19,708
Delicious.

312
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:22,250
May God grant you 15 minutes of life!

313
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:24,125
What else are you feeding me?

314
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,875
Want bullets?

315
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,750
Tell me.

316
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,125
Want it on your face or on your back?

317
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:37,083
Is it your father's wedding feast?
You scoundrel.

318
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:40,500
You fool.

319
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:42,833
If you had any bullets,
would you have thrown potatoes?

320
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:50,000
Where is it?

321
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:59,833
Don't be under this misunderstanding,
Pakistani.

322
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,625
I have so many bullets.

323
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,250
So many ammunitions.

324
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,250
How many ammunitions do you have?

325
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,625
Why should I tell you?

326
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:15,250
One bullet is enough for you.

327
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:18,458
Fine. Forget this account.

328
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:22,500
Tell me. How long will
you make me sit here?

329
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:25,833
If you are scared, why don't you flee?

330
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:31,208
Take your Allah's name,
race and reach Pakistan.

331
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,125
Otherwise you will die.

332
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,250
I won't leave without the file.

333
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:37,375
Change my name.

334
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:44,250
So sit there. What do I care?

335
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:47,500
Our troop has left from there.

336
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:52,250
When they are going to shoot your
backside, than you will see the tunnel.

337
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:57,875
Later don't tell
me I didn't inform you.

338
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:04,500
You fool. Even my troop is coming.

339
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:08,250
Not one.
But four of them. From all sides.

340
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:12,375
I am not afraid of any troop.
Scaring me with a troop.

341
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:16,875
Let it be.

342
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:19,833
You will have to pay a huge price.
Let me tell you.

343
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:22,625
You also will have
to pay a heavy price.

344
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,375
Why do you want to die?

345
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:30,750
Don't you get it?

346
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:33,250
Listen.

347
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,500
Let's make a settlement.

348
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:38,500
Give me the file quietly.

349
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:40,500
You go to your home
and I will go to my home.

350
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:41,500
Okay?

351
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,083
Look, I will give you nothing.

352
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:51,708
If you need it, you tell me.
What will you give me?

353
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,833
Look, listen to me.
I am not in the mood to fight.

354
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,875
Will you take my chain?

355
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:08,000
What chain?

356
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:11,250
It's my wife's.
I got it during my marriage.

357
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:13,250
You fool.

358
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:15,500
Is it silver or gold? Tell me.

359
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,875
It's silver. Pure silver.

360
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:19,000
Weighing 29 grams.

361
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:20,375
You can open your own hotel.

362
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:25,958
No. No. I think if
I have to open a hotel...

363
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:31,750
...I will need at least 70 grams.

364
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:34,833
If I had 70 grams,
what would I be doing here?

365
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,708
Okay. Tell me. What else do you have?

366
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:47,833
Watch .

367
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,333
It's working?

368
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,250
It works 24 hours.

369
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,249
There are 12 hours in a watch.

370
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,000
Yours works 24 hours?

371
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,250
Yes. I mean the same thing.

372
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:02,500
Tell me the time.

373
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:05,208
6:30.

374
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:09,250
It's 7:00 in my clock.

375
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:11,000
Your watch is not functioning.

376
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:15,375
Yes. You are half an hour ahead of us.

377
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:21,875
Thank God. At least you admitted.

378
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:25,625
That we are ahead of
you and you are behind us.

379
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:27,083
Right?

380
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,958
If you accept the deal, tell me.
Otherwise end the matter.

381
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,833
Fine. Do one thing.
Throw the watch and the chain.

382
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:38,875
First throw the file.

383
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,125
Why are you laughing?

384
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:47,500
Do you need the file or do I need it?

385
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:49,458
I do.

386
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:51,333
Tell me.

387
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:54,125
You or me?

388
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,750
What if you go back on your word?

389
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:01,208
Don't talk childishly.

390
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:04,000
I never go back on my word.

391
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:06,458
Soldiers are brothers, even
if they belong to different countries.

392
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,958
An upright father's
son is also upright. Okay.

393
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,250
Come on. Throw it.

394
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,750
Fine. I believe you.

395
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:24,625
Take out the file.

396
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,875
I also prefer peaceful means.

397
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,667
Have you found it?

398
00:34:12,792 --> 00:34:14,917
Pal, the watch isn't that flashy.

399
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:17,750
Do you want to check
the time or some dance?

400
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:18,792
Come on, throw the file.

401
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:21,000
What:

402
00:34:21,917 --> 00:34:23,125
Throw the file.

403
00:34:25,292 --> 00:34:26,292
What file?

404
00:34:30,792 --> 00:34:32,375
Look, don't turn your back on me.

405
00:34:33,542 --> 00:34:36,042
No, really. Which file?

406
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:40,041
We're brothers. Don't be a rascal.

407
00:34:40,042 --> 00:34:43,042
I've always been
a rascal to you, isn't it?

408
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:44,667
So I have become one for real now.

409
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:46,500
You've showed your true colours.

410
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,042
Give me the file quietly.

411
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,042
Come. The file is at my back side.

412
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:53,167
Come and lick it a little.
You'll get it.

413
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,792
Come on, baby.

414
00:34:54,917 --> 00:34:56,541
Darn you. I curse you.

415
00:34:56,542 --> 00:35:00,667
So be it. I am ready to
get cursed for my motherland.

416
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:02,292
It's no big deal.

417
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:05,500
You can't get away with this.
You rascal.

418
00:35:05,542 --> 00:35:07,417
I will. I will.

419
00:35:07,542 --> 00:35:11,042
I saved you. So anything is possible.

420
00:35:11,167 --> 00:35:12,792
We are really tough.

421
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:15,042
Darn you. I am calling you my brother.

422
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:16,292
Shut up.

423
00:35:16,917 --> 00:35:20,167
Brother, my foot!
He was trying to buy me.

424
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:23,542
Killed me!

425
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:37,375
He wants me dead.

426
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:01,542
Spare me!

427
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:06,417
How was it?

428
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,667
You fake. Darn you.

429
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:12,667
It's just a bruise.

430
00:36:14,042 --> 00:36:15,042
On my arm.

431
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:19,417
I took out the arm on
which you are wearing my watch.

432
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,250
That's why my time isn't good.

433
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:24,541
Your intention is not right.

434
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:27,792
You thug. God sees everything, son.

435
00:36:27,917 --> 00:36:31,042
Minor injuries are a daily thing.

436
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:33,042
I am not budging.

437
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:34,292
Remember that.

438
00:36:34,417 --> 00:36:36,667
Okay, son. Don't move. Good on you.

439
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:40,167
If you move, the poison
will spread in your entire body.

440
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:43,917
Your game will be
over in 15-20 minutes.

441
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:45,167
End of story.

442
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:47,167
If you want to live
for half an hour more then...

443
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:48,542
...come with me to Pakistan.

444
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,417
We're half an hour behind you guys.

445
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:54,417
Tell me something.

446
00:36:54,542 --> 00:36:56,542
How will you cook food?

447
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:00,250
How will you pee?

448
00:37:00,792 --> 00:37:02,917
How will you clean your bum?

449
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,167
Now tell me.
This is how I am going to clean it.

450
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:23,667
"Stories are long."

451
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:29,542
"Talks are done with bullets."

452
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:35,542
"Words hurt."

453
00:37:43,417 --> 00:37:49,292
"The stories are weird."

454
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:54,042
"The blood is mixed in the mud."

455
00:37:54,292 --> 00:37:58,792
"The saints lose their lives."

456
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:24,292
"Crazy men roam in the borders."

457
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:28,792
"An axe is hit on the legs."

458
00:38:28,917 --> 00:38:34,292
"The doors are closed."

459
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:50,250
"There is blood on the borders."

460
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,542
"There is no account of lives."

461
00:38:56,167 --> 00:39:00,792
"There is no account of lives."

462
00:39:00,917 --> 00:39:06,917
"Bits of destiny are found."

463
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:15,542
"Hit the lines on the head."

464
00:39:16,542 --> 00:39:21,917
"The lamps at the mosque
are extinguished."

465
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:28,792
"The lamps at the mosque
are extinguished."

466
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:36,667
"The terraces have broken
and fallen."

467
00:40:23,042 --> 00:40:25,417
Why haven't the potatoes
turned sweet yet?

468
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:32,792
This is being discussed in
the whole of Dehradun these days.

469
00:40:34,042 --> 00:40:37,375
The bears ran away. And the potatoes
have turned out to be brilliant.

470
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:41,417
These days people
say so even in Faislabad.

471
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:44,917
This means you'll take
care of the yield there.

472
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:47,500
And I will take care
of the yield here.

473
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:52,750
The climate is the same.

474
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:55,042
Yes, pal.

475
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:59,542
Sukhnal, we've had good rains.

476
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,542
The sun too has been good.

477
00:41:04,042 --> 00:41:08,042
But it rises half
an hour early in India.

478
00:41:11,542 --> 00:41:14,792
Give me the watch. It's my father's.

479
00:41:15,292 --> 00:41:19,042
And you don't want the chain?
Of your wife.

480
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:21,542
Don't you love your wife?

481
00:41:22,417 --> 00:41:25,292
You won't, isn't it? - No.

482
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:31,417
Be happy. I give it to you as charity.

483
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,500
Get lost, ungrateful.
I know how charitable you are.

484
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:40,250
We fed you potatoes.
And you gave us bullets.

485
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:41,541
Weren't you ashamed?

486
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:44,167
As if you spared me.

487
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:47,042
The thick blanket saved me. I swear.

488
00:41:47,542 --> 00:41:53,292
And what about the fact
that you've shot me. In the arm.

489
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:56,250
You almost took out my heart.

490
00:41:57,042 --> 00:42:00,750
Those are the marks
of old Delhi's marbles.

491
00:42:04,042 --> 00:42:06,000
Where did you live in old Delhi?

492
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,417
Chandni Chowk. Matiyamahal.

493
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,417
Where is that?

494
00:42:15,042 --> 00:42:21,042
Follow the aroma of the
'Korma'(Dish) at Jama Masjid.

495
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,542
And you will be there.

496
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:27,750
Don't make me hungry. You rogue.

497
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:31,542
Here at the border,
all you get to eat are bullets.

498
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:33,042
Nothing else.

499
00:42:35,542 --> 00:42:37,875
It's been so many days
we have been starving.

500
00:42:40,542 --> 00:42:44,667
The 'Lassi'(Sweet buttermilk)
of Hal Bazaar, Lahore...

501
00:42:45,292 --> 00:42:47,417
...and the meal to boot.

502
00:42:48,292 --> 00:42:52,417
Have the tempered 'Nihari'(Dish)
and go to sleep.

503
00:42:53,917 --> 00:42:57,292
Sleeping like a log
as if I have done...

504
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:01,292
...all the labour work of Lahore.

505
00:43:01,917 --> 00:43:04,292
Read out the newspaper to the elders.

506
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:07,542
And get a penny as a reward.

507
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:09,917
And then go straight to Lal Kuan.

508
00:43:11,417 --> 00:43:13,167
And buy a kite.

509
00:43:13,667 --> 00:43:17,917
And we used to flirt with women.

510
00:43:19,917 --> 00:43:26,167
I had wooed my wife with my couplets.

511
00:43:27,417 --> 00:43:29,542
Tied it under the
sun in the afternoon.

512
00:43:32,167 --> 00:43:37,250
And tied it to the leg of
the cot and went to sleep at night.

513
00:43:39,042 --> 00:43:42,042
And we would find it
right there in the morning.

514
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:46,750
On the minaret of the Jama Masjid.

515
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:51,875
As if it had been talking
to Allah all night.

516
00:43:54,542 --> 00:44:00,375
Kites looks good
under your own sky, pal.

517
00:44:03,042 --> 00:44:09,667
The moon would rise on the
roof as if it would fall on my cot.

518
00:44:17,292 --> 00:44:20,292
Lahore's moon always snubbed me.

519
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,542
Want to exchange your moon with mine?

520
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:42,375
Where are you settled in Delhi?

521
00:44:43,542 --> 00:44:47,042
Not found yet.
I live in a camp as of now.

522
00:44:49,417 --> 00:44:53,667
The vegetable market
near the ice factory.

523
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:57,500
Ishwardas has onions
buried in the ice factory.

524
00:44:58,792 --> 00:45:01,042
He took Rs. 21 from my father.

525
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:03,500
He said he'll get
him a house in Pakistan.

526
00:45:03,542 --> 00:45:05,167
Be wary.

527
00:45:06,292 --> 00:45:08,292
This has happened to everyone.

528
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,042
My mother had kept 40
kilograms of pickle to dry.

529
00:45:14,417 --> 00:45:16,542
Someone must have eaten it for sure.

530
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,667
Let everyone get a taste of it.

531
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,167
Okay, tell me.

532
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:27,500
Who all are there in your family?

533
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:32,250
Wife, my kid and father.

534
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:34,167
And your mother?

535
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:36,792
You guys had cut her into pieces.

536
00:45:37,542 --> 00:45:39,292
You didn't spare mothers either.

537
00:45:40,042 --> 00:45:43,667
Blood was shed
on both sides, isn't it?

538
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:46,167
A bit more on our side.

539
00:45:47,542 --> 00:45:49,542
This is what everyone feels, pal.

540
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:54,167
I suggest.

541
00:45:55,792 --> 00:45:56,792
Go.

542
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:01,292
Go back home.

543
00:46:03,542 --> 00:46:05,542
Look after your father.

544
00:46:08,292 --> 00:46:10,542
Shower your kid with love.

545
00:46:12,292 --> 00:46:16,292
They need you more than the border.

546
00:46:22,042 --> 00:46:23,542
Show yourself.

547
00:46:27,042 --> 00:46:28,542
Come on.

548
00:47:20,417 --> 00:47:22,917
'Border station. Border station.'

549
00:47:23,042 --> 00:47:24,542
'The enemy has shown
his true colours.'

550
00:47:24,667 --> 00:47:26,167
'Despite the ceasefire. Over.'

551
00:47:26,292 --> 00:47:27,792
'We will be stationed here. Over.'

552
00:47:27,917 --> 00:47:30,042
'The neighbouring
posts have been hit.'

553
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,167
'Many of our soldiers have
been killed. Over and out.'

554
00:47:33,792 --> 00:47:35,417
I saw you.

555
00:47:36,417 --> 00:47:39,000
And your bosses have
shown their true colours.

556
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:42,250
You all are not capable of trust.

557
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,542
Do you know the meaning of ceasefire?

558
00:47:45,917 --> 00:47:49,375
If we hug you, you will stab
a dagger in our back.

559
00:47:50,042 --> 00:47:52,042
You are dogs. Dogs.

560
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:56,917
He is quite an artist. That rogue.

561
00:52:21,792 --> 00:52:23,917
Hey you. Pakistani.

562
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:31,542
You've ran out of bullets. Is it?

563
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:41,292
Is this what the Pakistani
army has taught you?

564
00:52:43,917 --> 00:52:45,875
You forgot the bullets?

565
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:52,167
"My car has taken off.
Where has it stopped?"

566
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,875
Come. Come on, son. Come.

567
00:52:55,542 --> 00:52:57,167
I'll feed you flatbreads.

568
00:52:57,292 --> 00:52:59,917
Later don't complain
that I didn't explain to you.

569
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,417
You scrag.

570
00:53:02,167 --> 00:53:05,417
Hey, Pakistani,
the game has turned upside down.

571
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,417
Come on.

572
00:53:06,542 --> 00:53:07,917
Hey. Hey. Darn you.

573
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:14,375
Pakistani, if you hit us with drums...

574
00:53:14,417 --> 00:53:15,917
...we'll hit you with bullets.

575
00:53:16,042 --> 00:53:18,167
Come on out.

576
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:21,542
We are not cowards.
We are no less than anyone.

577
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:24,792
You are dealing with an Indian.

578
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,625
Brother.

579
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,417
You knew that I was coming
to your place for a feast?

580
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:54,792
Mr. Harban had told
me that he wanted to have...

581
00:53:55,792 --> 00:53:57,292
...flatbreads stuffed with potatoes.

582
00:53:58,167 --> 00:53:59,917
That's why I had prepped up.

583
00:54:01,042 --> 00:54:04,417
It's okay.
Brother has made it for his brother.

584
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,417
And the brother ate them.

585
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:08,667
You can't take one's
food away from him.

586
00:54:08,875 --> 00:54:10,167
By the way, you're quite good.

587
00:54:10,292 --> 00:54:10,917
Thank you.

588
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:13,250
Tell me one thing.

589
00:54:15,167 --> 00:54:16,625
You shot me in the head.

590
00:54:16,792 --> 00:54:18,042
What if I had died?

591
00:54:18,167 --> 00:54:19,375
Yes. Yes. - What?

592
00:54:19,417 --> 00:54:22,792
No. No. I mean I made a mistake.

593
00:54:23,167 --> 00:54:25,875
My wife is pregnant. - Yes. Yes.

594
00:54:29,542 --> 00:54:30,500
Give me some water.

595
00:54:30,792 --> 00:54:31,875
Here's your flatbread.

596
00:54:36,792 --> 00:54:37,792
Give me some water.

597
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:40,625
There is no water.

598
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:45,500
Come on, pick up the bucket.

599
00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:57,167
You rogue. Is this a well or a tunnel?

600
00:54:57,375 --> 00:54:59,375
Pull fast. - Done, brother.

601
00:55:05,125 --> 00:55:05,792
Hey!

602
00:55:07,792 --> 00:55:08,375
Keep it here.

603
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:14,167
Rascal.

604
00:55:14,417 --> 00:55:16,917
I had asked you to draw it.
Not to drink it.

605
00:55:17,042 --> 00:55:18,792
Move. Move.

606
00:55:21,917 --> 00:55:22,917
Darn it.

607
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:39,000
Walk straight.

608
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:43,500
You took all the files, right?

609
00:55:44,167 --> 00:55:45,917
You fool.
I am talking to you. - Yes. Yes.

610
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:49,042
Sir, your watch and chain.
- Will take it later, moron.

611
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:51,750
You are not going anywhere. - Yes.

612
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:53,917
Yes.

613
00:55:54,292 --> 00:55:57,750
I swear. Your 'Yes' is very sweet.
- Thank you.

614
00:56:00,167 --> 00:56:02,875
Sir, God bless you.

615
00:56:03,417 --> 00:56:06,542
I have something to say.
If you don't mind.

616
00:56:06,625 --> 00:56:08,417
Look, I am unpredictable.

617
00:56:09,375 --> 00:56:12,375
But still, let me tell you.

618
00:56:13,417 --> 00:56:16,542
There is no tunnel in India.

619
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:21,417
Pakistan doubts India.

620
00:56:21,792 --> 00:56:24,667
You dork. That's why you are a cook.

621
00:56:25,792 --> 00:56:28,750
This is beyond our comprehension.

622
00:56:29,167 --> 00:56:33,875
Son, this is all about
big officers and politics.

623
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:36,917
Yes. Yes. - Yes. Yes.

624
00:56:40,667 --> 00:56:47,917
Brother, our captain.
I mean he is just about okay.

625
00:56:48,542 --> 00:56:50,167
He is just like you.

626
00:56:50,292 --> 00:56:51,750
Go meet him this 'Diwali'(Festival)
as soon as you go back.

627
00:56:51,792 --> 00:56:52,542
Yes.

628
00:56:53,167 --> 00:56:56,417
No. I mean he seems authoritative.

629
00:56:56,917 --> 00:57:02,500
That's why he roped
in soldiers like you.

630
00:57:03,792 --> 00:57:05,875
Hats off to the Pakistan Army.

631
00:57:05,917 --> 00:57:07,167
And look at ours.

632
00:57:07,542 --> 00:57:10,417
What is the word you say? Dork.

633
00:57:10,792 --> 00:57:13,792
Dork. - Yes. Dorks.

634
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:19,292
They didn't believe.
They didn't believe the cook.

635
00:57:19,792 --> 00:57:21,750
I even informed them that the enemy...

636
00:57:22,292 --> 00:57:23,542
I mean the enemy...

637
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:27,167
I mean we were enemies
when we met last night, isn't it?

638
00:57:27,417 --> 00:57:28,375
We aren't now.

639
00:57:30,375 --> 00:57:34,250
I have decided.
- What the hell have you decided?

640
00:57:34,667 --> 00:57:37,667
I will join the Pakistan
army as soon as I return.

641
00:57:37,792 --> 00:57:39,167
Recommend me.

642
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:41,750
I mean even if we
don't find the file...

643
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:45,875
...I will dig a tunnel
from Lahore to Lal Killa.

644
00:57:45,917 --> 00:57:47,417
I am telling you.

645
00:57:48,167 --> 00:57:50,167
How are you going to dig the tunnel?

646
00:57:50,292 --> 00:57:51,417
Darn you.

647
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,500
Drop your 8""-

648
00:57:52,542 --> 00:57:54,417
Burfi. - Drop it.

649
00:57:54,667 --> 00:57:57,167
Burfi. Hello, brother.

650
00:57:57,292 --> 00:57:58,625
Drop the gun.

651
00:57:58,792 --> 00:58:03,667
Thank God. You are here.

652
00:58:03,792 --> 00:58:06,667
He... He...

653
00:58:08,125 --> 00:58:09,375
You saved my life.

654
00:58:09,792 --> 00:58:13,542
Darn you. You want stuffed flatbreads,
don't you?

655
00:58:13,792 --> 00:58:15,000
How about this?

656
00:58:16,375 --> 00:58:17,292
And this.

657
00:58:17,667 --> 00:58:18,792
Darn you.

658
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,792
Brother you. - Get up, you rouge.

659
00:58:21,292 --> 00:58:23,042
Get up. Get up.

660
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,042
Fast.

661
00:58:27,125 --> 00:58:29,750
Pick up the bucket. Pick up the rope.

662
00:58:29,792 --> 00:58:31,292
Draw the water. - No, brother.

663
00:58:32,167 --> 00:58:35,042
You shoot me.
You slapped me. - Come on, brother.

664
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:37,167
I am your slave.

665
00:58:37,292 --> 00:58:40,500
You scrag. You thank you are the boss.

666
00:58:40,542 --> 00:58:42,625
You scrag. Darn you.

667
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:45,042
Hey. Stop. Stop.

668
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,875
Burfi, my brother. You saved me.

669
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:52,167
Look. He has given me a swollen cheek.

670
00:58:52,292 --> 00:58:55,042
You Pakistani. He is a postman now.

671
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:59,542
If he had been in the army,
he would ruin your lives.

672
00:58:59,667 --> 00:59:02,042
Tell him. The rascal.

673
00:59:02,792 --> 00:59:03,792
Shut up.

674
00:59:07,167 --> 00:59:09,042
Burfi. What happened, brother?

675
00:59:10,875 --> 00:59:13,917
You were singing praises of Pakistan.

676
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:17,792
No. - Our soldiers are no good.

677
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:19,417
And their soldiers are very good.

678
00:59:19,542 --> 00:59:21,167
No. Wrong. You are wrong.

679
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:23,542
And you took a you turn the
moment you saw me. - No. No.

680
00:59:23,667 --> 00:59:25,375
You were taking our files. - No. No.

681
00:59:25,417 --> 00:59:26,875
You were taking our files to Pakistan.

682
00:59:26,917 --> 00:59:28,791
Brother, I was just pretending.

683
00:59:28,792 --> 00:59:30,042
I swear. I was pretending.

684
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:32,500
Why did you join the army
if you are fond of pretending?

685
00:59:32,542 --> 00:59:33,792
Darn refugee.

686
00:59:33,917 --> 00:59:35,292
Half Pakistani.

687
00:59:35,417 --> 00:59:37,292
Don't say such things.
Don't say such things, mate.

688
00:59:37,375 --> 00:59:41,042
Mate. I am your mate.

689
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:43,875
That Pakistani is your brother.

690
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:46,042
Dear brother.

691
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,791
Girls have mates. Get it.

692
00:59:48,792 --> 00:59:51,125
What rubbish, brother.

693
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:54,500
You are talking trash
in front of the enemy.

694
00:59:54,542 --> 00:59:56,292
What did you do in front of the enemy?

695
00:59:56,542 --> 00:59:57,625
You ruined everything.

696
00:59:57,667 --> 00:59:59,917
I wish you had died. I so wish.

697
01:00:00,542 --> 01:00:02,917
Darn it. You were taking
the files to Pakistan.

698
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:07,000
I swear.
He had a gun pointing at my back.

699
01:00:07,667 --> 01:00:10,792
I would've never entertained
these dogs otherwise.

700
01:00:12,167 --> 01:00:14,875
I am a hapless man.

701
01:00:14,917 --> 01:00:16,292
Who are you? - No.

702
01:00:16,417 --> 01:00:18,250
A two bit cook.

703
01:00:18,292 --> 01:00:19,917
Are you the colonel?
Or the colonel's son?

704
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,792
Get lost.

705
01:00:22,292 --> 01:00:24,042
Hug him.

706
01:00:24,542 --> 01:00:26,167
Come on. Hug him.

707
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:29,417
Hug your brother. The Pakistani.

708
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:31,375
Darn refugee.

709
01:00:31,917 --> 01:00:35,417
Burfi, how do I convince you?

710
01:00:35,917 --> 01:00:39,542
I have fought all night all alone.
All alone.

711
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:44,792
Ask him. Tell him. Tell him.

712
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:49,417
Hey, what are you doing?

713
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:54,667
Sir, I guess the stuffed
flatbreads didn't get digested.

714
01:00:54,792 --> 01:00:55,750
Stuffed flatbreads?

715
01:00:55,792 --> 01:00:57,042
Where did they come from?

716
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,417
Brother made them.

717
01:01:01,042 --> 01:01:02,917
Really.

718
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,125
You rogue. You never felt like
making stuffed flatbreads for us.

719
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:16,417
Brother. Get your sister married.

720
01:01:18,667 --> 01:01:22,042
Brother, if I knew
I would've never told him...

721
01:01:22,167 --> 01:01:24,250
...that you made stuffed flatbreads
for me with so much love.

722
01:01:24,292 --> 01:01:27,000
You will not call me brother.
Let me tell you.

723
01:01:28,542 --> 01:01:33,000
You fed the hungry.
So what should I call you? Sir.

724
01:01:33,042 --> 01:01:36,542
You dog. I am not talking to you.
I am telling you.

725
01:01:37,667 --> 01:01:39,792
Shame on you.

726
01:01:43,792 --> 01:01:48,417
Don't spit, Burfi.
Believe me, brother. For God's sake.

727
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,792
Believe me. For God's sake.

728
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:56,042
You call me Khoya despite swearing
on your mother a million times.

729
01:01:56,125 --> 01:01:57,667
My name is Burfi Singh.

730
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,542
That was a nickname, right?

731
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:00,667
Nickname?

732
01:02:00,792 --> 01:02:03,875
He lies to even his parents.

733
01:02:03,917 --> 01:02:06,042
He has told them that
he is an officer in the army.

734
01:02:06,167 --> 01:02:08,792
He roams all over Delhi as a hero.

735
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,917
He has made me write letters.

736
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,250
Write to mother.

737
01:02:12,292 --> 01:02:15,417
And tell her that I killed
four Pakistanis today.

738
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,292
One day, he said.
Write that I was unarmed...

739
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:22,292
...but I grabbed the Pakistani.

740
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,625
He wants me to believe him.

741
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,292
Hey. Come on.

742
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:33,167
Why the hell are you staring at me?

743
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:34,500
Get up.

744
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:43,375
Why are you grinning?
Why are you grinmng?

745
01:02:43,542 --> 01:02:44,667
Stop behaving like a kid.

746
01:02:44,792 --> 01:02:46,167
You are behaving like a kid.

747
01:02:47,292 --> 01:02:50,375
Have you gone mad?
Have you gone blind?

748
01:02:50,417 --> 01:02:52,000
Can't you see? I have been shot.

749
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,417
I have fought all night all alone.

750
01:02:55,917 --> 01:02:57,875
You kick me. Sometimes you spit at me.

751
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:01,000
Shoot me. End this.

752
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:02,792
You have turned me into a dog.

753
01:03:02,917 --> 01:03:04,542
You have found your pal. Haven't you?

754
01:03:05,042 --> 01:03:06,375
Shame on you.

755
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:08,375
Brother, I was not laughing.

756
01:03:08,542 --> 01:03:10,042
You will not call me brother.

757
01:03:10,167 --> 01:03:11,750
So what's my fault in this?

758
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:13,917
The captain wants the file.
I gave the watch. The chain.

759
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,167
Darn you. You rascal.

760
01:03:17,292 --> 01:03:19,417
Betrayal is in your blood.

761
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:20,750
I will not spare you.

762
01:03:20,792 --> 01:03:25,417
Hey... Hey... You rascal.

763
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,167
You sold our country
for the watch and chain.

764
01:03:29,667 --> 01:03:31,792
You betrayed the country.

765
01:03:34,792 --> 01:03:36,292
My spectacles.

766
01:03:37,917 --> 01:03:38,917
Pal...

767
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:58,042
Hello. Hello.

768
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:16,625
Pass me the screw-driver.
The screw-driver. - Yes, sir.

769
01:04:17,042 --> 01:04:19,750
You dropped the screw-driver.

770
01:04:19,792 --> 01:04:21,667
You're insulting an Indian tool.

771
01:04:21,917 --> 01:04:23,042
Respect it.

772
01:04:23,917 --> 01:04:25,167
Say, "Forgive me."

773
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:29,667
Forgive me.
- "Forgive me, screw-driver."

774
01:04:31,417 --> 01:04:33,042
Forgive me, screw-driver.

775
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:34,750
Give it.

776
01:04:41,917 --> 01:04:45,125
I will repair it in a second.

777
01:04:47,792 --> 01:04:49,875
Hello. - Hello, head-post 1.

778
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,542
'Border-post 1.' - Border-post 1, sir.

779
01:04:53,125 --> 01:04:55,750
'Is this Burfi Singh,
speaking?' - Yes, sir.

780
01:04:56,042 --> 01:04:57,667
Jai Hind, sir.
Burfi Singh speaking, sir.

781
01:04:57,792 --> 01:05:00,417
'So, Burfi, is everything okay?
- I have been reached here. Yes, sir.

782
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,792
The receiver's been fixed, sir.
I fixed it in a minute.

783
01:05:03,792 --> 01:05:05,417
Sir, I've big news.

784
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:08,167
I've nabbed a Pakistani intruder.

785
01:05:08,792 --> 01:05:10,625
'Pakistani? Are you sure?' - Yes, sir.

786
01:05:11,125 --> 01:05:12,125
He's a Pakistani, sir.

787
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:14,417
We have him, sir.

788
01:05:14,792 --> 01:05:15,792
Don't worry, sir.

789
01:05:16,042 --> 01:05:18,375
Sir, he was stealing the
secret files from the check-post.

790
01:05:18,625 --> 01:05:19,875
We're facing difficulties here, sir.

791
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:25,042
And, sir. I've also caught
a half Pakistani. -'What?'

792
01:05:25,417 --> 01:05:26,750
'Burfi, speak clearly.'

793
01:05:26,917 --> 01:05:29,167
Yes, sir. He's the cook for the unit.

794
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:31,125
We had our suspicion...

795
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:32,792
...that he was working
for the Pakistanis.

796
01:05:33,667 --> 01:05:35,250
After all, he's from that side.

797
01:05:35,667 --> 01:05:36,750
Send the force, sir.

798
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:38,542
And kill them both.

799
01:05:39,542 --> 01:05:41,125
One of them is an intruder...

800
01:05:41,667 --> 01:05:43,000
...while the other one is a traitor.

801
01:05:43,542 --> 01:05:45,250
'Burfi, hold your position.'

802
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:48,667
Yes, sir. -'lt's important
for that Pakistani to stay alive.'

803
01:05:48,792 --> 01:05:50,542
'I'm sending reinforcements.'
- One more thing, sir.

804
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:53,417
Please make me a soldier now.

805
01:05:55,667 --> 01:05:57,542
Together,
I will annihilate all the Pakistanis.

806
01:05:58,042 --> 01:05:59,250
'I will recommend your name, Burfi.'

807
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,792
'Hold your position.' - Yes, sir.
- 'Over and out.'

808
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:01,792
Over and out, sir.

809
01:06:10,917 --> 01:06:15,542
Kumar. Darn post-master.

810
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,167
I won't spare you.

811
01:06:18,417 --> 01:06:19,792
Just watch what I do with you.

812
01:06:23,792 --> 01:06:26,125
And you, you got lucky.

813
01:06:27,292 --> 01:06:32,000
Sir has said he wants
to question the intruder.

814
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:35,042
Sir. - What is it?

815
01:06:35,542 --> 01:06:38,750
Sir, I need to pee.

816
01:06:40,542 --> 01:06:43,000
Come on.

817
01:06:58,042 --> 01:07:03,625
I've a son. A wife. A father.

818
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:07,167
I cannot defame them.

819
01:07:08,292 --> 01:07:10,125
I will have nowhere to go.

820
01:07:11,292 --> 01:07:12,917
You forgot our brotherhood. - Rascal.

821
01:07:13,167 --> 01:07:15,000
Now's the chance.

822
01:07:16,125 --> 01:07:17,792
Let your father find out...

823
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:21,125
...what his great son's
been up to out here.

824
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:24,542
Look, he's running.

825
01:07:57,792 --> 01:07:59,292
Forgive me, sir.

826
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:03,625
Scoundrel.

827
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:05,917
Trying to run away.

828
01:08:06,292 --> 01:08:07,542
You dog.

829
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:09,167
Samarth, water.

830
01:08:11,625 --> 01:08:13,500
Brother, give me some water.

831
01:08:13,542 --> 01:08:14,542
I don't have a bucket.

832
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:16,125
Where is it then?

833
01:08:17,333 --> 01:08:19,125
Ask him who was running away...

834
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:20,125
...where did he throw it.

835
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:26,875
What will an officer
do if he feels thirsty?

836
01:08:28,333 --> 01:08:29,625
Sitting there comfortably.

837
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:32,958
Sit like a rooster.

838
01:08:34,958 --> 01:08:36,875
Sit like a rooster.

839
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:49,958
He's there and he sent
me here to die. - Who?

840
01:08:51,375 --> 01:08:52,458
My captain.

841
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:54,875
Where's your captain?

842
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:56,958
Across the border.

843
01:08:59,708 --> 01:09:02,875
I think they'll dig my
grave before I dig a tunnel.

844
01:09:04,125 --> 01:09:05,958
Sir, I didn't want to come either.

845
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,125
Then why did you?

846
01:09:10,375 --> 01:09:12,333
And why did you try to run?

847
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,125
What were you thinking?

848
01:09:14,958 --> 01:09:17,125
You can escape from Burfi Singh?

849
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:30,750
Mr. Samarth, Are you hatching
your eggs sitting over there?

850
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:35,458
Stand up.

851
01:09:43,458 --> 01:09:45,958
If you dare sit in
front of an officer...

852
01:09:46,208 --> 01:09:49,125
...then you will never
be anything more than a cook.

853
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:02,125
Salute me.

854
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:06,750
Salute.

855
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:11,333
Salute me.

856
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:16,833
Good.

857
01:10:23,375 --> 01:10:25,000
You came here for the file?

858
01:10:25,625 --> 01:10:28,125
Sir, my captain wanted the file.

859
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:31,250
If everything is
needed by your captain...

860
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:34,875
...then have you come here
looking for a groom for your mom?

861
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:38,208
Yes. Yes.

862
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:42,125
A captain's order
is a captain's order.

863
01:10:42,458 --> 01:10:43,583
Has to be carried out.

864
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:45,625
Right?

865
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:48,375
When I become an officer.

866
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:53,375
I am one.

867
01:10:55,458 --> 01:10:58,250
Then you will certainly
follow my order.

868
01:11:08,375 --> 01:11:10,625
Right, Samarth.

869
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:13,625
You will have to follow orders.

870
01:11:14,708 --> 01:11:15,875
What are you staring at?

871
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,625
Don't stare.

872
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:20,875
I would've shot you two.

873
01:11:22,125 --> 01:11:26,750
It's only because I received orders...

874
01:11:27,958 --> 01:11:29,625
...to keep you two alive.

875
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:34,375
That's why I spare your life.
I am sparing your life.

876
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,875
Sir, I will certainly
die under this hot sun.

877
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,125
You think you're that important.

878
01:11:42,333 --> 01:11:44,125
My back's stiffened, sir.

879
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:47,708
Straighten up. Back has stiffened!

880
01:11:57,458 --> 01:11:59,250
I am no less than a dog, sir.

881
01:12:09,833 --> 01:12:12,250
Early in the morning father said
to me that he has to go somewhere.

882
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:15,125
And he did too.

883
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:20,250
But we could never
find out where he went.

884
01:12:22,125 --> 01:12:23,625
So did mother...

885
01:12:26,083 --> 01:12:27,375
...and my sister.

886
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:33,250
But I couldn't find out...

887
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:38,250
...where they all went.

888
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,333
What nonsense is this?

889
01:12:46,875 --> 01:12:50,625
If you knew, Burfi...

890
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,750
...then all this
wouldn't have happened.

891
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:59,250
Someone asked for it, and we obliged.

892
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:04,750
We became dogs. Dogs.

893
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:08,125
From where are we?

894
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,583
We don't even know that.

895
01:13:12,958 --> 01:13:16,708
Its wrong.

896
01:13:18,208 --> 01:13:19,125
Anyway-

897
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:21,875
Forget all this.

898
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,250
Look, Burfi.

899
01:13:25,625 --> 01:13:26,750
How will you understand?

900
01:13:28,708 --> 01:13:34,625
You need a heart
to understand all this.

901
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:37,250
And you don't have one.

902
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,625
Shut up, you traitor.

903
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:41,750
You shouldn't talk about a heart.

904
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:48,000
You shouldn't be hearing it either.

905
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,125
Not at all.

906
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,625
Sir. Sir.

907
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:02,125
What is it?

908
01:14:02,208 --> 01:14:05,500
Sir, you're very intelligent.

909
01:14:07,208 --> 01:14:08,750
I don't want any file.

910
01:14:09,625 --> 01:14:10,750
Let me go.

911
01:14:12,125 --> 01:14:13,875
Who's giving you the file?

912
01:14:14,375 --> 01:14:16,125
Not me, my captain.

913
01:14:16,708 --> 01:14:18,625
Whether it's you or the captain.

914
01:14:18,708 --> 01:14:20,750
You both are Pakistanis.

915
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:25,833
No, sir. I've lived
in Old Delhi for 30 years.

916
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:27,458
I belong here.

917
01:14:28,708 --> 01:14:30,208
I see. - Yes.

918
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:34,583
Come here. - Yes.

919
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:41,083
Where from Old Delhi?

920
01:14:41,625 --> 01:14:42,625
Matiya Mahal.

921
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:44,500
Do you know Majid?

922
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:47,000
The Khamidi bread maker.
- Noor llaiyi's son.

923
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:49,250
Noor llaiyi's son.

924
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:53,125
Rascal.

925
01:14:55,750 --> 01:15:00,125
You stayed here for 30 years.

926
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:02,125
In India.

927
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,333
And then you turned
your faith towards them.

928
01:15:06,625 --> 01:15:07,875
Joined their army.

929
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:10,125
And now you're killing us.

930
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:13,625
You're a dog as well, just like him.

931
01:15:15,625 --> 01:15:17,000
What are you doing?

932
01:15:20,708 --> 01:15:22,125
What's in your bag?

933
01:15:22,875 --> 01:15:25,583
Nothing.

934
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:28,250
What's in your bag?

935
01:15:28,333 --> 01:15:30,375
Put down your bag.

936
01:15:36,458 --> 01:15:37,625
What is it?

937
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:40,833
What else did you give him?

938
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:46,958
What? What is it in his bag?

939
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,125
What is this?

940
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,958
It belongs to my child, sir.

941
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,875
I thought it belongs to your mother.

942
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:30,375
You were saying you don't have water,
bucket, this, that.

943
01:16:48,833 --> 01:16:50,583
Burfi.

944
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:03,083
Look, I don't want any file.

945
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:06,250
Let me go home.

946
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:10,750
Let me go home.

947
01:17:11,208 --> 01:17:12,750
No. Don't let him go.

948
01:17:12,875 --> 01:17:14,124
Hold him for 10-15 minutes.

949
01:17:14,125 --> 01:17:15,833
The reinforcement's on the way.
They will deal with him.

950
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:17,958
I can't see a thing.

951
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,833
Get the medikit. It's in the bag.

952
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:23,875
I will die.

953
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:27,250
Sit down. Have courage.

954
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:29,583
Have courage.
- Do what you want to quickly.

955
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:33,500
Don't lose hope. Don't lose hope.

956
01:17:34,125 --> 01:17:37,333
Don't tell my father. - Just a minute.

957
01:17:37,375 --> 01:17:38,875
Your father has sent a letter.
- Don't tell my father.

958
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,375
Really. Your father has sent a letter.

959
01:17:40,458 --> 01:17:41,875
Just a minute.

960
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,375
Wait. Wait. - Everyone
will call my son a traitor.

961
01:17:47,458 --> 01:17:49,125
Son of traitor.

962
01:17:52,458 --> 01:17:53,958
Just a minute.
- Everyone will call my son a traitor

963
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,583
Listen. Listen.

964
01:17:56,750 --> 01:18:04,500
Father says "Bless you.
May God bless you with happiness."

965
01:18:05,083 --> 01:18:11,708
"We're doing okay,
we manage to sell 20-25 bags a day."

966
01:18:12,625 --> 01:18:15,250
"The paperwork has been completed."

967
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:20,500
"Room no 1056 in Old Delhi,
Chandni Chowk..."

968
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:26,625
"...near the Town Hall,
we got back our home."

969
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,375
"We got back our home."

970
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:33,625
"You... you come back home soon."

971
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:37,625
"Son, now leave the army..."

972
01:18:37,833 --> 01:18:39,875
"...and spend the rest
of your life with us."

973
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,833
"God bless you with happiness."

974
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,875
"We should respect the Lord as well."

975
01:18:47,333 --> 01:18:49,125
"We've received news from Lahore..."

976
01:18:49,833 --> 01:18:52,708
"...Uncle Afzal passed away."

977
01:18:54,958 --> 01:18:56,708
'You know Afzal Qureshi?'

978
01:18:57,125 --> 01:18:58,875
'At least say uncle Afzal.'

979
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,250
'His son Rizwan and
I were childhood friends.'

980
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:10,375
"Tomorrow if you face Rizwan,
you won't be able to shoot him."

981
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:15,375
"This is not our job to do."

982
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:19,500
"We've kin on that side, and this."

983
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:22,125
Sister-in-law has written...

984
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:25,333
hope you're keeping good health."

985
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:27,750
"Everything is fine here."

986
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:32,000
"Mother's not been keeping well."

987
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,000
"We took her to the physician."

988
01:19:35,708 --> 01:19:39,125
"Billa is mischievous all the time."

989
01:19:40,083 --> 01:19:41,875
"He has also learnt to abuse."

990
01:19:43,125 --> 01:19:45,250
"Come and slap him."

991
01:19:46,958 --> 01:19:48,750
"Come and celebrate 'Diwali' with us."

992
01:19:50,125 --> 01:19:53,833
"Billa's birthday's arriving as well.
Bring something for him."

993
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:58,125
"Don't go back again.".

994
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:05,500
"My mind keeps racing,
and the heart's always restless."

995
01:20:06,375 --> 01:20:07,875
"Lajwanti

996
01:20:18,625 --> 01:20:21,208
'I felt like this letter has been
sent from my home.'

997
01:20:25,958 --> 01:20:27,208
Water.

998
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:33,125
Burfi, go get water.

999
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:37,125
Or, he'll die.

1000
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:04,625
Look after him.

1001
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:56,833
What is the name of your child?

1002
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:00,625
Riyaz?

1003
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:05,583
How old is he?

1004
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:11,208
He'll turn four this year.

1005
01:22:15,083 --> 01:22:16,333
And your son?

1006
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:18,958
11 years.

1007
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:24,875
He studies...

1008
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,750
...in the fifth standard.

1009
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:39,833
You didn't tell me your name?

1010
01:22:41,583 --> 01:22:42,625
Rehmat Ali.

1011
01:22:50,833 --> 01:22:54,208
Go back to your home.

1012
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Don't come back here.

1013
01:23:06,625 --> 01:23:09,000
You go home too. - Yes.

1014
01:23:10,125 --> 01:23:14,125
If... I survive...

1015
01:23:18,083 --> 01:23:19,208
Brother.

1016
01:23:20,125 --> 01:23:21,250
Brother.

1017
01:23:22,625 --> 01:23:23,708
Brother.

1018
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:26,333
Brother.

1019
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,125
Brother.

1020
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:31,250
Brother.

1021
01:23:35,125 --> 01:23:36,625
Samarth.

1022
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
He's dead.

1023
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:55,500
Get me water.

1024
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:58,750
There's no water, sir.

1025
01:25:04,125 --> 01:25:05,875
You've been here all night.

1026
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:08,250
And what did you do?

1027
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,083
You couldn't find a file.

1028
01:25:10,708 --> 01:25:12,750
There it is, sir. The file.

1029
01:25:27,833 --> 01:25:29,250
All these files are a waste.

1030
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:31,250
Where is the file with the tunnel map?

1031
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,958
Where's that file of the tunnel?
- It must be in there, sir.

1032
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:01,000
Hey, come here!

1033
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:23,500
Sir, can I make a request.

1034
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:27,375
Pakistan doubts India.

1035
01:26:28,625 --> 01:26:30,208
There's no tunnel.

1036
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:31,458
Nor any file, maybe.

1037
01:26:32,208 --> 01:26:34,625
According to me.

1038
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,083
What nonsense is this? - No.

1039
01:26:39,208 --> 01:26:40,958
All my soldiers are dead.

1040
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:43,583
And you say there's no file.

1041
01:26:43,875 --> 01:26:47,375
Sir, the officers can make a mistake.

1042
01:26:48,625 --> 01:26:53,250
What do you mean?
- I mean the information can be wrong.

1043
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:00,250
I mean such an important
file in this small check-post, how?

1044
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:02,875
I mean...

1045
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,625
These officers...

1046
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,250
These scoundrels
have made our life hell.

1047
01:27:23,125 --> 01:27:24,750
Yes, yes.

1048
01:27:26,125 --> 01:27:28,083
Exactly, sir.

1049
01:27:30,875 --> 01:27:32,958
They didn't even
let me celebrate 'Eid'.

1050
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,500
It's all politics, sir.

1051
01:27:36,708 --> 01:27:38,208
Selfish scoundrels.

1052
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,375
They sit comfortably
at home while we die out here.

1053
01:27:46,375 --> 01:27:48,750
Father wasn't well when I was leaving.

1054
01:27:49,833 --> 01:27:52,625
Wonder... - It'll be fine, sir.

1055
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:55,708
Everything will be fine.

1056
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Yes.

1057
01:27:59,875 --> 01:28:03,000
Both the nations were
talking about peace.

1058
01:28:05,375 --> 01:28:07,458
I thought we'll have
a few days of peace.

1059
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:09,000
Some holidays.

1060
01:28:09,458 --> 01:28:10,708
Yes.

1061
01:28:12,208 --> 01:28:14,000
But this border.

1062
01:28:16,583 --> 01:28:18,750
There would've been a file,
if there wasn't a border.

1063
01:28:19,625 --> 01:28:22,083
I put myself in line
of fire for nothing.

1064
01:28:27,083 --> 01:28:28,500
Why isn't there water here?

1065
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:38,333
Rehmat...

1066
01:28:39,458 --> 01:28:41,458
Sir, he's alive.

1067
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,333
Reh mat.

1068
01:28:48,875 --> 01:28:49,833
Brother.

1069
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:53,000
Brother.

1070
01:28:53,125 --> 01:28:54,208
Traitor...

1071
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:55,958
Siding with the enemy?

1072
01:28:57,833 --> 01:29:00,000
You turned out to be their supporter.

1073
01:29:00,125 --> 01:29:02,000
Traitor.

1074
01:29:03,958 --> 01:29:06,750
Finally you turned out
to be on their side.

1075
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:12,125
Traitor...
officers can make mistakes...?

1076
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:17,250
You'll betray my country?

1077
01:29:28,875 --> 01:29:30,625
Where is the file?

1078
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Where is the file?

1079
01:29:33,333 --> 01:29:35,958
Answer me.

1080
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,958
I'm asking you something!

1081
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:41,000
You won't tell like this...

1082
01:29:42,333 --> 01:29:44,375
Speak.

1083
01:30:15,458 --> 01:30:20,250
"You're not what you seem to be."

1084
01:30:23,125 --> 01:30:26,875
"You don't look, like what you are."

1085
01:30:30,375 --> 01:30:41,458
"You say, it's all a lie.
You're not what you seem to be."

1086
01:30:43,875 --> 01:30:47,750
"You hurt us."

1087
01:30:47,833 --> 01:30:52,125
"And also heal them."

1088
01:30:55,375 --> 01:31:00,583
"Ask me, not yourself."

1089
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:06,458
"You do what you aren't supposed to."

1090
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:13,000
"You're a liar."

1091
01:31:14,083 --> 01:31:17,125
"You're a liar."

1092
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,625
Who shot him?

1093
01:32:33,458 --> 01:32:39,500
"Stories are long."

1094
01:32:40,625 --> 01:32:44,875
"Talks are done with bullets."

1095
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:51,500
"Words hurt."

1096
01:32:56,708 --> 01:33:02,333
"Stories are long."

1097
01:33:02,833 --> 01:33:07,000
"Talks are done with bullets."

1098
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:12,750
"Words hurt."

1099
01:33:20,708 --> 01:33:26,625
"The stories are weird."

1100
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:31,375
"The blood is mixed in the mud."

1101
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:36,833
"The saints lose their lives."

1102
01:33:55,500 --> 01:34:02,000
"Crazy men roam in the borders."

1103
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:09,208
"Crazy men roam in the borders."

1104
01:34:09,625 --> 01:34:13,875
"An axe is hit on the legs."

1105
01:34:14,833 --> 01:34:19,250
"An axe is hit on the legs."

1106
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:24,500
"The doors are closed."

1107
01:34:35,375 --> 01:34:40,833
"There is blood on the borders."

1108
01:34:41,458 --> 01:34:46,208
"There is no account of lives."

1109
01:34:46,833 --> 01:34:51,250
"There is no account of lives."

1110
01:34:51,375 --> 01:34:57,250
"Bits of destiny are found."

1111
01:34:59,708 --> 01:35:07,208
"Hit the lines on the head."

1112
01:35:12,208 --> 01:35:18,083
"Destiny is written on the borders."

1113
01:35:18,625 --> 01:35:23,500
"There is no account of lives."

1114
01:35:23,708 --> 01:35:30,125
"Bits of destiny are found."

1115
01:35:31,375 --> 01:35:35,875
"Stories are long."

1116
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:41,000
"Stories are long."

1117
01:35:42,083 --> 01:35:46,500
"Stories are long."

1118
01:35:47,375 --> 01:35:51,875
"Stories are long."

1119
01:35:52,625 --> 01:35:59,458
"Hit the lines on the head."

1120
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:05,875
"The lamps at the mosque
are extinguished."

1121
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:12,500
"The lamps at the mosque
are extinguished."

1122
01:36:13,833 --> 01:36:20,750
"The terraces have broken and fallen."

1123
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:31,875
"Stories are long."

1124
01:36:33,625 --> 01:36:37,500
"Talks are done with bullets."

1125
01:36:38,333 --> 01:36:44,833
"Words hurt."
