00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,556
The ice hockey game
between Toronto Maple Leads...

2
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:39,120
...and Detroit Red Beats has
been quite interesting so far.

3
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,461
Overtime has been given to them.

4
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:44,196
In this final round, both
the teams have made two goals.

5
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,362
What is this?

6
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,838
The centre of Leads
Rajveer Singh has got the puck.

7
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,201
And he is at the breakaway.

8
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,573
He has crossed the red line.

9
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:54,374
There is nobody
between him and the goalie.

10
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,661
Rajveer Singh
hoodwinked the goalie...

11
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:16,759
...and moved him from his position.

12
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,269
And goal.

13
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:19,430
What a goal!

14
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:23,704
Rajveer Singh has done a miracle.

15
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,643
He won the game like a dream.

16
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:30,114
The crowd is dancing
with delight on the victory.

17
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,529
Mother. Mother.

18
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:53,697
Take this.

19
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,146
Do not fear.

20
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,819
Rajveer.

21
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,125
Rajveer.

22
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,196
Dad.

23
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:23,696
Today...

24
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,296
Today, I am dead.

25
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,766
Dad, what are you doing here?

26
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,275
Working. And you?

27
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,140
You are sleeping.

28
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,470
Have you laid eggs here
that you sleep here every day?

29
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,243
I just took a short nap.

30
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,409
Son, remember.

31
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,252
You can get either success or rest.

32
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,623
If your uncle sees you sleeping,
he will fire you.

33
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,393
Useless fellow, all
this can be yours.

34
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,927
Just once show your
uncle you are capable.

35
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,501
I don't think I will
lose this job, dad.

36
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:58,729
Why do you feel like so?

37
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,272
Which idiot will do this job?

38
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,301
Rajveer, what do you see here?

39
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,303
Trucks.

40
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,347
Be a bit farsighted.

41
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:13,709
Yes, dad. I should
say I see my future.

42
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:17,347
Mr. Darvesh and Mr. Rajveer Singh,
please come to the office.

43
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,559
Come and answer your uncle.

44
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,326
Why do you worry so much, dad?

45
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,521
I can't save you every time.

46
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,190
Uncle Sammy is very cool.
Yes. Uncle Sammy.

47
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,764
You will tell him you
were sleeping in the truck.

48
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,395
You are ashamed. Fine?

49
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,563
Fine.

50
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,942
Uncle Sammy.
Rajveer.

51
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,308
Come in.

52
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,513
Brother, hello.
Hello.

53
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:46,242
Uncle, aunt, sorry. I...

54
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,846
There is good news. Reena is
getting married next month.

55
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,690
Sonu, herfiancÃ©, has
agreed to come to Tornado.

56
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,589
It's God's grace.

57
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,691
Congratulations.
He is a gem.

58
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,425
You will be pleased to meet him.

59
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,594
He is a talented boy.

60
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,795
He is an expert in stock exchange.

61
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,633
You are next, Rajveer.

62
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,667
My niece in
Jalandhar is perfect for him.

63
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,600
Check her out on facebook.

64
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,406
Stop your marriage bureau.

65
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,945
We will conduct
Rajveer's marriage...

66
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,641
...when he will do the entire shift...

67
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,581
...without sleeping in the truck.

68
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,280
Am I right?

69
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,253
He dreams of fair
damsels sleeping in the truck.

70
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,414
Once again congratulations.

71
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,354
Congratulations.
Thank you, brother.

72
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,624
Raj. Raj.

73
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,329
Raj, pass it.

74
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,594
Raj, nobody is here. Pass it.

75
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,333
Raj, here.

76
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,840
Raj, I told you to pass it here.

77
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,004
You gave a good pass.

78
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,479
You want a pass or goal?

79
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,640
Zero, you fool.

80
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,446
Raj, henceforth we will
consider you equal to two players.

81
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,610
There is another option.

82
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,381
Put your stick in
your mouth and play.

83
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,547
This is not possible.
Why?

84
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:59,386
His tongue is very smooth.
Smootherthan his hands.

85
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,687
Do pass it to us at times.
I see.

86
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,523
Hero.
Look. Look. Look.

87
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,296
Who are they?

88
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,325
Leave. Yourtime is up.

89
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,866
We still have10 minutes.

90
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,329
They are Hammerheads.

91
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:10,494
Hammer my foot.

92
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,504
They are barging in. It's our ice.

93
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:13,698
Hammer...

94
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,098
Watch it.

95
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,510
What's your problem?

96
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,807
I don't have any problem.

97
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,110
I am just waiting for you
jokers to leave the ice.

98
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:24,816
Smarty, don't lock horns.

99
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,685
Leave before I lock horns.
Lock horns.

100
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,889
Yourfather locked horns by
bringing you into this world.

101
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,955
So?
- Push. ""Fool.""

102
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:37,924
Yes. What?

103
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,123
Listen.
Yes.

104
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,932
Ensure that your player
doesn't commit a murder...

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,058
...and soil my ice.

106
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,432
Look, I don't want to lock horns.

107
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,828
I just want to score goals.

108
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,605
Two for Raj. And
zero forthe foreigner.

109
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,340
Good shot.

110
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,113
Come on. Lock horns.

111
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,976
Leave.
Stop. Leave.

112
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,143
Raj. Come on. It's over.

113
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,555
Have you gone crazy?

114
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,023
We have come here to
practice ice hockey...

115
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,423
...and not judo or karate.
Fools.

116
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,154
Coach.
Yes.

117
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,453
Shall I try?

118
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,896
I have good players. You
go and play with marbles.

119
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:16,059
Coach, the kid should get a chance.

120
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:18,501
Yes, coach. Let's see
how much guts he has.

121
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,868
Come on.
Fine.

122
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,671
Raj. Come on, Raj.

123
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,772
Come on, Raj. Well done. Well done.

124
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,476
Pass.
Come on.

125
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,838
Pass it here. Hey.

126
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:33,544
There you go.

127
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,579
Raj, you are playing well.

128
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:39,984
Here. Here.

129
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,960
Dan, I have been waiting for
you forthe past half an hour.

130
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,394
Do you want to come with me or not?

131
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,625
Yes. I want to come. I was
watching this Indian player play.

132
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,791
He is not bad.

133
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,463
Lick the glass.

134
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,468
Hey.
He is not that good too.

135
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,773
Hey. Hey.

136
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,070
Come on. Come on. Come on.

137
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,202
Good. Good.

138
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,203
Yes. Come on, Raj. Yes!

139
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,640
Yes

140
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:04,876
Goal!
- Yes!

141
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,510
Come on.

142
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,952
Did you see? I told you. He
is not less than them. - Yes.

143
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:10,819
Yes.
Okay. Enough, kiddo.

144
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,023
Everybody, come. Come on.
This was Enough forthe kiddo.

145
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:17,854
Coach.

146
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,420
Done? That's it.

147
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:20,891
Yes. Over.

148
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,533
I was the best player.

149
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,465
I will send you the
ticket of ourfinal match.

150
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,201
Don't mind. You are
not worthy of this team.

151
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:32,938
Good practice, guys.

152
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,815
Indians don't have any
value in the rink, Raj.

153
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,717
Forget it. It's their loss.

154
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,451
See you.
See you.

155
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,219
Shameless.

156
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,259
But you were playing quite well.
So you were watching.

157
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:53,790
Nonsense.

158
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,130
You are calling hockey nonsense.
Not me. Right?

159
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,168
This is human rights' case.

160
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,162
They were slandering you openly.

161
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,900
Now, I am used to it.

162
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,539
There are rules in Canadian chart...

163
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,237
...of human rights
against such behavior.

164
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,771
What happened? Why are you laughing?

165
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,542
I swear. You look prettier
when you are fuming with rage.

166
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,577
Are you a lawyer?

167
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,713
Almost. I am studying law.

168
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,824
Fine. If you everwant
to save this poor man...

169
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,984
...you will find me here.

170
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,785
Getting beaten.

171
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,621
Who are you?

172
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,661
My brother. The great Dan Winters.
You must have heard about him.

173
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,064
In some season he had played...

174
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,261
...for Red Wings for a few days.

175
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,595
Yes. Four matches.

176
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,502
I think you play well.
Thanks.

177
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,165
When you are not kissing the glass.

178
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,538
You shouldn't have let
them take advantage of you.

179
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,235
Did you hear, lawyer?

180
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,745
Next time save me.

181
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,272
Good. But I don't think
you can afford my fees.

182
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,109
No discount for
friends and relatives?

183
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:47,777
And you are?

184
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:48,979
Your new friend.

185
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,585
Rajveer.

186
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,625
You have started
helping strangers, Melissa.

187
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,129
No. - Since when did
you become my father?

188
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,697
Since the time you
started helping strangers.

189
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,064
Concentrate on your studies.
Thanks forthe advice.

190
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,702
Let's settle one thing.

191
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,598
I am just a tenant in your house.

192
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,037
And you are my hassled brother.

193
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:10,835
Fine.

194
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,605
But curb your social service.

195
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,229
Who died? And where is the body?

196
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,431
Gurveer.

197
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,498
Why did you leave
from work so early?

198
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:44,869
We had our hockey practice.

199
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,172
I had told you.

200
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,410
Mother, today it was great fun.

201
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,749
Today, I played with Hammerheads.

202
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,448
It's a champion team.

203
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,686
They have been winning the Hyundai
cup forfour consecutive years.

204
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:58,985
They took you in theirteam?

205
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,251
No. They didn't.

206
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,590
They didn't take you in theirteam.
But...

207
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,492
I was thinking of retiring
and settling down in Miami.

208
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,225
It was an equal competition, dad.

209
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,427
Competition?

210
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,500
Lavleen, will you ask your son?

211
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,764
Where did the word 'work'
disappearfrom his dictionary?

212
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,001
Son, he means to say...
Tell him.

213
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,508
Had I played cricket,
he would have...

214
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,808
...danced with delight at each shot.

215
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,975
Look, he thinks you...
India is the king of cricket.

216
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,616
Crores of people watch cricket.

217
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,314
Ask him. Does anyone in
India even know about ice hockey?

218
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,447
Look, son. Hockey...
Ask him.

219
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,355
In Canada which
channel shows cricket?

220
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,893
Ask...
My neck is tired.

221
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,690
Shall we eat?
Yes.

222
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,392
I don't know where my
son has disappeared.

223
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,438
I don't know him.

224
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,610
He cut his hair. He
dozes off at work.

225
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:54,646
Mother, tell
fatherto talk lovingly.

226
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,507
Otherwise he will spend his old
age in an old age home... - Raj.

227
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:02,713
Eight dollars.

228
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,691
When I came to this city,
I had only eight dollars.

229
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,350
I provided education to my brother.

230
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:10,418
He converted eight
dollars into eight billion.

231
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,788
I didn't ask anything
from him. Besides a job.

232
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:19,266
And if my son is capable,
he will run his business.

233
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,033
I don't think that
day will ever arrive.

234
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,741
I am there. I am a good son too.

235
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,036
Shut up.

236
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:31,338
If you think you will play
ice hockey, you are mistaken.

237
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:32,675
Don't worry, dad.

238
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,852
As a hockey star's father,
you can retire early.

239
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,822
Then you can rest on a beach and
see bikini... - Stop your nonsense.

240
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,416
Enough.

241
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,585
Henceforth you will
concentrate on yourwork.

242
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,597
And in yourfree time you
will do service in Gurdwara.

243
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,462
Henceforth, no hockey. Got it?

244
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,635
Henceforth, no hockey.
You never saw me playing.

245
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,001
I don't even want to see.

246
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,747
Can I eat his 'Ras Malai' (Sweets)?

247
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,910
Keep quiet and eat yourfood.

248
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,087
Are you fine, brother?
Yes.

249
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,794
Dad says all that
because he loves me more.

250
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,024
I am kidding. You are his brave son.

251
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,399
You do so much drama.
What are you doing? Leave.

252
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,903
""I am your good son.""
Leave, brother.

253
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:27,630
Don't do that.

254
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,136
Fatso. - Don't do it again.

255
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,374
Son, please finish your dinner.

256
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,772
I have lost my appetite, mother.

257
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,340
Son, try to understand yourfather.

258
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,816
I admit he is a bit stubborn.

259
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,487
When you cut your hair,
he kept quiet.

260
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,581
When you left university, he
arranged for a job for you...

261
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,989
...at your uncle Sammy's place.

262
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,118
You also have some duty,
don't you, son?

263
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,056
Please eat.

264
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,994
My darling son.

265
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,708
Come on. Come on.

266
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,078
Pass it here.

267
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:16,713
Pass it here.

268
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:17,881
Come on.

269
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,385
What are you doing?

270
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,118
Take this.

271
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,660
Goal. Yeah!

272
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,194
Ourteam?
Yes.

273
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,165
'Kabbadi' (lndian game).

274
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,631
'Kabbadi'. 'Kabbadi'. 'Kabbadi'.
Shut up.

275
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,940
'Kabbadi'. 'Kabbadi'. 'Kabbadi'.
We can win the Hyundai cup.

276
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,536
What are you saying?

277
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,876
Have you gone crazy?
Okay. Okay. Tip-cat.

278
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,608
You are watching too
many cartoon films.

279
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,984
Raj, we play hockey like kids.
That too very badly.

280
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,883
Rubbish.
Yes. Have confidence, friends.

281
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:53,515
We will give
Hammerheads a tough time.

282
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,650
What do you say?
Fine. Listen.

283
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,558
They are smarter,
speedier, and beefierthan us.

284
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,459
Yes.
Fair-skinned. Have you seen it?

285
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:02,056
Hi, guys.
Hi, Reena. - Hi.

286
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,198
Do you know me? - Bye.

287
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,667
Bye.
Reena is So pretty.

288
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,900
She is my cousin.

289
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,841
Whenever I see her on news,
I wish I was her microphone.

290
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,902
Hindi. Hindi. She has got engaged.
So?

291
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,571
No problem.
And she is not yourtype.

292
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,147
What's my type?
Flirty type.

293
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,108
Hey.
He got angry.

294
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,617
Rajveer, we are leaving.

295
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,578
Everything fine? Take this.
You fool.

296
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,125
Get ready.
Later.

297
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,264
""This is my world, beloved.""

298
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,896
""This is my world.""

299
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,407
""This is my world, beloved.""

300
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,306
""Move, move now.""

301
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,538
""We will not be touched.""

302
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,706
""Got the game on stuck.""

303
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,942
""We cannot be seen.""

304
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,617
Have faith.
I Have faith.

305
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,844
I have full faith
that we will be mocked.

306
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:00,850
What are all of you doing here?

307
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,925
Practicing for Hyundai cup.
Practicing for defeat?

308
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,821
What do you think? We are losers?

309
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:06,990
What do you think?

310
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:08,597
I am the coach of this team.

311
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:15,804
Wow! You will surely
become the coach of the year.

312
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,400
So what should we do?

313
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,335
What do you mean by we?

314
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:23,709
If you know what to do to be
the coach of the year. Teach me.

315
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,409
Guys.

316
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:28,378
Everybody come here.

317
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,879
Come here.

318
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,486
You farted again.

319
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,652
How's it going?

320
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,661
Fine. Perfectly fine.

321
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,827
Your name?
Singh. Deva Singh.

322
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,826
Yours?
Inderjit Singh.

323
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,236
Yours?
Jassi Singh.

324
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:48,762
You are also a Singh?

325
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,372
Right. Rajveer.

326
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:51,735
All of us are Singhs.

327
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,303
So many brothers?

328
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,678
Brothers from different mothers.

329
00:16:58,884 --> 00:16:59,976
Okay.

330
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,980
Singhs.

331
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,790
You have only two options.

332
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,889
Enterthe ice, have fun and lose.

333
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,259
Or be strong, break some
bones and give yourself a chance.

334
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,658
There are two types of hockey.

335
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,296
Hockey that you play on the street.

336
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,659
And real hockey.

337
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:17,861
Watched by entire Canada.

338
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,297
The ice on which it's played,
it's softerthan Rajveer's cheeks.

339
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,276
I don't know whether all
of you can play or not.

340
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,675
But I know how to find out.

341
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,381
Isn't he the ice cleaner?

342
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:33,743
Seems to be him.

343
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,354
""Move, move now.""

344
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,582
""We will not be touched.""

345
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,089
""Got the game on stuck.""

346
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,383
""We cannot be seen.""

347
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,619
""Unstoppable force is
the Indian dream team.""

348
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,663
""You know who we are.""

349
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,993
""We are the Indian royalty.""

350
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,294
""We run the world.""

351
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,460
""This is my world, beloved.""

352
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,833
""This is my world.""

353
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,568
""This is my world, beloved.""

354
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,437
""This is my world.""

355
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,403
""This is my world, beloved.""

356
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,809
""This is my world.""

357
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,607
""This is my world, beloved.""

358
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:04,944
""This is my world.""

359
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,347
Sonu, this is our Speedy Singh.

360
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:11,648
It's nice, sweetie.

361
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:15,017
Shall we leave? I have just landed.
Let me rest for a while.

362
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,323
Darling, my entire
family is waiting for you.

363
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:19,489
They are not going anywhere.

364
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,722
We are Indians. We can
be late. Don't worry.

365
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,495
One moment. It's from
the TV station. Hello.

366
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:25,595
'Desi Tadka'.

367
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:29,505
I have told you so many
times I won't do a cookery show.

368
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:33,534
""Your beloved's truck is
flying through GT Road.""

369
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,376
Son, since you are going
to be my company's driver...

370
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,678
...let me tell you
what you have to do.

371
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,943
Atruck is delicate like a woman.

372
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,682
You should treat her
lovingly and politely. - Okay.

373
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:48,419
Keep her happy. There shouldn't
be a shortage of adornment.

374
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,555
But always drive safely.

375
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,998
You mean, seatbelt, right?

376
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,831
Right, uncle. Okay. Give it a name.

377
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,529
Melissa.

378
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,539
Melissa.
- It's a nice name.

379
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,834
No. It should be a Punjabi name.

380
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,844
Okay. How about Malinder?

381
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:09,840
It's good.

382
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,676
Hello, Malinder.

383
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,011
Come on.

384
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,691
You fool. Is this
how you handle a woman?

385
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,892
Now, I know why you
don't have a girlfriend.

386
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:26,857
Step on the accelerator.

387
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,457
Alright.
- That's it. It has started.

388
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,596
Last time my stomach rumbled...

389
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,797
...so badly that my eardrum exploded.

390
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,863
Brake. Brake.
Where is the brake, uncle?

391
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,698
Reena. Reena.
You are forcing me.

392
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:38,765
Start the car.
Hold on, Sonu.

393
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,936
Start the car.

394
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:42,673
I said I am coming.

395
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,749
I will try to come
as soon as possible.

396
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,647
What is this, Sonu?

397
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,190
You are so petrified
of meeting my dad.

398
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,026
Don't worry. He will like you.

399
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:58,521
Hello.

400
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,791
Did you poke my niece on facebook?

401
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,591
If you poke her, she will like it.

402
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,903
I will do it today.
Look. I Have her photo.

403
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,062
Yes.

404
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,837
Ms. Punjab. Third runner-up.

405
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,838
What is this, aunt? Only third?

406
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,570
She would have won
if the other girls...

407
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,009
...had not slept with the judges.

408
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,444
Why should I keep quiet?
I heard it.

409
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,038
I will tell everybody in school.
Son, no.

410
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,583
She is cute.
Everybody, please pay attention.

411
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,152
He is my Sonu.

412
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,889
Hello. - He is my elder
brother Darvesh Singh.

413
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,221
My sister-in-law Lavleen.
Hello.

414
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:29,783
Hello.
And theirtwo lovely sons.

415
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:30,919
Gurveer and Rajveer Singh.

416
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,255
How are you?

417
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,733
You are so strong. Do
you lift trucks? - Good.

418
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:36,893
You will defeat Khali.

419
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,197
Naughty kid.

420
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,396
Rajveer.

421
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,330
Reena has told me a lot about you.

422
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,306
This is what you call her,
don't you? You call her Reena.

423
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,740
And I call her Sonu's sweetie.

424
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:46,705
You drive truck so well.

425
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,439
I don't know how we survived today.

426
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,409
Next time I will try my best.

427
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,774
Good.

428
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,216
It's good that you left
college forfamily business.

429
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,984
History is the witness that
undergrads have always succeeded.

430
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,857
Sonu, look. Yourwould-be wife.

431
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,924
Wow! - Amazing!

432
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,854
It's looking good on you.

433
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,861
I had ordered it
especially from France. - France.

434
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,664
By sending a Punjabi team for
the famous Hyundai Tournament...

435
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:14,638
...Tornado's Indian community has
created a place forthemselves...

436
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:15,934
...in Canada's national game.

437
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,272
This is Reena Singh from S.I.N.

438
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:19,833
Wow! You look so beautiful.
- Amazing!

439
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:21,837
Rajveer, you are also playing,
aren't you?

440
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,640
Rajveer has decided
to give up hockey.

441
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,815
Now, he has to concentrate
on other important things.

442
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,786
For instance, learning
his uncle's business.

443
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,616
Right, Rajveer? - Yes, dad.

444
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,515
Wow! Nice plan, uncle.

445
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,349
You are perfect forthis.

446
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:36,989
""Move, move now.""

447
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,321
""We will not be touched.""

448
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,921
""Got the game on stuck.""

449
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,290
""We cannot be seen.""

450
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,528
""Unstoppable force is
the Indian dream team.""

451
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,230
""You know who we are.""

452
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,897
Throw it out. ""We are
the Indian royalty.""

453
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,031
""We run the world.""

454
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,035
""This is my world, beloved.""

455
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:52,903
""This is my world.""

456
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,037
""This is my world.""

457
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,508
Come on. Have a meal and come here.
Excuse me.

458
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,310
Excuse me.
The doctor has come.

459
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:03,513
I have taken training in first aid.

460
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:04,885
Maybe he has hurt his head.

461
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:07,652
You look like Katrina Kaif.
What problem do you have?

462
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,353
I hit him softly.
Okay.

463
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,520
Don't worry.

464
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,928
Lie down. You will be fine.

465
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,357
Breathe.

466
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,300
Breathe deeply.

467
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,565
""Come to me.""

468
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:20,969
""Come to me.""

469
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,403
""Come to me.""

470
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:24,908
""Come to me.""

471
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:26,670
""Come to me.""

472
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:28,506
""Come to me.""

473
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,504
""Come to me.""

474
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,449
""Come to me.""

475
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,511
""Come to me.""

476
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:37,020
""Dance and show me, beloved.""

477
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,420
""Come to me.""

478
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,890
""Move yourwaist.""

479
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,085
""Come to me.""

480
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,761
""Come, let us both dance.""

481
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,956
""Come to me.""

482
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:47,723
""Come to me.""

483
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,590
""Dance merrily.""

484
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:53,035
""You are teasing me tonight.""

485
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:56,097
""I want the dance floor by my side.""

486
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,399
""My side.""

487
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:00,604
""I feel like seeing
you day and night.""

488
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:04,370
""Dance with me.""

489
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:07,418
""I also love you.""

490
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:11,311
""Don't you know that my
heart belongs to you?""

491
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,818
""Come to me.""

492
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,325
""Dance and show me, beloved.""

493
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,656
""Come to me.""

494
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,390
""Move yourwaist.""

495
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:20,692
""Come to me.""

496
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,961
""Come, let us both dance.""

497
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,399
""Come to me.""

498
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,029
""Come to me.""

499
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,335
""Come to me.""

500
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,066
""Come to me.""

501
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,035
""Come to me.""

502
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,509
You will enjoy it. Trust me.

503
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,670
Take this.

504
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,839
Move, you fool.
What happened?

505
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,640
I am not interested in kissing you.
Come on.

506
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:42,845
Get up.

507
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,047
Get up. I was giving
you fake CPR. That's it.

508
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,521
Get him out of the ice.

509
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,356
Where did Taj Mahal go?

510
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:48,854
The music stopped?

511
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,553
What?
- What's happening?

512
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,154
You slipped here and
fell into Bollywood.

513
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:54,624
Beloved.

514
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,464
I love you.

515
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,433
I think you have got
a major concussion.

516
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,973
Sorry. I spoke rubbish outside.

517
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,771
You were embarrassing
yourself and not me.

518
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:08,145
How do you feel now?

519
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:09,839
Tell me.

520
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,412
Will you come on a date with me?

521
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,682
I don't date hockey players.

522
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:17,119
You are lucky. I am
a truck drivertoo.

523
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,884
But I don't date them as well.

524
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,390
I will leave both
these things for you.

525
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,484
Especially those
who leave theirwork.

526
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,932
I think locker room
is only for players.

527
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,433
I am waiting for you in the car.

528
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:31,833
How are you now, Raj...

529
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,398
Rajvinder.

530
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,100
Raj is enough.

531
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,505
What is your sister's problem?

532
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:41,876
You think I am your spy?

533
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,807
What have you
thought about coaching?

534
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:49,046
Ten turbaned men.
All ten are Singhs.

535
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,644
I can't pronounce
theirfirst names properly.

536
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,053
They can't skate properly.

537
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:53,181
Leave alone play.

538
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,093
What can be worse than this?

539
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:58,888
It will be a miracle if we
play the first round well.

540
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:03,859
What?

541
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,031
You said we.

542
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:13,042
If it's in your destiny,
what can a person do?

543
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:35,989
Why are you following me?

544
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,360
What do you mean?

545
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,494
Why are you in my
favorite restaurant?

546
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,336
Don't act smart.

547
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,601
My friend praises this place a lot.

548
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,575
I have never eaten Indian food.

549
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,407
I thought I should try it.

550
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,270
How is your head?

551
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,406
You seemed unstable at the rink.

552
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,011
I am sitting in front of you.
I am perfectly alright.

553
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,512
Rajveer.

554
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,049
How are you, son?

555
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:01,553
Is everything fine at home?

556
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,861
Yes, Mr. Patel. Everything is fine.

557
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,791
Meet Melissa.
Hi.

558
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,430
First date?
Yes. - No.

559
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,500
I will consider it a yes.

560
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,629
Okay. Did I hear it right that
you are practicing hockey nowadays?

561
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,673
You are in that team about which...

562
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,503
...your sisterwas talking on TV?

563
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,302
No. No. - Yes. You are.
You are the captain.

564
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:23,944
Think whether you
are the captain or not.

565
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:25,346
If you are, I will
waive today's bill.

566
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,644
Waive today's bill?

567
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,910
Yes. I am the captain.
You heard it right.

568
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,319
What will you have, captain?

569
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,914
If you permit, shall
I place the order?

570
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,294
Okay. Let's begin
with 'Chicken Tikka'.

571
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,523
Good choice.
- 'Tandoori Jinga' (Fish). - Okay.

572
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,293
And mixed fritters.
Okay.

573
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,061
Cottage cheese vegetable. Curry.

574
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,461
And chicken 'Biryani'
(Flavored rice) too.

575
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,004
God bless you. - Afew flatbreads,
garlic and butter.

576
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,502
And rice.

577
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:52,600
And curd salad to keep her calm.

578
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,105
Anything for you?

579
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:56,439
No.

580
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:57,874
This will be enough.

581
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,041
Are you ordering
forthe entire team?

582
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,914
I am afraid it will be less.

583
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,116
Okay. Why were you not
telling him you are in the team?

584
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,093
My father doesn't like this game.

585
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,419
Why?

586
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,328
Have you noticed that
I look different from...

587
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:15,457
...the otherteam members?

588
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,900
Yes. They wear a turban. And
you don't. What's the big deal?

589
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:22,901
It's a big deal for a
boy born in a Sikh family.

590
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:27,073
When a Sikh boy cuts his hair...

591
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,613
I used to get angry
when people would see...

592
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,615
...not me but what was on my head.

593
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,114
I was 12 years old when a few boys...

594
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:38,845
...were playing hockey in my lane.

595
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,858
They allowed me to play on the
condition that I am the goalie.

596
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:44,687
I started playing.

597
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,355
After some time the game was about...

598
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:47,898
...who drops the turban from my head.

599
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:54,565
I broke my nose.

600
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,106
Both my eyes turned black.

601
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,409
That's why you cut your hair?

602
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:00,938
You may say so.

603
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:05,774
What is this?

604
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,410
I have made this forthe captain.
It's special.

605
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:12,185
Wow! My mouth is watering.

606
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,456
You also have it.
You begin.

607
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,926
Okay. Fine.

608
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:20,859
No.

609
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,029
What happened?

610
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,936
I am dead. It's so spicy.
Are you fine? What happened?

611
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,737
Drink water. Mr. Patel. Mr. Patel.

612
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:35,771
Peppermint.

613
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:38,809
Is that so?

614
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,046
After burning my mouth you
are trying to entice me.

615
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,452
I am not flirting with you.

616
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,718
Are you fine?

617
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,089
Because you can file a
human rights case on Patel.

618
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:53,691
Thanks for giving me a
taste of Indian food.

619
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,701
Okay. Will Chinese
be okay next time?

620
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,498
Goodnight.

621
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,206
Somebody give me a massage.

622
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,937
My legs are broken.
- All of you don't have energy.

623
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,684
Chess players are more energetic.

624
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,117
Friends, he is kidding.

625
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,552
Because you don't have to
move in a chess tournament.

626
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:18,714
Am I right?

627
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,119
All of you insult me there.

628
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:23,683
Henceforth we will stay
on the ice for longer.

629
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,229
I want more
commitment from all of you.

630
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,756
Coach, we want a nice uniform.

631
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,466
Right?
Yes. True.

632
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,901
It feels as if a team
of beggars is playing.

633
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,063
Right?
Yes.

634
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,666
I like it. Look, red color.
Its designer.

635
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:39,573
All of you are right.

636
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,202
We look like beggars.

637
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,940
If somebody has money and
pity for us hapless people...

638
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:47,246
This is the time.

639
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:58,120
What do you say? Is
Speedy Singhs okay?

640
00:29:58,596 --> 00:29:59,961
It's great.

641
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:03,493
What do you think?

642
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:06,059
Should I invest money in
this Punjabi hockey team?

643
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:09,669
We will have to see Mr. Singh's ROI.

644
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,437
Return on investment.

645
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,976
Look, we can't take a major decision
without a business proposal.

646
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,141
So...

647
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:20,509
You are intelligent.

648
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,278
Thank you.

649
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:27,113
Uncle, what profit in
supporting your community?

650
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,751
Deva's team's name
will be Speedy Singhs.

651
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,395
It's great, isn't it?
Speedy Singhs.

652
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,757
It's a good name.

653
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:40,435
Fine. Let's have a
fundraising party.

654
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,303
I will invest the remaining money.

655
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,212
Deva came imploring for his team.

656
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:57,015
I understood it will be really
beneficial to invest money in...

657
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,249
...lndian community's ice hockey.

658
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,224
Hello. Hello.
I told him.

659
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:04,125
Let's invest in a
profitable venture.

660
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,355
See this.

661
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,228
Today, it's so lively because of me.

662
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,527
Please. Please. Enjoy yourself.

663
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,634
He has come to ask for more money.

664
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,603
Eat something.

665
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:16,139
He spoke nonsense.
You must be hungry.

666
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,198
Look, we don't get along well.

667
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,244
But soon we will be family.

668
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,575
When Reena marries you.

669
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:23,705
What do you mean?

670
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,508
She is crazy. I don't
know what she sees in you.

671
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,277
Right. Good one.

672
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:32,116
If that is the case, we
will behave like nephews.

673
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,625
Just bear in mind that I am
your boss's would-be son-in-law.

674
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:37,587
What do you mean?

675
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,630
You will have to work
under your brother-in-law.

676
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,622
Punjabi boy crazy for hockey.

677
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,493
Good luck, bro.

678
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,161
Well said.

679
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,064
Be real.

680
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:51,402
Coach Winters.

681
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:54,175
I have met you before, haven't I?
Hi.

682
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,405
It is betterthat you
concentrate on your game.

683
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,277
Drunkard, be careful.
Don't fall down.

684
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:59,475
Reena, your mother is sloshed.
Take care of her.

685
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,677
Why has everybody come here?
Mom.

686
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,118
Uncle Sammy.

687
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,552
How are you?

688
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:05,782
He is...

689
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,282
Inderjit.
Inderjit.

690
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,523
How are you?
- It's fun.

691
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,687
Uncle Sammy, he is
our coach Dan Winters.

692
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:13,288
How are you?

693
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:16,299
Pleased to meet you.
She is my sister Melissa.

694
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:17,459
Good to see you.

695
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:19,730
Mr. Singh is the owner
of Speedy Singh transport.

696
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:21,465
As well as the
sponsor of this event.

697
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:23,331
His lovely wife.

698
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,171
Hi.
Hello.

699
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:28,168
His beautiful daughter Reena.

700
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:29,804
Hi. How are you?
Fine.

701
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:32,407
I think my face is up.

702
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:36,483
By the way, pleased to
meet you, Mr. Winters.

703
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:37,646
I am fortunate.

704
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,883
Your support is very
important for ourteam.

705
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:42,623
And your nephew is
ourteam's best player.

706
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,587
Rajveer.

707
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,656
He is also in the team?

708
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,790
Yes.
No. No.

709
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,427
He is not in the team.

710
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,302
He is not in the playing team.

711
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:56,363
He is like a supporterforthe team.

712
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,671
He is the team's supporter.
That is what he meant.

713
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,301
He doesn't even know how to play.

714
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,771
Don't worry. By the way,
I am the goal keeper.

715
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:05,611
I have heard you have written
my name on all your equipments.

716
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:07,615
So you know?
Yes.

717
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:08,811
I see. Yes.

718
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:24,560
Son.

719
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:26,529
Yes, mother.

720
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:28,636
I know what you are thinking.

721
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,674
Is that so?
Yes.

722
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:34,309
I just want to say
that we are proud of you.

723
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:37,246
I always knew you are
not like yourfriends.

724
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,613
They are wasting their
lives for a stupid game.

725
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,810
I told you, Lavleen.

726
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:43,877
Someday he will
realize his responsibilities.

727
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:47,189
Papa, listen.
I am proud of you.

728
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:48,820
Monica.

729
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:49,951
One moment, son.

730
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,692
Let me enjoy the dance.

731
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,573
Melissa.

732
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:12,977
Do I know you?

733
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:14,712
Shall we have a dance?

734
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:17,818
You will get to know me too.

735
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:19,687
I am a very bad dancer.

736
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,884
Come. I will teach you.

737
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,456
You will raise a lot of funds.

738
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:31,627
You are happy, aren't you?

739
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,363
It will be good help forthe team.

740
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:34,798
Yes. That's true.

741
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:37,606
When are you meeting me again?

742
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,971
Why? You can't see
me clearly this time?

743
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:43,211
I mean, just the two of us.

744
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:45,982
We are not alone here.

745
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,513
That is yourfamily?

746
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,616
Yes.

747
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:54,418
How do you know?

748
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:59,987
Because they are the
only people staring at me.

749
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:04,301
Did you see my eyes? - That's
how I know they are yourfamily.

750
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:12,773
How does he know that foreigner?

751
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,571
Foreigner? - The same
foreignerwith whom he was dancing...

752
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:17,477
...as if he is
dancing in his marriage.

753
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:18,879
That foreigner.

754
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,212
Do you know?

755
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:23,181
He is punishing me because I
didn't let him play ice hockey.

756
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,349
It means, if he can't
play foreigners' game...

757
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:26,549
...he will get a foreigner girl.

758
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,387
They were not doing anything wrong.

759
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,949
They were only dancing.

760
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:32,719
We also danced only once.
We had two kids.

761
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,923
Not just that.

762
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,967
Patel told me he had come to his
restaurant with a foreigner girl.

763
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:38,566
She ate like a pig.

764
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,497
You are talking nonsense.

765
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:42,471
Yes. When he will marry
that foreignerwitch...

766
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,667
...you will know what is nonsense.

767
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,910
Stupid tie.

768
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,340
I hate ties.

769
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,773
What else do I hate?

770
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:56,946
Apple pie. What is it called?
Peanut butter.

771
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,548
Untie it.

772
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,421
Come on, boys.

773
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,362
How did they come here?

774
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:12,595
It's our practice time.

775
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,905
Maybe I did double booking.

776
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:17,974
Coach, you did that deliberately.

777
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,634
Sooner or later, you have
to play with Hammerheads.

778
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,768
Why not today?

779
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,437
Let's see how good you are.

780
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,946
Don't you trust my capability?

781
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,381
If you have so much confidence,
go and prove yourself.

782
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:28,042
Go.

783
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,479
Fine. Today, we will see them.

784
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,256
Terminator.

785
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:39,757
Have some pity on us.

786
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,429
Fine, scoundrel.

787
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:45,761
Take this.

788
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,069
You...

789
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,991
Go, kiddo. Go and drink milk.

790
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:12,854
Take this.

791
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:14,559
Deva. Deva, get up.

792
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,628
Deva, are you fine? Come on. Get up.

793
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:18,427
Deva. Deva.

794
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,970
Rogue.
Enough fortoday.

795
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:23,501
It was nice to play with you.

796
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,666
Bring him here.

797
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:26,509
Are you fine?
Yes. I am Fine.

798
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:30,108
Deva, sorry. You got hurt.

799
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:31,645
If you had not got hurt,
they would have been...

800
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:32,842
...still hammering us.

801
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:34,744
I don't know why they are jealous.

802
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,083
Fine. We were overconfident.

803
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,549
Okay. Me.

804
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:44,426
Our plight will be bad.
We need help.

805
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,486
We need practice.
One moment, friends.

806
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,525
I will tell you what the problem is.

807
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:52,359
We need some strong boys.

808
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:56,906
Oh, my God.

809
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,373
This is 'Kabaddi'.

810
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,909
India's great sport.

811
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,939
This looks like sumo and wrestling.

812
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:07,477
Actually, it's very simple.

813
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:08,950
But difficult to explain.

814
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,119
We are not here forthat.

815
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:15,457
Nikku Singh.

816
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,388
We would play hockey
when we were kids.

817
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:21,762
He is very beefy.

818
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,931
That's what we need.

819
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:49,718
Uncle.

820
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:50,920
Yes, Sonu.

821
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,657
Sir said to take your
approval forthe road schedule.

822
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,726
It will be good to send
Rajveer on his first trip.

823
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:00,836
Good. I will do my best.

824
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,031
Thank you.
No problem.

825
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,018
Hi, papa. Sorry. I am late.

826
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,323
You fool. At times come on time.

827
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:25,555
Take this.

828
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:27,358
Our hero has come.

829
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,490
Liked it at the Gurdwara?

830
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,932
Good. Very good.

831
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,031
The food's aroma is great.

832
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,438
Thank you.
Mother, teach Reena cooking.

833
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,772
It will be good if she
learns it before marriage.

834
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:41,902
I am noticing everything, Sonu.

835
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,844
You never leave a
chance to taunt me.

836
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,576
Did you give them the good news?
Good news?

837
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:50,086
Well, Akshay Kumar is
coming to town for shooting.

838
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:51,814
Really?

839
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,583
I am going to take his interview.

840
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:56,390
What are you saying?

841
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,451
He is a nice man. Family type man.

842
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,029
Good, Sonu.

843
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,896
I hope this hero
doesn't take Reena away.

844
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,162
How? On a flying saucer?

845
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:06,967
Will you have beer?
Yes. Why not?

846
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:08,902
No, uncle. Sonu won't drink.

847
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:11,032
He swings like a
child aftertwo pegs.

848
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:12,871
Yes. Mentally, he is a kid.

849
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:15,138
Raj, sirwants you to go
on yourfirst road trip.

850
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,838
Tonight.

851
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,109
You are going to New York. To
deliver an important package.

852
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,786
Is that so? You are also
coming along with the package?

853
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,420
You are right. I am
an important package.

854
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:29,482
But it's not your cup
of tea to send me back.

855
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,494
Don't worry. It's nothing illegal.
Nothing will happen to you.

856
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,462
Rajveer, you got to
handle some responsibility.

857
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:39,533
Underthis pretext you will
practice driving a truck too.

858
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,495
Sonu, please stop pulling Raj's leg.

859
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,135
Uncle Sammy.

860
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,172
Yes, son. Tell me. I wanted
to talk to you for a moment.

861
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:49,606
Yes. Tell me. - I think there
is some problem in the schedule.

862
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,477
Papa was saying I have
to go to New York tonight.

863
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:54,177
But I... - I had told the
office not to put you on schedule.

864
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:56,181
If you go to New York,
how will you play hockey?

865
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:00,012
How long have you known, uncle?

866
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,923
Since the time you came to
me with yourfriend Deva.

867
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:06,424
You should have told yourfamily.
You know father.

868
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:07,657
How do I tell him?

869
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:10,222
He wants to see you successful,
Rajveer.

870
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,992
But he doesn't understand me.

871
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:17,004
Nephew, don't worry.
Go and show them.

872
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,435
Thanks, uncle. The
first goal will be for you.

873
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,138
Score a goal for your dad.

874
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,738
He loves you.
Uncle is the best.

875
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,879
Hi, mom. Today my dinner
is out. Okay? - Yes. I know.

876
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,614
That's why I have packed
potato stuffed flatbread.

877
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:33,623
Amazing, mom!
Tonight is very special for you.

878
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:37,058
You will like New York a lot.
Big Apple. - Yes.

879
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:40,562
This is yourfirst road trip.

880
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,056
Take this, son. - I still
remember my first road trip.

881
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:46,534
Take care of the truck.
It's a great truck.

882
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:49,071
Okay. Sure. I should be leaving now.

883
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:51,937
Come. Give me a hug.
He is very happy for you today.

884
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,777
May Lord be your savior! - Okay.
I will leave now. Thanks. - Bye.

885
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,778
I am very happy today.

886
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:02,075
Rajveer, you look great.
Fantastic. - Come on.

887
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:03,642
Alright, boys.
- That's it. Enough.

888
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:05,080
Enough.

889
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:09,051
It has started. And
all of you are ready.

890
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:11,753
Put your blood and sweat.

891
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,827
Coach, just give us a second.

892
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:18,525
Okay. - See you at the ice.
Fine. - Okay, coach.

893
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:21,070
Come on. Let us have a group huddle.

894
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:23,265
Come on. Come on.
Raj. - What?

895
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:25,266
Let's pray.

896
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,906
Okay. You need me?

897
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:33,716
Blessed is the person who says...

898
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:34,876
God is truth.

899
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:38,683
I welcome all of you to
the first Hyundai cup match.

900
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:41,919
Today, Speedy Singhs are
competing with Caliber.

901
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,892
Show them, Sardars.

902
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,286
Very good.

903
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:50,833
That playerwearing a helmet...

904
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,261
...isn't he Rajveer?

905
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,670
You recognized him now, you fool.

906
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,704
Lavleen, do you
remember God's photo?

907
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:00,667
I used to always keep it with me.

908
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,644
God has been so kind to us.

909
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:04,710
I am thinking of giving
this photo to Rajveer...

910
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:05,942
...before he leaves for New York.

911
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:08,314
Yes. Go and give him.
He must not have left.

912
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:11,146
Yes. I will be able to sleep
peacefully if God is with him.

913
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:13,985
Yes. Go and give him.
Give him my love.

914
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,889
Tell him to drive carefully.

915
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,086
I will tell him.

916
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:19,356
Pass it. Pass it.

917
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,133
Cut in. Come on.

918
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:27,998
Move it, man. Move it.

919
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,204
Go. Go.

920
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:37,909
And Rajveerfrom Speedy
Singhs has made a goal.

921
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:56,230
Rajveer, take God's
photo to New York with you.

922
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,827
The first match is between
Speedy Singhs and Caliber.

923
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:02,167
Where is Rajveer?
He has not come.

924
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,968
There are a lot of expectations.

925
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:07,374
Dan Winters is quite
excited about his team.

926
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:11,206
Let's see whetherthe team
lives up to the expectations.

927
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:17,820
It's a foul.

928
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,590
Very good.

929
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,655
Well done. Well done.
Great passing by them.

930
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:31,223
And a splendid goal for
Caliber in the second period.

931
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:33,197
Okay.

932
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:34,764
Come on. Buck up.

933
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:48,381
With this foul Speedy Singhs
get a penalty of two minutes.

934
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:00,430
Caliber scores another goal.

935
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:01,589
In the third period.

936
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:04,691
With this Caliber is
ahead of Singhs, two to one.

937
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:09,728
Fine. I wanted to win.
But we played well.

938
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,399
We showed that we are there.

939
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:12,635
We showed many things.

940
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:15,569
Do you want to say something?

941
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,438
Yes.

942
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:18,879
Why to beat in the game?

943
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:23,350
He saved our honor and
showed that we know how to play.

944
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,546
Honor?

945
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,753
Honor is earned only by winning.

946
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:30,254
I think you are forgetting you
are the captain and I am the coach.

947
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:31,760
This is coach's game plan?

948
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:33,262
A stupid penalty.

949
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,854
Not at all. I have an easier plan.

950
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:36,593
You will do whatever I say.

951
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,265
This is fine.

952
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:42,632
You played well.
Thanks.

953
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:49,738
Hey.

954
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,615
I think you are spending a
lot of time with my brother.

955
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:54,878
Yes. You are right.

956
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:57,352
There is same tension on yourface.

957
00:45:57,621 --> 00:45:59,612
Cheer up, captain. You played well.

958
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,983
Thanks. You should be in the class.

959
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:03,989
Yes. But as the team's lawyer,
it's important to watch...

960
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:05,957
...Speedy Singhs' matches.

961
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:09,760
Okay, lawyer. I want to
file a case on my coach.

962
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:12,597
You are upset because of the
penalty. - How do you know?

963
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:14,432
I understand ice hockey quite well.

964
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:16,268
I would be with Dan
in all his matches.

965
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,534
Was he good?

966
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,032
He was second rated in NHL.

967
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,609
Good skater. Good stick handler.

968
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:25,239
But a bad team player.

969
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:28,482
His ego and anger ruined his career.

970
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:38,361
You keep his rookie card with you.

971
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:42,660
He was always a rookie.
So I am very emotional.

972
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:45,062
You don't like hockey players.

973
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:50,704
I didn't say I don't
like hockey players.

974
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:52,332
I don't date them.

975
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:55,536
Until now.

976
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:06,853
Rajveer.

977
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:08,983
You fool.
Uncle.

978
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:11,527
How are you, son?
Soni. - Hi.

979
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,722
Don't worry. He knows everything.

980
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:17,460
Aftertoday's game you have
become famous all over Canada.

981
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:18,660
Famous.
Look.

982
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:20,293
Really? Even after losing?

983
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,361
Whether you win or lose,
what difference does it make?

984
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,407
We didn't have a team before.

985
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:27,910
Listen. Tomorrow we will
tell yourfather. Don't worry.

986
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:30,007
Fine, uncle.

987
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,707
But I will stay in
your house tonight.

988
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:32,874
I am in New York. Remember?

989
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,042
Yes. Surely.

990
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,812
Today, stay with Sonu.
Oh, no.

991
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:38,115
Take his autograph.

992
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:42,953
Listen. If you are lucky,
I will show you my tattoos.

993
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,052
If you don't wet your bed, I
will also show you many things.

994
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:48,654
What did you say? Okay. Okay.

995
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:50,063
""Move back, beautiful damsel.""

996
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:53,466
""Ourtrain is heading towards you.""

997
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:01,008
99

998
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,744
100
- It won't make a difference.

999
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:10,015
Who is Melissa?
Leave it.

1000
00:48:10,822 --> 00:48:11,880
Give it here.

1001
00:48:11,957 --> 00:48:15,324
What do you care about Melissa?
Relax.

1002
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:17,258
You can't score a
goal in the match...

1003
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:18,956
...I doubt you will score in love.

1004
00:48:19,297 --> 00:48:21,993
And you can't tell your
parents about your game...

1005
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:24,365
...what else can you tell them?
Are you done?

1006
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:26,096
Almost.

1007
00:48:26,705 --> 00:48:28,866
Go to sleep, my head's paining.

1008
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:32,034
Headache. That's your
family ailment, just like Reena.

1009
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:34,010
Someday you will make a good wife.

1010
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:38,841
Sexy bed. Where will you sleep?

1011
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:41,215
I will sleep right here.
You can sleep with me here.

1012
00:48:41,286 --> 00:48:44,119
But I get really
naughty in the morning.

1013
00:48:44,189 --> 00:48:46,123
Naughty. Quite naughty.

1014
00:48:46,191 --> 00:48:47,249
Come on.

1015
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:49,452
Seems like you don't like your nose.

1016
00:48:49,528 --> 00:48:51,428
Really? What a bad joke.

1017
00:48:51,496 --> 00:48:53,293
Elephant to the ant: ""Look,
my mom's here"".

1018
00:48:53,365 --> 00:48:54,457
Ant: ""Quick, hide behind me.""

1019
00:48:55,834 --> 00:48:56,926
Be quiet.

1020
00:48:57,269 --> 00:48:58,361
I will sleep on the floor.

1021
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:00,097
Do you want this pillow? - Yes.

1022
00:49:00,405 --> 00:49:01,497
Fine, take it.

1023
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,037
You know Reena's doggy Foo Foo.

1024
00:49:03,508 --> 00:49:04,839
Prefers this pillow as well.

1025
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:06,002
Oh no.

1026
00:49:07,245 --> 00:49:09,543
And don't use that blanket as well.
Why?

1027
00:49:09,781 --> 00:49:11,840
Because that is Reena
and my personal blanket.

1028
00:49:17,255 --> 00:49:18,950
I feel pity for you.

1029
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,852
Here.

1030
00:49:22,928 --> 00:49:24,225
You can use this as a blanket.

1031
00:49:29,568 --> 00:49:32,059
I nevertaught him to lie.

1032
00:49:32,137 --> 00:49:35,436
And Sammy. Even he hid this from me.

1033
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:39,977
You asked your son
something that he loves the most.

1034
00:49:40,045 --> 00:49:42,275
So now it's my
fault that he is lying.

1035
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:44,879
Even George Bush
doesn't lie this much.

1036
00:49:45,851 --> 00:49:49,343
Can you stop loving me
if someone asks you to?

1037
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:54,992
I feel really angry when
you use these female points.

1038
00:49:55,927 --> 00:49:59,294
Which other points do
I have? - I don't know.

1039
00:50:03,435 --> 00:50:06,063
And if he's scared to
talk to talk to you...

1040
00:50:06,137 --> 00:50:07,502
...then you talk to him.

1041
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:10,369
But please, just talk to him.

1042
00:50:10,442 --> 00:50:11,534
Don't lecture him.

1043
01:05:07,638 --> 01:05:08,696
Very good.

1044
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,503
I am very happy with what you did.

1045
01:05:11,742 --> 01:05:12,902
The singing, dancing. Drinking.

1046
01:05:13,811 --> 01:05:16,575
Fighting. All that was
left was getting locked up...

1047
01:05:16,647 --> 01:05:17,944
...but you took care of that as well.

1048
01:05:19,283 --> 01:05:22,946
But next time... keep my
sister away from all this.

1049
01:05:23,187 --> 01:05:24,484
Coach, I don't remember anything.

1050
01:05:24,555 --> 01:05:25,681
I don't know anything.

1051
01:05:29,326 --> 01:05:30,554
Get out of my locker room.

1052
01:05:31,896 --> 01:05:32,988
Come on.

1053
01:05:33,764 --> 01:05:35,959
I told you to invite
him to the party as well.

1054
01:05:39,537 --> 01:05:40,697
Coach.

1055
01:05:42,473 --> 01:05:43,565
I am sorry.

1056
01:05:44,408 --> 01:05:47,275
I take full responsibility of
whatever happened last night.

1057
01:05:47,511 --> 01:05:48,603
Good.

1058
01:05:49,013 --> 01:05:50,310
Nice to hearthat.

1059
01:05:51,482 --> 01:05:53,677
So everything's fine?
- Do you think everything's fine?

1060
01:05:57,788 --> 01:05:59,016
You aren't worthy of that.

1061
01:05:59,423 --> 01:06:01,550
You can't do that.
I just did.

1062
01:06:03,661 --> 01:06:05,720
Okay. Then I won't play.

1063
01:06:05,796 --> 01:06:07,696
We will win this game
and go to the finals.

1064
01:06:07,765 --> 01:06:10,233
We both know that it's
impossible without me.

1065
01:06:10,301 --> 01:06:13,031
Is that so?
Yes, It is.

1066
01:06:18,008 --> 01:06:20,533
Remember, once you
are out you are out.

1067
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:37,818
That's a stupid reason.

1068
01:06:38,262 --> 01:06:39,354
You can turn away from me...

1069
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:40,522
...but what will you say to yourself?

1070
01:06:40,598 --> 01:06:43,431
About what? About saving you?

1071
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,798
Saving me? You were
only saving your ego.

1072
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:48,839
Just say what you understand.
Fine.

1073
01:06:48,906 --> 01:06:50,032
Let's talk about Hockey?

1074
01:06:50,274 --> 01:06:51,400
Just because Dan took away...

1075
01:06:51,475 --> 01:06:52,567
...the captainship
from you, that's why?

1076
01:06:52,643 --> 01:06:54,406
I left the team because...

1077
01:06:54,478 --> 01:06:55,877
...I don't want to hearfrom
someone who cleans the ice.

1078
01:06:55,946 --> 01:06:57,846
Let me tell you something, big man.

1079
01:06:58,282 --> 01:07:00,375
Come right here, behind the bench.

1080
01:07:00,851 --> 01:07:03,581
And remember, I don't like quitters.

1081
01:07:41,225 --> 01:07:43,250
Look, that's all there was left.

1082
01:07:44,428 --> 01:07:46,726
Hey, coach, sorry...
I am No longer your coach.

1083
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:53,932
I am sorry.

1084
01:07:54,004 --> 01:07:55,369
Look, I made a mistake.

1085
01:07:55,439 --> 01:07:57,066
I should play forthe team.

1086
01:07:57,708 --> 01:07:59,938
Wait. You think the
Speedy Singhs will lose...

1087
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:01,170
...if you don't play?

1088
01:08:02,446 --> 01:08:03,538
Well, you are wrong.

1089
01:08:03,981 --> 01:08:05,073
They won.

1090
01:08:05,382 --> 01:08:07,282
We won?
Yes.

1091
01:08:07,351 --> 01:08:08,477
4-3, in the overtime.

1092
01:08:08,552 --> 01:08:10,713
We made it to the finals,
and without you.

1093
01:08:11,188 --> 01:08:12,314
That's great.

1094
01:08:12,389 --> 01:08:13,481
I don't believe it.
Yes.

1095
01:08:13,557 --> 01:08:15,252
Afterthe game the Hammerheads...

1096
01:08:15,326 --> 01:08:16,588
...lodged a complaint that Singhs...

1097
01:08:17,161 --> 01:08:19,391
...cannot play without a helmet.

1098
01:08:19,463 --> 01:08:20,691
Why didn't they do
anything until now?

1099
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:23,756
I feel they never imagined
that you will make it this far.

1100
01:08:25,102 --> 01:08:27,536
They will nevertake off
theirturban to wearthe helmets.

1101
01:08:27,972 --> 01:08:29,462
So it's no use now.

1102
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:50,323
Daddy, I was scared.

1103
01:08:50,394 --> 01:08:51,520
Daddy, look at him.

1104
01:08:51,595 --> 01:08:54,996
I am scared he might beat us too.

1105
01:08:55,065 --> 01:08:57,124
No, son, no one will hurt you.

1106
01:08:57,201 --> 01:08:58,361
Always remember.

1107
01:08:58,435 --> 01:09:00,027
When the Lord's your benefactor...

1108
01:09:00,104 --> 01:09:01,662
...no one can hurt you.

1109
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:05,675
Our Guru has blessed
us with this turban.

1110
01:09:05,743 --> 01:09:07,108
He gave us his blessings.

1111
01:09:07,177 --> 01:09:09,577
Rememberthat? Understand. Look.

1112
01:09:10,047 --> 01:09:11,344
This is the Golden Temple.

1113
01:09:11,415 --> 01:09:13,144
I will take you there.
Akshay Kumar.

1114
01:09:13,217 --> 01:09:16,243
Next year I will take
you and your motherthere.

1115
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:19,816
But how can ourturban protect us?

1116
01:09:20,391 --> 01:09:22,450
I will tell you how.

1117
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:26,687
Look, this turban is our crown.

1118
01:09:27,297 --> 01:09:28,696
It's our inner strength.

1119
01:09:29,233 --> 01:09:30,791
History stands witness, son.

1120
01:09:31,035 --> 01:09:35,836
Whoever cast an evil on us,
always faced destruction.

1121
01:09:36,073 --> 01:09:38,405
The Sikhs have won so many wars...

1122
01:09:38,475 --> 01:09:40,409
...due to the grace of this turban.

1123
01:09:40,477 --> 01:09:44,277
And you know...
Daddy, who is he?

1124
01:09:45,582 --> 01:09:48,073
He is our great
emperor Kng Ranjit Singh.

1125
01:09:48,352 --> 01:09:49,614
He showed the world that...

1126
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:52,120
...our Guru has turned us
into fearless warriors.

1127
01:09:53,257 --> 01:09:56,385
Glory to Lord Guru!
- Glory to Lord Guru!

1128
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:58,121
My brave son.

1129
01:09:58,195 --> 01:09:59,321
My brave son.

1130
01:09:59,797 --> 01:10:01,196
Cut it.

1131
01:10:01,265 --> 01:10:02,493
That's a cut.

1132
01:10:04,134 --> 01:10:05,226
Here.

1133
01:10:06,403 --> 01:10:07,495
Great shot.

1134
01:10:07,571 --> 01:10:09,835
Yes.
Can I Have an autograph? - Sure.

1135
01:10:14,378 --> 01:10:15,470
Thank you.

1136
01:10:15,546 --> 01:10:17,104
Name?
Darvesh.

1137
01:10:17,181 --> 01:10:19,741
Darvesh.
- It's for my father.

1138
01:10:21,518 --> 01:10:23,577
Father. Interesting.

1139
01:10:23,854 --> 01:10:25,412
He is Rajveer Singh.

1140
01:10:26,123 --> 01:10:27,556
Ice-hockey captain.

1141
01:10:27,624 --> 01:10:29,592
I mentioned about him earlier.
Oh Yes.

1142
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:31,155
Nice meeting you.

1143
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:32,320
Speedy Singh.
Yes.

1144
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:34,856
It's an honour meeting you.
I wish that was True.

1145
01:10:35,099 --> 01:10:36,430
I am working on it.

1146
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:39,567
Well, I wish I could come and
watch yourfinals. - Me too.

1147
01:10:41,171 --> 01:10:42,832
Anyway, good luck.

1148
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:44,669
And if you win the party is on me.

1149
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:46,606
Thank you.
Goodbye.

1150
01:10:47,311 --> 01:10:48,403
See you.

1151
01:10:58,722 --> 01:11:00,417
Maybe this will work.

1152
01:11:00,791 --> 01:11:02,588
But it will cost dearly.

1153
01:11:02,659 --> 01:11:04,820
Do you think you can
get this done in a week?

1154
01:11:05,829 --> 01:11:07,160
Yes, of course.

1155
01:11:07,631 --> 01:11:09,258
Where did you get this money from?

1156
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:12,326
Trucking.
By driving trucks.

1157
01:11:15,472 --> 01:11:17,667
What's the league's
problem with us wearing a turban?

1158
01:11:17,741 --> 01:11:19,333
Coach.
What are they saying

1159
01:11:21,411 --> 01:11:22,537
Okay, we are all here.

1160
01:11:22,846 --> 01:11:23,938
Tell us what you wanted to.

1161
01:11:24,181 --> 01:11:26,911
I think it will be
better if Raj tells you.

1162
01:11:28,619 --> 01:11:29,677
What are you doing here?

1163
01:11:29,753 --> 01:11:31,186
This is ourteam meeting.

1164
01:11:31,622 --> 01:11:32,714
First thing.

1165
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,916
Friends, please forgive me.

1166
01:11:37,694 --> 01:11:39,821
You all deserve this championship.

1167
01:11:39,897 --> 01:11:41,387
Much more than that.

1168
01:11:41,698 --> 01:11:42,892
That's not possible, friend.

1169
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:44,524
We won't take off the turban.

1170
01:11:45,435 --> 01:11:46,595
We have hit dead end.

1171
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:48,865
End of story.
I heard.

1172
01:11:49,506 --> 01:11:52,805
But I learnt a lot seeing
the courage of this team.

1173
01:11:54,178 --> 01:11:57,670
Coach, I don't deserve to
be the captain of this team.

1174
01:11:57,948 --> 01:11:59,245
Is that all you want to say?

1175
01:12:00,651 --> 01:12:01,743
No.

1176
01:12:05,556 --> 01:12:06,648
Look.

1177
01:12:06,957 --> 01:12:09,892
What is this?
What is this?

1178
01:12:11,628 --> 01:12:14,461
Centuries ago, the
Gurus wore this in wars.

1179
01:12:14,898 --> 01:12:18,390
Now you all will protect
our respect and honour.

1180
01:12:18,802 --> 01:12:21,396
But this time, the
warwill be on the ice.

1181
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:24,532
Listen, listen, listen.
Just a minute. Just a minute.

1182
01:12:24,608 --> 01:12:26,633
The officials won't
allow us to wearthis.

1183
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:28,610
By the way, your
sister has informed them...

1184
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:30,544
...how they can be worn.

1185
01:12:30,614 --> 01:12:32,946
Friends, with your permission.

1186
01:12:33,383 --> 01:12:36,614
According to Civil Court
Part one section eight...

1187
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:40,550
...my clients are being
stopped from following theirfaith.

1188
01:12:41,491 --> 01:12:44,255
That's a human rights violation.

1189
01:12:45,395 --> 01:12:46,555
That's right.

1190
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:47,756
Good point.

1191
01:12:48,532 --> 01:12:50,329
I don't know whether
this will work or not.

1192
01:12:50,567 --> 01:12:52,034
It already has.

1193
01:12:53,704 --> 01:12:56,867
And Raj has paid for
this from his savings.

1194
01:12:57,708 --> 01:13:00,677
And you can return it by
defeating Hammerheads.

1195
01:13:01,778 --> 01:13:02,870
Good luck.

1196
01:13:04,281 --> 01:13:05,475
Come on, coach.
Coach, please.

1197
01:13:05,549 --> 01:13:08,950
Friends. I told him if
he leaves he's gone.

1198
01:13:09,019 --> 01:13:10,384
And I am true to my words.

1199
01:13:12,823 --> 01:13:16,281
But I nevertold him that
I will nevertake him back.

1200
01:13:36,348 --> 01:13:40,079
""Wearwedding turban with
full moon studed on it""

1201
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,546
""Wearwedding turban with
full moon studed on it""

1202
01:13:44,623 --> 01:13:47,023
""Today is the occassion of
your life time""

1203
01:13:47,125 --> 01:13:51,892
""Let's celetrate today,
our brother is going to mary""

1204
01:13:52,164 --> 01:13:54,029
""Brother is going to get maried""

1205
01:13:54,132 --> 01:13:56,259
""Let's all of us celeberate""

1206
01:13:56,334 --> 01:13:58,063
""Brother is goint to get married""

1207
01:13:58,170 --> 01:14:01,003
""Let's all of us celeberate""

1208
01:14:03,775 --> 01:14:09,145
""Went on to toil for 12 years,
afterwhich he brought love""

1209
01:14:09,214 --> 01:14:14,049
""Went on to toil for 12 years,
afterwhich he brought love""

1210
01:14:14,119 --> 01:14:16,485
""The wedding crown only looks good""

1211
01:14:16,955 --> 01:14:20,914
""Wedding crown only looks good
where groom's friends dance""

1212
01:14:20,992 --> 01:14:26,430
""Wedding crown only looks good
where groom's friends dance""

1213
01:14:29,201 --> 01:14:32,398
Excuse me! Please excuse me!

1214
01:14:32,504 --> 01:14:33,596
What? What happened?

1215
01:14:33,738 --> 01:14:35,433
Rina refuses to come out of her room.

1216
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:36,632
But, why? - I don't know.

1217
01:14:36,741 --> 01:14:38,072
Oh, she is a devil!

1218
01:14:38,143 --> 01:14:39,906
She's is putting us down.
- Groom here already.

1219
01:14:39,978 --> 01:14:40,876
Go talk to him.

1220
01:14:44,049 --> 01:14:45,311
Go talk to your bride.

1221
01:14:45,483 --> 01:14:46,575
Why, what's wrong.

1222
01:14:47,018 --> 01:14:49,077
Just go, please.
In the dressing room.

1223
01:14:55,827 --> 01:14:56,919
Reena.

1224
01:14:59,798 --> 01:15:01,390
Reena, what are you doing?

1225
01:15:02,334 --> 01:15:03,426
What happened?

1226
01:15:03,502 --> 01:15:06,164
I don't know if I'll be
going ahead with this marriage.

1227
01:15:06,538 --> 01:15:08,130
You are telling me now.

1228
01:15:08,406 --> 01:15:12,433
I feel sometimes you
become so selfish.

1229
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:14,775
You just want everything to
be the way you want it to be.

1230
01:15:14,846 --> 01:15:15,972
Not everything.

1231
01:15:16,047 --> 01:15:18,811
You came to my party and got drunk...

1232
01:15:18,884 --> 01:15:20,283
...even though you knew
that you can't digest it.

1233
01:15:20,352 --> 01:15:22,786
That was a party. - You don't
everwatch me reading news either.

1234
01:15:22,854 --> 01:15:24,048
I watch you all the time.

1235
01:15:24,122 --> 01:15:25,350
What was I wearing on Thursday?

1236
01:15:25,924 --> 01:15:27,858
Purple. Green. Sea green.

1237
01:15:27,926 --> 01:15:30,895
No. Red silk blouse tucked
into a bellbottom jeans.

1238
01:15:30,962 --> 01:15:33,362
What difference does that make?
I mean I record news.

1239
01:15:33,832 --> 01:15:36,198
Do you actually think we
are right for each other?

1240
01:15:36,401 --> 01:15:40,098
Look Reena, I have never
felt like this about anyone.

1241
01:15:41,473 --> 01:15:45,170
Reena, I have nothing except you.

1242
01:15:47,012 --> 01:15:48,809
I will try not to
think about myself.

1243
01:15:50,982 --> 01:15:52,347
I am kind of rascally.

1244
01:15:52,417 --> 01:15:53,850
But I have no control overthat.

1245
01:15:57,355 --> 01:16:00,882
I know. I know only you
can make me a better man.

1246
01:16:02,093 --> 01:16:03,151
Only you.

1247
01:16:13,838 --> 01:16:14,896
Alright.

1248
01:16:19,878 --> 01:16:21,505
Thank God you came out.
Sorry.

1249
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:23,207
I have parked my
elephant in the no parking zone.

1250
01:16:24,282 --> 01:16:25,510
I might get a ticket forthat.

1251
01:16:28,887 --> 01:16:30,514
Teach him to at
least button his shirt.

1252
01:16:30,922 --> 01:16:32,014
Please calm down.

1253
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:34,524
They will come.
I am calm. - You are not.

1254
01:16:49,107 --> 01:16:50,199
I'm sorry, dad.

1255
01:16:52,110 --> 01:16:54,305
Come, my Punjabi son. Rajveer Singh.

1256
01:16:54,379 --> 01:16:56,574
Welcome. Come home now. Okay?

1257
01:16:59,851 --> 01:17:01,079
Come on. Come on.

1258
01:17:01,152 --> 01:17:03,620
God bless. - Come on. It's
time forthe nuptial rounds.

1259
01:17:05,056 --> 01:17:07,957
Come on. Come on. Please.

1260
01:17:08,026 --> 01:17:09,186
Coming.

1261
01:17:54,005 --> 01:17:57,031
Ladies and Gentlemen,
this day is no ordinary day.

1262
01:17:57,375 --> 01:18:00,003
And not because I'm getting
married to my beautiful wife.

1263
01:18:00,345 --> 01:18:02,905
But because our reception will
take place at a hockey match.

1264
01:18:03,915 --> 01:18:05,439
My brother Rajveer
will play in that.

1265
01:18:05,884 --> 01:18:07,351
And my wife will cover it.

1266
01:18:13,391 --> 01:18:14,483
Go Speedy Singhs.

1267
01:18:15,427 --> 01:18:17,895
Seek His blessings.
And return victorious.

1268
01:18:18,430 --> 01:18:24,096
Whoever utters His
name shall be happy.

1269
01:18:25,937 --> 01:18:27,461
This is crazy.

1270
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:32,503
These guys are spoiling the marriage
function for a hockey match.

1271
01:18:32,577 --> 01:18:33,942
This is foolishness.

1272
01:18:37,816 --> 01:18:38,908
Give me your hand.

1273
01:18:39,184 --> 01:18:40,549
And you're not going anywhere.

1274
01:18:43,154 --> 01:18:45,088
This is forthe championship,
father.

1275
01:18:46,458 --> 01:18:47,789
And I am playing.

1276
01:18:48,593 --> 01:18:50,390
I will really like it if you come.

1277
01:18:50,462 --> 01:18:51,554
No.

1278
01:18:53,064 --> 01:18:54,156
Go.

1279
01:18:54,833 --> 01:18:56,926
It's an auspicious day.
I will stay here.

1280
01:19:03,942 --> 01:19:05,466
Life is full of surprises, isn't it?

1281
01:19:07,112 --> 01:19:08,340
I don't like surprises.

1282
01:19:10,048 --> 01:19:11,447
Your son is special.

1283
01:19:12,283 --> 01:19:13,841
You must watch him play.

1284
01:19:14,586 --> 01:19:16,053
You might change your mind.

1285
01:19:25,597 --> 01:19:28,998
Great. Are they here forthe
hockey match or a wedding?

1286
01:19:29,067 --> 01:19:30,864
This must be the
biggest Punjabi contingent...

1287
01:19:30,935 --> 01:19:32,027
...everto watch a hockey match.

1288
01:19:32,103 --> 01:19:34,936
It's time forthe
finals of the Hyundai Cup.

1289
01:19:35,006 --> 01:19:38,339
Underdogs Speedy Singhs
Vs favorites Hammerheads.

1290
01:19:38,409 --> 01:19:42,038
Speedy Singhs performance has
won the hearts of the Canadians.

1291
01:19:42,113 --> 01:19:44,240
This is Reena Singh from SIN.

1292
01:19:44,315 --> 01:19:45,646
And I just got married.

1293
01:19:52,123 --> 01:19:53,852
All of you actually
look like warriors.

1294
01:19:56,327 --> 01:19:57,419
Thank you, Mr. Singh.

1295
01:20:03,201 --> 01:20:04,293
Thank you, coach.

1296
01:20:04,936 --> 01:20:05,994
Come on, Raj.

1297
01:20:06,437 --> 01:20:07,563
Come on, guys.

1298
01:20:18,349 --> 01:20:20,214
I could've never
done this without you.

1299
01:20:20,485 --> 01:20:21,952
Don't mention it.

1300
01:20:22,587 --> 01:20:25,283
Some things are better left unsaid.

1301
01:20:32,197 --> 01:20:33,289
Thank you.

1302
01:20:39,604 --> 01:20:41,003
Go Speedy Singhs.

1303
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:43,963
""Punjabis are bravehearts.""

1304
01:20:54,252 --> 01:20:55,913
Rock it! Go for it.

1305
01:20:58,556 --> 01:21:01,923
Speedy Singhs are wearing
the warrior Sikh helmets.

1306
01:21:01,993 --> 01:21:04,257
They look like
warriors ready for battle.

1307
01:21:10,635 --> 01:21:11,727
You saw those jokers?

1308
01:21:20,879 --> 01:21:23,439
""Punjabis are bravehearts.""

1309
01:21:23,948 --> 01:21:25,040
Absolutely, Absolutely.

1310
01:21:25,116 --> 01:21:28,449
Today we'll find out if
Rajveer lives up to the hype.

1311
01:21:28,853 --> 01:21:36,589
'O Canada, our
home and native land.'

1312
01:21:37,428 --> 01:21:45,335
'True patriot love in
all thy sons command.'

1313
01:21:45,570 --> 01:21:50,473
'With glowing hearts
we see thee rise.'

1314
01:21:50,541 --> 01:21:55,137
'The True North strong and free! '

1315
01:21:55,914 --> 01:22:04,219
'From far and wide, O Canada,
we stand on guard forthee.'

1316
01:22:05,156 --> 01:22:09,525
'God keep our land
glorious and free! '

1317
01:22:10,361 --> 01:22:14,320
Alright. Boys, it's time.

1318
01:22:16,968 --> 01:22:18,060
Team work.

1319
01:22:18,436 --> 01:22:19,664
One, two, three.

1320
01:22:19,904 --> 01:22:21,030
Singhs!

1321
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:26,172
Go, Tanveer.

1322
01:22:36,087 --> 01:22:37,611
That's a nice bucket on your head.

1323
01:22:39,924 --> 01:22:41,687
'Rajveer Singh has been
pushed away from the puck.'

1324
01:22:41,926 --> 01:22:43,553
'Hammer heads have put
in the Singhs zone.'

1325
01:22:44,162 --> 01:22:45,390
Come. Have a seat.

1326
01:22:50,001 --> 01:22:51,901
'They're taking a shot
from the corner point.'

1327
01:22:51,970 --> 01:22:54,632
'Lnderjit saves it.' 'But it
has rebounded and they score.'

1328
01:22:56,441 --> 01:22:58,068
This is just the beginning.

1329
01:22:58,343 --> 01:22:59,708
One minute into the game,
the Hammerheads...

1330
01:22:59,944 --> 01:23:01,172
...are leading by 1-0.

1331
01:23:04,115 --> 01:23:06,583
'There are more than 3 minutes
remaining in the first round.'

1332
01:23:06,651 --> 01:23:09,950
'And Hammerheads are
still leading by 1-0.'

1333
01:23:10,321 --> 01:23:12,346
Speedy Singhs have put
into the Hammerheads zone.

1334
01:23:12,423 --> 01:23:13,651
They've lost the Puck at the corner.

1335
01:23:13,725 --> 01:23:16,057
And Rajveer has been hit.

1336
01:23:16,694 --> 01:23:17,956
Oh my God!

1337
01:23:18,029 --> 01:23:19,087
What a hit!

1338
01:23:19,163 --> 01:23:21,495
Hey! Where is the goal?

1339
01:23:22,367 --> 01:23:23,959
Referee, are you blind?

1340
01:23:24,035 --> 01:23:25,161
He is blind.

1341
01:23:27,105 --> 01:23:29,266
O poor kid. Are you hurt?

1342
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:30,432
Get lost.

1343
01:23:35,079 --> 01:23:37,673
I'll smack the referee. Jerk.

1344
01:23:37,749 --> 01:23:39,307
'This is bad.'

1345
01:23:39,384 --> 01:23:41,284
'We need assistance to
take him back to the bench.'

1346
01:23:41,352 --> 01:23:44,185
'He is badly hurt.' 'I hope
they don't sit him on the bench.'

1347
01:23:44,255 --> 01:23:48,248
'They need his talent badly
against the mighty Hammerheads.'

1348
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:51,594
We're having lots of
troubles there.

1349
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:55,996
Leku, go and destroy them.

1350
01:23:56,067 --> 01:23:57,125
Got it?

1351
01:23:59,203 --> 01:24:00,329
How are you now?

1352
01:24:00,605 --> 01:24:01,697
Absolutely fine.

1353
01:24:02,306 --> 01:24:03,773
If I see anything wrong...

1354
01:24:04,008 --> 01:24:05,532
...I will come to get you.

1355
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:07,743
Only if you can catch me.

1356
01:24:11,549 --> 01:24:13,176
They are still leading by a goal.

1357
01:24:13,251 --> 01:24:14,650
The pace is picking up.

1358
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:16,311
There are just three
minutes remaining.

1359
01:24:17,055 --> 01:24:18,784
A hard hit on the boundary.

1360
01:24:19,724 --> 01:24:21,385
Speedy Singhs have
changed their line.

1361
01:24:23,194 --> 01:24:24,627
Rajveer Singh has
picked it up from the line.

1362
01:24:24,695 --> 01:24:26,128
Put it in the Hammerhead zone.

1363
01:24:26,197 --> 01:24:27,687
And has taken out the defender.

1364
01:24:27,765 --> 01:24:29,596
And he can score.

1365
01:24:29,667 --> 01:24:31,760
But he has passed it to Jassi Singh.

1366
01:24:32,003 --> 01:24:33,595
And a goal!

1367
01:24:33,671 --> 01:24:37,038
Goal. Outstanding.
Well done.

1368
01:24:37,108 --> 01:24:38,370
What a goal.

1369
01:24:38,443 --> 01:24:39,740
Good. Very good.

1370
01:24:42,847 --> 01:24:44,872
We are starting the third period.

1371
01:24:44,949 --> 01:24:46,041
Everyone is together.

1372
01:24:46,117 --> 01:24:48,984
Friends, the game has
become more interesting.

1373
01:24:50,321 --> 01:24:52,289
Singhs have put the puck
into the Hammerheads zone.

1374
01:24:52,356 --> 01:24:53,880
And they have lost it.

1375
01:24:54,258 --> 01:24:56,783
Churchnick has put back
it to the center line.

1376
01:24:56,861 --> 01:24:57,919
Rajveer has cut the pass.

1377
01:24:57,995 --> 01:25:01,021
And has put the puck overthe
blue line of the Hammerheads.

1378
01:25:01,099 --> 01:25:02,396
He has the puck now.

1379
01:25:02,467 --> 01:25:05,493
He is dodging and
dunking the opposition.

1380
01:25:05,570 --> 01:25:07,231
And he has scored.

1381
01:25:07,538 --> 01:25:10,336
A beautiful goal by Rajveer.

1382
01:25:14,512 --> 01:25:17,913
Speedy Singhs are leading by 2-1
forthe first time in the game.

1383
01:25:18,182 --> 01:25:20,514
The entire stadium has erupted.

1384
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:24,110
Hammerhead has control over it now.

1385
01:25:25,490 --> 01:25:26,957
There are is just one
minute remaining in the game.

1386
01:25:27,024 --> 01:25:29,390
And the Hammerheads
goal keeper is going out.

1387
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:31,951
And a new attacker is replacing him.

1388
01:25:32,597 --> 01:25:33,859
Careful.

1389
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:38,068
Picking it up from the corner.
Passing the puck.

1390
01:25:38,136 --> 01:25:39,569
Passing it again.

1391
01:25:39,637 --> 01:25:41,002
This is a difficult shot.

1392
01:25:41,072 --> 01:25:43,097
Oh! What a save by Jassi Singh!

1393
01:25:43,875 --> 01:25:45,001
Rajveer has it now.

1394
01:25:45,076 --> 01:25:48,637
He is off with it. He has
passed it to Deva Singh.

1395
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,313
He takes aim at the unguarded goal.

1396
01:25:50,381 --> 01:25:53,441
Amazing. This goal
could seal Singhs victory.

1397
01:25:53,518 --> 01:25:55,281
Yes. Yes.

1398
01:25:55,353 --> 01:25:57,651
Oh. But he has saved it.

1399
01:25:57,889 --> 01:25:59,447
To the goal. To the goal.

1400
01:25:59,524 --> 01:26:02,186
Libiyu has the puck now.
He passes it to Martin.

1401
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:04,160
The Singhs are already celebrating.

1402
01:26:04,228 --> 01:26:05,320
They must go back.

1403
01:26:05,396 --> 01:26:06,522
But they aren't able to.

1404
01:26:06,597 --> 01:26:09,157
Martin is unmarked.
And he has scored.

1405
01:26:09,233 --> 01:26:11,360
Oh. And time up.

1406
01:26:11,435 --> 01:26:12,527
And both the teams are even now.

1407
01:26:12,603 --> 01:26:13,661
We are into overtime now.

1408
01:26:13,905 --> 01:26:15,338
This is really disappointing.

1409
01:26:15,406 --> 01:26:16,634
Victory was within Singhs grasp.

1410
01:26:16,874 --> 01:26:18,102
Now the team that
scores first in extra time...

1411
01:26:18,176 --> 01:26:20,872
...will be the winner
of the Hyundai Cup.

1412
01:26:22,013 --> 01:26:23,173
Okay. Come on.

1413
01:26:23,481 --> 01:26:24,539
No worries.

1414
01:26:24,949 --> 01:26:26,007
Listen to me.

1415
01:26:26,083 --> 01:26:29,109
All I've known is that
winning is everything.

1416
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:31,581
And we can do this
right here right now.

1417
01:26:32,690 --> 01:26:37,059
But you guys. You guys can
do something more than this.

1418
01:26:38,896 --> 01:26:41,364
About which I had never
thought before meeting you guys.

1419
01:26:41,699 --> 01:26:45,032
Tonight, you can show
the entire country...

1420
01:26:45,369 --> 01:26:46,495
...that you belong here.

1421
01:26:47,939 --> 01:26:50,134
Yes. I know you look different.

1422
01:26:50,341 --> 01:26:53,333
But if you go there and
do what I know you can do.

1423
01:26:53,411 --> 01:26:56,209
It will be clear
that you are champions.

1424
01:26:57,281 --> 01:26:58,339
Not them.

1425
01:27:03,221 --> 01:27:04,347
Three for Singhs.

1426
01:27:05,556 --> 01:27:06,921
One, two, three.

1427
01:27:06,991 --> 01:27:08,219
Singhs, Singhs, Singhs.

1428
01:27:08,292 --> 01:27:09,657
Singhs, Singhs, Singhs.

1429
01:27:09,727 --> 01:27:11,422
Singhs, Singhs, Singhs...

1430
01:27:11,495 --> 01:27:13,053
The extra time will start now.

1431
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:15,428
Both the teams are super charged.

1432
01:27:15,499 --> 01:27:18,059
The team that scores
first will the champion...

1433
01:27:18,135 --> 01:27:21,127
...of this year's Hyundia Cup.

1434
01:27:21,205 --> 01:27:23,605
Singhs, Singhs, Singhs.

1435
01:27:23,674 --> 01:27:26,302
Singhs, Singhs, Singhs.

1436
01:27:26,377 --> 01:27:30,609
Singhs, Singhs, Singhs...

1437
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:38,316
Your dreams of winning
will be destroyed for good.

1438
01:27:38,556 --> 01:27:39,921
This is the day of reckoning.

1439
01:27:43,294 --> 01:27:44,989
And the game begins again.

1440
01:27:45,062 --> 01:27:46,654
Both teams have swapped sides.

1441
01:27:46,731 --> 01:27:49,962
Hammerheads entering the
Singhs zone with the puck.

1442
01:27:50,034 --> 01:27:51,558
Morton is moving ahead.

1443
01:27:51,636 --> 01:27:53,194
He has picked up the
puck from the corner.

1444
01:27:53,271 --> 01:27:55,171
Rajveer Singh's
fabulous intervention.

1445
01:27:55,239 --> 01:27:56,331
And the puck is out again.

1446
01:27:56,574 --> 01:27:57,939
Morton still has the puck.

1447
01:27:58,009 --> 01:27:59,567
He has passed it to Libiyu.

1448
01:27:59,644 --> 01:28:01,009
Morton gets the pass again.

1449
01:28:01,078 --> 01:28:02,545
Morton passes it to Basal.

1450
01:28:02,613 --> 01:28:03,739
Basal has the puck.

1451
01:28:03,814 --> 01:28:05,304
He has passed it to
Churchnick Churchnick I's attempt.

1452
01:28:05,549 --> 01:28:06,846
What a save by the goalie.

1453
01:28:06,917 --> 01:28:08,111
Basal has the puck again.

1454
01:28:08,185 --> 01:28:09,243
Another attempt.

1455
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:11,015
And he has saved it again. Amazing.

1456
01:28:11,088 --> 01:28:13,056
He has passed it to Rajveer Singh.

1457
01:28:13,124 --> 01:28:16,958
Rajveer slips it
through Morton and Churchnick

1458
01:28:17,028 --> 01:28:18,222
Amazing.

1459
01:28:18,296 --> 01:28:20,594
Fantastic dribbling there.

1460
01:28:20,665 --> 01:28:22,826
What is happening?
Rajveer Singh has broken away.

1461
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:25,562
Now it is between the
goalkeeper and Rajveer Singh.

1462
01:28:30,107 --> 01:28:31,734
'Have you ever seen me play? '

1463
01:28:31,809 --> 01:28:33,140
'And I don't want to see either.'

1464
01:28:33,811 --> 01:28:35,608
'You deserve this.'

1465
01:28:36,914 --> 01:28:39,678
'And remember. I
hate people who ditch.'

1466
01:28:45,790 --> 01:28:48,122
'Son, you'll make me proud one day.'

1467
01:28:54,231 --> 01:28:57,029
He is taking the puck
to the left. Now right.

1468
01:28:57,101 --> 01:29:00,628
Overthe
goalkeeper's head. And goal!

1469
01:29:01,339 --> 01:29:05,173
Rajveer Singh has won
it for Speedy Singhs.

1470
01:29:05,976 --> 01:29:08,706
Yes. Yes.

1471
01:29:09,914 --> 01:29:12,280

1472
01:29:12,350 --> 01:29:14,978
And Speedy Singhs are the champions.

1473
01:29:19,690 --> 01:29:22,682

Sorry, coach.

1484

Go meet your dad.

1485

I know this wasn't easy for us.

1486
01:30:38,335 --> 01:30:42,032
But today, you haven't made
just me proud, but all of us.

1487
01:30:43,174 --> 01:30:44,232

16
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,907

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,138
You will take time to understand me

27
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,215

28
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,463
All have doubt

29
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:00,304

30
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,279

36
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,004
who is pushing management?

37
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,038
Its too late

38
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,016

39
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,739

42
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:35,661

00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:42,374
its your firstjob but i believe
you will do it

44

you also know music

45
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:04,590
change your hobby into profession.
School also needs a music teacher

46
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,468
if i'm not sure about anything
then i dont do it

47
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,920

start work from today

48
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,061

50
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,541
and its become life style for me now

51
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,340
you are right

52
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,245
principal still not come

53
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,882
check my heartbeat

54
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,820
principal is coming

55
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,042
he is a new teacher

56
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:46,286
i joined this school 32 years ago

57
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:52,862
on that time there were about
30 to 35 schools

58
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,299
and we were on top

59
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,370
now there are 350 to 400 schools

60
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,709
still our school name is in history

61
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,082
i dont like people talking about past

62
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:31,293
as a sports teacher, the management give you
facilities... are you happy with them?

63
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:41,277
It needs some make over

64
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,994
its just a dream

65
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:13,040
when you joined this school?
What did you want?

66
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,361
I can do anything for students

67
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,968
if i send you foreign for studies then
you would do more better

68
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,669
you think this for me...
thats enough for me

69
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:47,078
i think this for me but this thinking
is a question for me

70
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,866
it was taking three times more fees
on that time

71
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,136
and i think its taking 10 times
more than us

72
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,834
its a very small school than ours

73
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:22,773
still all parents are willing to
get admission in that school

74
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:27,508
people are ready to give any amount
as a donation

75
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,854
i have heard they use digital black board

76
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:38,260
they use many high tech facilities that
we cant compete

77
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:47,497
we are still behind than many schools

78
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,111
management is making a plan

79
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:02,246
i will inform you through email

80
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,874
with whom?

81
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,780
Its not like that

82
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,672
if you scare than tell me

83
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,415

84
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,288

I think i have to work hard

90
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,497
i think school needs funds

91
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:35,043
will i get the salary?

92
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,517
Our principal thinks about school alot

93
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,748
thats why he is very stressed

94
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,124
he is also going to USA

95
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,034

96
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:14,217
we all thought...
i must be a very old age person

97
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:28,533
principal talked to you about music

98
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:33,332
yes he was saying...

99
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,986

101
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:17,646
without asking you i promised
students that tomorrow there will be a music class

102
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,477

I will tell them

103
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:55,244

00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,232

00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,888

1st time i'm feeling negative

145
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,714
in our school there are 40
students in one class

146
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,987
which is better than other schools

147

148
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,835

152
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,965
i have talked to all teachers

153
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,104

154
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,521

155
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,368

156
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:23,201
you are right.
School has become for good than before

157
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,107
answer of your email is negative

158
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,676
now what will we do?

159
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,178
Your teachers are also not with you

160
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,850
they clearly said no

161
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,118
i will talk to them

162
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,657

163
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:43,649
but one girls know what she should
give to rahul sir

164
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,612

165
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,867
Also give him football

166
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:48,567
leave the football

167
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,414
go and sit at your place

168
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,380
why you are not doing practice?

169
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:58,651

170
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:01,150
I'm distributing football to your
students

171
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:20,307
can you tell me who decide this that
who will play and who wont?

172
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:26,945
If they wont buy ball from school than
they cant play here

173
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,679

174
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:36,824

175
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,627
if you dont know the rules of game
then dont involve in it

176
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:49,903
you know the rules of game and i
know the rules of school

177
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,707
they are my best players

178
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,882
you go from here.
I will talk to principal

179
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,256
he will come back at 4 days

180
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,352
you will talk to him.
But i have a request

181
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:13,621

management

182
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:15,957

00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:50,194
Go and distribute these coupons

187
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:57,739
you deny this?

188
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,969
Whom you ask this?

189
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:04,246
What is the thing to ask in it?

190
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:11,445
You care about students health but
you dont care about school health

191
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,822
what is loss in it?

192
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:18,227
I tell you the logic

193
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,799
school can save Rs 6 per bottle

194
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,369
you can sell all 4 in market

195
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:39,082
we have to use atleast one container

196
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,981
its a legal matter. Dont involve in this.
Read this

197
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,591
i'm tired.
Dont ask me

198
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,231
tomorrow i want all the papers

199
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:24,217
play as loud as you can

200
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:28,194
play it

201
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,966
play it loud

202
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:41,545
what is going on here?

203
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,278
They are playing

204
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,091
who give them guitars?

205
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:00,527
Your all questions answer are in it

206
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,370
you dont like childrens?

207
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:22,317
I like them but you can only
see these childrens

208
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:26,089
but i can see those students too

209
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,250
can you see those students happy?

210
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:44,706
Have you ever played guitar?

211
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:53,742
You have to learn it.
These childrens cant hold guitar even

212
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:28,013
how can we calm down?

213
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,157
Its a management decision

214
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:47,637
you put this on each other

215
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:54,106
we dont know whether they are
running school or shop?

216
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:59,379
Principal is coming tomorrow.
We will talk to him

217
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,138
what are you doing?

218
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:06,740
Now you started thinking?

219
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:10,715
I told him to stand here

220
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,553
whats in your hand?

221
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:20,993
Water? If you give him water than
i wont give you water

222
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:51,889
i have come now

223
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:55,295
you are not going good

224
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:00,862
i dont care where you will bring us

225
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:04,698
but before going anywhere have
a look at this

226
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:13,441
its a supreme court order that any
private school can increase its fees

227
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,749
your son forgets everything.
He did not bring the fees

228
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:54,380
he was not ignoring

229
00:44:55,025 --> 00:45:00,156
he knows i dont have money thats
why he did not tell me

230
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:14,540
i just give him some punishment and
you come here

231
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:20,776
i have manage to arrange his school fees

232
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:29,858
we are asking just more

233
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:41,796
you need time?
You will get time

234
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:49,611

235
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:11,429
Thanks you remind me my position

236
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:18,538

237
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:51,764
what are you doing?

238
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:56,210
I'm doing my work

239
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:59,313
your religion tells you this?

240
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,017
You understand one thing

241
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:16,197

242
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,538
This month i will do

243
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,572
i dont understand this

244
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:31,344
you cant understand this

245
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:38,178
cut his fees from my salary

246
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,195
we wanna talk to you alone

247
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:34,602
sharma go outside

248
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:39,810
thank god you have come back

249
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:42,683
or sharma was about to sell school

250
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:51,450
he is right.
He misbehave with everyone

251
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,126
please stop sharma

252
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:10,544
do think sharma has that power and mind
that he can do this?

253
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:13,882
He is doing on my instructions

254
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:31,398
i also want co-operation from you

255
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:49,351
i cant see this

256
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,789
he is right

257
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:04,795
he is the most senior here.
I will also do the same

258
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,546
why you call all of us here?

259
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:02,123
I know what happened between you
and principal

260
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:08,797
but one thing is clear.
You cant understand one thing

261
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:19,304
you saw whatever happened there

262
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:29,710
thats why we have to do this

263
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,947
resignation is not the solution of problem

264
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:39,394
if principal will take action against
us then?

265
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:50,330
Atleast talk positive

266
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:54,570
if they take resignation then?
It wont happen

267
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:58,503
if all teachers resign together than
how a school will run?

268
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:31,012
Principal and management this
more far than you

269
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:40,411
new teacher willl come in place of you

270
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,517
they will do as management will say

271
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:51,592
i'm a poor guy.
Thats why i'm peon in school

272
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:56,570

273
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:22,656

275
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:47,850

You are well educated, you can think

276
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:51,453
because of this your school fees will be increased

277
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:06,963
we will increase your school
reputation

278
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:32,618

285
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:20,332
dont you think it will effect

286
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,003
Students will be tired

287
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:37,642
trust me students will enjoy

288
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:58,378
from now you wont learn
music

289
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:00,950
but why?

290
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:07,626

how can he make so many puppies
his friend?

296
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:25,336
He dont know how to do
friendship

297
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,201
they only listen to heart

298
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:06,080
it means Parth heart is better than
all of us

299
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:39,310
will you be my friend?

300
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:01,460

310
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:37,746
students are not stars

311
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:40,221

but he told this name now

376
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:02,008
is it necessary to say sponsors name?

377
01:22:54,736 --> 01:22:57,637
Press and media are outside

378
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:02,568
you wanted this?

379
01:23:11,786 --> 01:23:14,653
Do you know the meaning of trustee?

380
01:23:57,499 --> 01:23:59,399
What you did so that all students
go for strike?

381
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:02,233
Its a public question

382
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:09,836
i'm the principal of this school

383
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:13,446
i'm the responsible for this

384
01:24:15,183 --> 01:24:19,882
and for this i'm resigining

385
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:28,361
do you wanna ask anything?

386
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:52,578
All students want this

387
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:58,884
they are standing here because i know the truth

388
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:01,493
and i want you to tell them truth

389
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:23,942
i can understand

390
01:25:28,923 --> 01:25:31,619
they are your power

391
01:25:33,294 --> 01:25:35,228
tell them truth

392
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:41,300
nothing will happen

393
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:47,170
until now you were fighting alone.
Now we will fight together

394
01:26:55,643 --> 01:27:00,876
all come here to become student

395
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:12,548
only 2 professions students select
in my time

396
01:27:13,094 --> 01:27:15,324
doctor or engineer

397
01:27:40,488 --> 01:27:43,719
i dont wanted to share my time

398
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:46,156
thats why i did not marry

399
01:27:51,165 --> 01:27:53,690
i know everyone with their names

400
01:28:11,686 --> 01:28:14,917
i'm from Sarasvati Study Temple.
I'm in army now

401
01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:19,788
i'm the manager of this company

402
01:28:20,228 --> 01:28:23,857
i feel very good.
Nothing is better than this

403
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:31,066
i never think its a business.
Its always a profession for me

404
01:28:34,075 --> 01:28:36,566
now this profession has become
business

405
01:28:41,249 --> 01:28:48,246
we have to update everything. No matter
thinking is updated or not.

406
01:29:04,672 --> 01:29:07,937
Its not a 5 star hotel

407
01:29:21,522 --> 01:29:27,552
you are showing me the same
accounts since last 4 years

408
01:29:58,126 --> 01:29:59,354
world has changed

409
01:30:00,194 --> 01:30:01,957
competition is increased

410
01:30:03,164 --> 01:30:08,033
many schools has become business

411
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:17,669
our school's reputation is much better

412
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:57,442
if you dont give me much profit then
i will close down school

413
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:04,224
dont hope for any payment from me

414
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:37,084
try somewhere else

415
01:31:48,936 --> 01:31:51,564
i went to many banks and finance companies

416
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:01,345
but i did not lose hope

417
01:32:11,158 --> 01:32:13,353
i'm aditya sahaye

418
01:32:13,961 --> 01:32:17,556
your name is not in today's list.
I have appointment

419
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:25,134
sir is going overseas for 2 months,
you come after that

420
01:32:28,809 --> 01:32:30,834
all hopes were ended

421
01:33:20,928 --> 01:33:22,418
i wanted to share this with you

422
01:33:25,466 --> 01:33:29,402
but i thought you dont have much power

423
01:33:30,705 --> 01:33:33,435
you have more power than me

424
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:39,470
i know you got problem because of me

425
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:44,316
same problem was happenning with me

426
01:33:44,852 --> 01:33:46,717
please forgive me

427
01:33:56,931 --> 01:33:59,195
i dont had any profit in it

428
01:34:36,203 --> 01:34:39,695
i dont know how 32 years passed

429
01:35:56,717 --> 01:35:59,242
strike come to an end

430
01:36:01,222 --> 01:36:04,385
sad thing is that principal has resigned

431
01:36:04,959 --> 01:36:08,053
but we will remember his thoughts

432
01:36:44,431 --> 01:36:47,366
i left something here.
Thats why i come here to collect

433
01:36:53,274 --> 01:36:59,509
by your age and experience,
you are great

434
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:08,987
this school needs a principal

435
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:06,537
tell the staff that there is a meeting
in my office at 5 pm

436
01:39:44,812 --> 01:39:47,576

Some wine, ma'am?
- Thank you.

All the business days...

16
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,080
I heard that.

17
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,560
Yeah.

18
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,080
Oh God, I am late.

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,800
Just where the hell is
that interpreter?

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,880
These two morons are giving me
bloody migraine.

Alright. Thank you.

Thanks.

No!

24
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,240
Alright.
- Maybe we shouldn't.

25
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,360
It might have religious sentiments.

26
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640

Greetings, Mrs Singh.

34
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,440
You're Indian, right?
- Yes.

35
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
My name is Ria.

36
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,160
I am the guest relations officer
with this hotel,

37
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,120
and a part time interpreter too.

38
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
Thank God.

39
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,080
At least someone speaks Hindi here.

40
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,960
Well nowadays, most Indians
prefer to speak English,

41
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,680
but our guests don't.

42
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,160
That's why you were brought in

43
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,800
to help.
- Okay.

44
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,920
Hi, mom.
- Adi.

45
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,720
You should have gotten here
before I did.

46
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,440
You know how important
this deal is for us.

47
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
I know.

48
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,680
Hi.
- Hi.

49
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,880
Well, as you know my husband
Vikram Singh started this company,

50
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,840
Vikramaditya Group Of Industries,

51
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,320
15 years ago.

52
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,960
Today, as we go global,

53
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,240
I wish he was alive to see this.

54
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,480
'I wish he was alive to see this.'

55
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,120
Aditya my son here handles the
international business division.

56
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,800
Don't be fooled by his chocolate looks.

57
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,160
There is a sharp business mind with
an international finance degree

58
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,200
behind it that works non-stop.

59
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
Arabic!

60
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,800
When did you learn Arabic?

61
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,120
That's all the Arabic I know.
- Hey, Adam!

62
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
One second.

63
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,720
Excuse me. I have to go.

64
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,280
Excuse me.
- Please wait.

65
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,720
They do not bother to understand
our people, our language or our country.

66
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,680
The Americans gave us slavery,
we gave them presidents for two terms.

67
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,400
You knew he could speak English!

68
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,480
What's so funny?

69
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You may go now.

70
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,880
'She didn't know what she had done.'

71
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,080
My mom was upset with her.

72
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,760
And she would never be forgiven
for her mistake.

73
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,840
I am sure that we will enjoy

74
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,640
a mutually respectful
and beneficial relationship.

75
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,760
You give us the raw material and
we will give you a honest price.

76
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,400
Together we will explore new markets.

77
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,920
Deal?
- Deal.

78
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,080
Yeah.

79
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,720
Ladies and gentlemen, dinner is served.

80
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,040
After you, ma'am.

81
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,280
Okay. Come.

82
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,880
Well, Mr Ali, I hope you've been
enjoying your stay at the hotel here.

83
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,880
If there is anything you need,
please feel free to call Aditya.

84
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,480
He will always be available.

85
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,320
'Well, as you know my husband
Vikram Singh started this company'

86
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,520
'Vikramaditya Group Of Industries,
15 years ago.'

87
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,480
'Today, as we go global'

88
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,080
'I wish he was alive to see this.'

89
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
'I am sorry, dad.'

90
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,480
'Adi!'
- Save him.

91
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,080
'Adi!'

92
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,160
'Dad!'

93
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,720
'Adi!'

94
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Sorry, mom.

95
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,600
20 missed calls, Adi.

96
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,280
Where had you been?

97
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
It's rude

98
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,200
to leave the guests without
informing anyone.

99
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
I got tired, mom,

100
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,160
so I came to my room.

101
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,560
And I dozed off.

102
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,920
And where are you now?

103
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,800
I am in the room.
- Really?

104
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Shit!

105
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,880
'He got there first.'

106
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,160
'Klinsmann challenging him.'

107
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,320
'Putting Klinsmann in the game
on the far side.'

108
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,720
Clause 77 B doesn't seem
right in the contract.

109
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,960
We shouldn't give them
so much advantage.

110
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,080
What do you think, Adi?

111
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,040
'Goes off for the challenge.'

112
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,960
'Argentina down to ten men.
The first man ever'

113
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,600
'to be sent off in a world cup final.'

114
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,640
Your entire generation will go deaf
before they turn 40.

115
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,560
The volume is too high.

116
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,400
I can't even hear myself.

117
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,000
Hello.

118
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,520
My phone is ringing somewhere.

119
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,680
Over there. It's not here.

120
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,600
'I'm a great admirer
of German football.'

121
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,760
'They have played some of the best games
over the last 15 years.'

122
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,200
Hello.

123
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
Hello.

124
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,880
'There's no question, it's a foul.'

125
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,560
I can't hear anything.

126
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,080
Set the TV on mute.

127
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
'Not been...'

128
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,560
Sorry. Yes, tell me.

129
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,400
'Hello, Mrs Singh, I am speaking
from the Parulkar Heart Institute.'

130
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,560
'We have found a donor.
Can you come here tomorrow?'

131
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,440
But I am in Dubai and I've a very
important meeting tomorrow morning.

132
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,120
'Ma'am, we have found a donor
with great difficulty.'

133
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,840
'You won't get such
an opportunity again.'

134
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,160
Fine. I will be there. Bye.

135
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
Adi, I am going back.

136
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,320
I will take the morning flight.

137
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,400
Oh God, I hate this!

138
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,080
I hate to leave you here.

139
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,960
This isn't the first time.

140
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,920
Adi, you've to sign the deal
on Monday. Don't forget.

141
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,680
I don't know how we will pull this off.

142
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,200
It's a weekend.

143
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,840
Why are you going?

144
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,640
What could be more important for you
than this multi-million dollar contract?

145
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
Huh?

146
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,640
You.

147
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
But I am here.

148
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,720
Adi, they found a perfect match,

149
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,360
after trying for two years.

150
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,200
That's not the perfect match.

151
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,920
I don't like it.

152
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,560
What are you talking about?

153
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,520
You're going to Mumbai to meet
Trehan, right? - Yes, but...

154
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,920
Stop talking nonsense.

155
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,800
Monday at 11 AM. Don't oversleep.

156
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,880
Adi,

157
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,280
I've worked hard for
the company's success.

158
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,080
Now, this is the next big step.

159
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,480
But first, I want you to be
completely okay.

160
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,080
Yeah.

161
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,200
'I've told you many times that
I don't want a heart transplant.'

162
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,840
'But you've always done'

163
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,640
'what you want.'

164
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,000
Okay?
- Thank you very much.

165
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,360
Thanks.
- Thanks.

166
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,720
I hate to leave you over here.

167
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,360
Don't sleep late in the night,

168
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,360
and don't forget to take your vitamins
after breakfast. Did you hear me?

169
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,640
Yes.

170
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,440
Will you wake up in time for breakfast?

171
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,760
Okay, mom. I will wake up
and take my vitamins as well.

172
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,720
I will take care of everything.

173
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,000
You should get going,
otherwise you'll miss your flight.

174
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,120
You seem to be in hurry
to send me away.

175
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,640
Take care.
- Love you, mom.

176
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,800
See you. Don't roam around much. Okay?
- Okay, mom.

177
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,120
Alright. Bye.
- Bye.

178
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,720
'What do I wish for?'

179
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,120
'What is this feeling?'

180
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,400
'The one I didn't know until yesterday, '

181
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,000
'is with me every moment now.'

182
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,760
'Which colour is this?'

183
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,640
'Whose company is this?'

184
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,640
'What is this rhythm?'

185
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,520
'Whose voice is this?'

186
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,800
'Why do I feel restless?'

187
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,000
'Why does her fragrance
enthral me?'

188
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,440
'I haven't met her yet.'

189
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,080
'Why then'

190
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,880
'is she always around?'

191
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,640
'What do I wish for?'

192
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,480
'What is this feeling?'

193
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,120
<i>âª O Lord, tell me
what's happening to me. âª</i>

194
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:22,160
<i>âª I have lost my heart
for the first time. âª</i>

195
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:28,320

everywhere. âª</i>

196
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:35,240
<i>âª I don't know how I lost my heart. âª</i>

197
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:42,840

desires seem to have awakened. âª</i>

198
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:50,120
<i>âª For once, come to me and

How will I âª</i>

00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,680

201
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:07,760
<i>âª My darling, I live for you. âª</i>

202
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:16,080
<i>âª O my beloved. âª</i>

203
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:38,480
<i>âª Why does love hurt so much? âª</i>

204
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,080
<i>âª I feel restless day and night. âª</i>

205
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:50,120

206
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,880
<i>âª You tell me what to do? âª</i>

207
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,200

215
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:43,080
<i>âª I believe, I'm alive and I know

216
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:49,920

217
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,400
<i>âª I can tell that to the world. âª</i>

218
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:01,280
<i>âª Far away from

219
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,120

222

226
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,840
<i>âª O my beloved. âª</i>

227
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,440
<i>âª O my beloved. âª</i>

228
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,800
Do you want white powder?

229
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,960
Hey, do you want white powder?

230
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,040
It's good quality. Do you want some?

231
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,640
Dude, want some cocaine?

232
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,560
White powder. It's really fresh stuff.

233
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,040
Everybody buys it from me.

234
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,280
So, you want some?

235
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,600
It's amazing stuff.
- I don't do drugs, man. Seriously.

236
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,480
Okay, listen,

237
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,760
would you like to buy diamonds?
I've got d-class VVS.

238
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,600
It's five carat
at 25 percent jewellery price.

239
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,600
It's amazing Dubai's stuff.

240
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Would you like to buy it?

241
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,720
Tell me if you want to buy.

242
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,520
Want it?

243
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,240
Let's go.

244
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
Come on.

245
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,000
You're going to love this, bro.

246
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,320
Good.
- Yes.

247
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
Very good.

248
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,200
10,000 dollars.

249
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Ten dollars.

250
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,320
What are you saying, man?

251
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,840
10,000 dollars!

252
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,400
Ten dollars.
- What?

253
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,320
Check this out, bro.

254
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,680
I know the class, cut, caratage
and clarity of this diamond.

255
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,160
It's all good.

256
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,800
I do diamonds, you see.

257
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,720
You were going to give
this to me, weren't you?

258
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,360
As far as I know, it's a fake.

259
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,560
But anyway, you know what?

260
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,360
I like your style.

261
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I will take it.

262
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,600
Ten dollars.

263
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,800
Damn! You short played me, man!

264
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,200
By the way,

265
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,520
if you deal in real diamonds,

266
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,520
what will you do with a fake?

267
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,120
It may be a fake for you,

268
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
but for me, it's real.

269
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,680
It's the first independent deal
of my life.

270
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,400
It's party time.

271
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,920
Excuse me.

272
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,280
Yes, sir.
- One espresso please.

273
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,400
Sure.

274
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Hey.

275
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,360
Keep the change.
- Thank you, sir.

276
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,000
Screwed, man.

277
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,960
I don't know how to thank you, Trehan.

278
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,800
Sanjeev.

279
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Gayatri,

280
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,120
don't raise your hopes too much.

281
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,520
I've already told you that a transplant
doesn't guarantee anything.

282
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,080
This surgery has
a minimal success rate.

283
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,720
The body could reject the heart
even after a transplant.

284
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,040
And if Adi doesn't want
to undergo surgery,

285
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,160
his attitude will further reduce
his chances.

286
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,960
Let me deal with his attitude.

287
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,680
I will convince him.

288
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,600
Now that we have found a donor,
it will be easy to convince him.

289
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,840
I have a request, Sanjeev.

290
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,040
You must perform the surgery.

291
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,040
I can't trust anyone else.

292
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,760
You know what Adi means to me.

293
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,800
Of course, Gayatri.

294
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,120
I will explain the entire procedure
to you tomorrow.

295
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,440
I have the tapes of some surgeries that
I had performed.

296
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,240
You can see them.
- Okay.

297
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,240
You'll get an idea.
- Okay.

298
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,680
Oh! It's 1:30.

299
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
Lunch?

300
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,520
I am really tired. I'm came here
directly from the airport.

301
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
Rain check?

302
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,560
But you will eat, won't you?

303
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,120
I don't want to go out.

304
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,800
Besides,

305
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,360
I've to talk to Adi.
I'll just take two minutes.

306
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,800
Pass.

307
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
Here.

308
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,640
Man!

309
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,240
Come back here.

310
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,760
'No, Adi, you can't play football.'

311
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,960
Give the ball. Pass the ball.

312
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,280
Please, give the ball.

313
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,280
Come on, man.
- Sorry.

314
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,400
I am coming there.

315
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,280
Okay.
- Pass the ball.

316
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,840
That's our ball.
- Chill, guys.

317
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,200
Yes!

318
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,640
Hey, mom.

319
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,360
Hi, Adi.
- Did you reach safely?

320
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,480
How's the temperature?
- The temperature!

321
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,840
It's Mumbai. Always the same.

322
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,960
Not Mumbai. I am talking about
Trehan's temperature.

323
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,760
Oh! Shut up.

324
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,480
Where are you?
- Mom, I am just chilling.

325
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,840
Hanging out, you know.

326
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,720
No late nights, okay? Please.

327
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,200
You too, mom. Please!

328
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
Okay.

329
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,000
Mom, I got to go. Okay?

330
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,040
Love you, mom. Bye.
- Bye.

331
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,480
Make it.

332
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,360
Naughty fellow.

333
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,440
Come.
- Thanks.

334
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,280
Children grow up, Gayatri.

335
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,160
A single woman like you

336
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,600
should think about her life.

337
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,200
Adi is my life.

338
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,840
By the way, Sanjeev, how is Ila?

339
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,040
She is good, I guess.

340
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,840
She is on

341
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,680
her third vacation trip this year.
Malay forests.

342
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,080
Gayatri, you know that

343
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,880
we were together just for the children.

344
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,920
And now, the children have
all grown up.

345
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,560
I take your leave.

346
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,440
And thanks once again.

347
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,040
Okay.

348
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,200
Don't touch me!

349
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,400
'Hey, how are you, baby?'

350
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,960
Dare touch me!
- The camera...

351
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,600
Baby!
- Leave me alone.

352
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,120
What's your price, baby?
- Come with us.

353
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,040
Wow! You're looking so hot.

354
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,480
Hey!

355
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,600
What's your rate, baby?
- Look at her. Yeah!

356
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,080
Hey!

357
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,560
Who are you waving at?

358
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,440
Hey.
- We are here. Who are you waving at?

359
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
Stop it!

360
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,960
Oh, wow! Look at her.

361
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,080
Hey, guys!

362
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,000
Yes. Who is he?
- Who are you?

363
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,760
Are you guys tourists?

364
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,240
Hey, dude, buzz off.

365
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,960
Yeah, right.

366
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,040
Hi.

367
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,480
Hey, who are you? Back off.

368
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,680
Alright...

369
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,400
Sure. She needs to go too.

370
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,120
Come on.
- Hey, wait.

371
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,440
Back off, wise guy!
- Get going, dude.

372
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,360
Do you know her?

373
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,160
Yes.
- No.

374
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,240
What an idiot!

375
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,840
Run!

376
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,440
Run!
- Catch them!

377
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,680
What was that?
- Pepper spray.

378
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,760
What?

379
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,160
Do you always carry it?
- Yes.

380
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,680
So that I can save people like you.

381
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,480
What? Run.

382
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,880
Run.

383
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,960
Stop running!

384
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,400
Okay, Lara Croft,

385
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,960
we are safe now.

386
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,880
I am Ria.
- Okay.

387
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,360
Ria.

388
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,080
Do you remember the way to hotel?

389
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,880
May be.

390
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,800
You shouldn't roam around alone.

391
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,120
It's dangerous.

392
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,720
Can I drop you to the hotel?

393
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,000
Yeah, sure.

394
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,400
But where is the car?

395
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,000
I don't have a car.

396
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,600
No car. How do we get there?

397
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,160
Okay, let's walk.
- Let's go.

398
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,800
You're on a business trip, right?
- Yeah.

399
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,800
But your mom went back.

400
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,840
Are you on a holiday?
- No.

401
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,360
It was the weekend,

402
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,280
so I stayed back.

403
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,600
Are you a local?

404
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,240
No. I am from Afghanistan.
- Oh!

405
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,640
I lost my parents in a car bombing.

406
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,800
I was the only survivor.

407
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,880
I am sorry.

408
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,720
I couldn't forgive myself
for a long time

409
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,240
for having survived.

410
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,560
But then I thought I should live

411
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,080
their share of life as well.

412
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,000
Perhaps, I will find peace.

413
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,680
Since then life's been good.

414
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,560
It's just been a month
since I came here.

415
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,560
Earlier I was at the Cairo branch
of the same hotel.

416
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480
Oh!

417
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,360
That's why you speak Arabic!

418
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,960
Yes, you're right.
- Okay.

419
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,720
Here we are.

420
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,640
Well, thank you

421
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,560
for saving me from the goons
and bringing me here safe and sound.

422
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,160
Would you like to have coffee?

423
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,440
Hotel staff

424
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,480
can't socialise with
the guests at the hotel.

425
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,000
There are rules. Sorry.

426
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,000
Bye.

427
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,160
Congrats, Mr Singh.
- Here we go.

428
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,680
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

429
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,520
Cheers to our alliance, Mr Ali.

430
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,040
Cheers!
- Cheers!

431
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,160
Together we will conquer new horizons.

432
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,640
And Adi,

433
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,800
well done. I am proud of you.

434
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,840
Now, come home soon.

435
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,800
Miss you.
- I miss you too.

436
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,280
Just signing the deal isn't enough.

437
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,680
The manufacturing and delivery

438
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,240
should be exactly as per schedule.

439
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,400
Make new schedules. I want to see them.

440
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,640
But there's place in our schedule
for this new order.

441
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,040
Then make the schedule accordingly.
- But ma'am...

442
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,600
Our workers are already
working two shifts.

443
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,120
We can't push them.

444
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,080
There can be a third shift.

445
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,040
I don't want excuses.

446
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,680
What if the workers refuse?

447
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,640
Then replace them.

448
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,960
Okay.

449
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,160
Mr Mahajan,

450
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,840
I pay you to find the answers,
not to ask questions.

451
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,440
Just do it.
- Okay.

452
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,640
Radhika, come with me.

453
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
Yes, ma'am.

454
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,800
Adi's ticket is confirmed.

455
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,720
Don't forget to send a car for him.

456
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,360
Ma'am, Mr Singh has extended his trip.

457
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,240
He isn't arriving tomorrow.
- What?

458
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,720
Why didn't you tell me?

459
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,080
How can he change the ticket
without asking me?

460
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,240
Call him.
- Okay.

461
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,720
'The number you're trying to reach
is currently not reachable.'

462
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,200
Switched off.

463
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
Hi!

464
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,040
Let's go out for a stroll.

465
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,760
Sorry, I am on duty.

466
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,960
Your Mr Adam Kowalski has booked me

467
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,840
for interpretation.
- Oh!

468
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,640
I asked him to do that.

469
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,880
What?
- Yes.

470
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,400
Let's go. Come on.

471
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,360
Why do you need an interpreter?
- I don't.

472
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,920
Come on. Let's go. I want you
to show me Dubai today.

473
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,880
Come on. Sit.

474
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,160
<i>âª Whenever I see you, you seem divine. âª</i>

475
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,480
<i>âª I wonder what's the connection
between us. âª</i>

476
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,960
<i>âª Whenever I see you, you seem divine. âª</i>

477
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,160
<i>âª I wonder what's the connection
between us. âª</i>

478
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,560
<i>âª I wonder why I look for ways
to get close to you. âª</i>

479
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,240
<i>âª By God, I will leave this world
if you say so. âª</i>

480
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,440
<i>âª It's mesmerising, your smile. âª</i>

481
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,960
<i>âª It's enchanting, when you blush. âª</i>

482
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,040
<i>âª You affect me.
I want to make you mine. âª</i>

483
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,320
<i>âª It's mesmerising, your smile. âª</i>

484
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,840
<i>âª It's enchanting, when you blush. âª</i>

485
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,120
<i>âª Oh yeah! âª</i>

486
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,400
<i>âª Your eyes speak a million words. âª</i>

487
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:05,040
<i>âª My heart skips a beat
at a mere glimpse of you. âª</i>

488
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,440
<i>âª I was so lonely before I met you. âª</i>

489
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,960
<i>âª It seems I was waiting for you. âª</i>

490
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,440
<i>âª Let me stare at you for a while,
if you don't mind. âª</i>

491
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,680
<i>âª It's mesmerising, your smile. âª</i>

492
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:27,040
<i>âª It's enchanting, when you blush. âª</i>

493
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:47,720
<i>âª I'm in love. âª</i>

494
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,040
<i>âª I miss you day and night. âª</i>

495
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,760
<i>âª You mean more to me than life. âª</i>

496
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,680
<i>âª Take me in your arms
and hold me tight. âª</i>

497
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,600
<i>âª I want to be with you all my life. âª</i>

498
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,680
<i>âª Let's get closer and make sure
nothing ever gets between us. âª</i>

499
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,080
<i>âª It's mesmerising, your smile. âª</i>

500
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:17,480
<i>âª It's enchanting, when you blush. âª</i>

501
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,800
<i>âª Whenever I see you, you seem divine. âª</i>

502
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,120
<i>âª I wonder what's the connection
between us. âª</i>

503
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,440
<i>âª I wonder why I look for ways
to get close to you. âª</i>

504
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,240
<i>âª By God, I will leave this world
if you say so. âª</i>

505
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,520
<i>âª It's mesmerising, your smile. âª</i>

506
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:43,600
<i>âª It's enchanting, when you blush. âª</i>

507
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,880
<i>âª My darling... âª</i>

508
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,800
<i>âª Come closer. âª</i>

509
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,720
<i>âª My darling... âª</i>

510
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,360
Okay. Good night.

511
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,960
Hold on, Ria.

512
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,440
Just a moment.

513
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,840
This is for you.

514
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,360
Do you like it?

515
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,520
Why are you giving this to me?

516
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
No particular reason.

517
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,880
Without rhyme or reason?
- Yes.

518
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,560
We spend a lovely time together,

519
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,680
so I thought I should give you a gift.

520
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,520
So that we can have

521
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,280
a lot more fun next time.

522
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,760
Fun?
- Yes.

523
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,480
Next time?
- Yes.

524
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,560
I thought you're different from others,

525
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,120
but you're worse than them.
- What?

526
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,680
They are what they seem to be.

527
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,960
Who do you think you are?

528
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,040
Did you think

529
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,720
a diamond ring will make me
jump into your arms?

530
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,400
You think you can buy me!

531
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,960
Do you think I am for sale? Here.

532
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,200
Wait. No, Ria...

533
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,600
Ria, listen to me.

534
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,960
Just leave me alone. Go away.
- Let me explain.

535
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,680
I was just kidding.

536
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,520
You are getting it wrong. It's just...

537
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,640
It's just a ring. Come on.

538
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,120
Come on, man. Give me a break.

539
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,320
Ria, that guy has been staring
at you for a very long time.

540
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,640
What's his problem?

541
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,120
Cheers!

542
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,200
What the hell is going on?

543
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,280
Stop it.

544
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,720
Just stop it!

545
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,640
I have just begun.

546
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,840
What do you want?

547
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,960
I want you to listen to me carefully.

548
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,960
And then do whatever you want.

549
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,800
Go ahead.

550
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,120
Come with me.
- Look, it's the same girl.

551
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,040
Yes, pal.
- So, what's her price?

552
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,360
Ten dollars.

553
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,400
And she thought it was extravagant.

554
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,160
Do you get it now?

555
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,760
I bought the diamond ring
for just ten dollars.

556
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,560
Why didn't you tell me?

557
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,320
Excuse me.

558
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,120
Did you give me a chance?

559
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,840
Before you gave it to me, you idiot!

560
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,000
I don't like trophy boyfriends.

561
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,760
Trophy boyfriends?
- Yes.

562
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,320
They have credit cards, but no hearts.

563
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,560
For them,
money speaks louder than words.

564
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,040
I avoid such people.

565
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,720
I am looking for someone

566
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,720
who is simple

567
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,600
and kind hearted.

568
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,400
I am not good at heart, Ria.

569
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,120
'Perhaps, I was at a point in my life'

570
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,680
'from where I couldn't go back'

571
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,120
'or move forward.'

572
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,960
'It was as simple as that'

573
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,880
'and as complicated.'

574
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,120
Adi!

575
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,600
Adi.

576
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,880
Oh my God!

577
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,280
What's wrong?

578
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,360
Open your mouth. Quickly.

579
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,840
Somebody help!

580
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,920
Adi, what happened to you?

581
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,840
Adi.

582
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,160
I told you

583
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,360
I am not good at heart.

584
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,440
Adi!

585
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,760
Good morning.

586
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,240
Good morning.

587
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,720
Nothing to worry.

588
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,640
All your reports are normal.

589
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,080
You scared me.

590
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,680
You gave me a new life.

591
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,600
You've also changed my life.

592
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,320
We are quits.

593
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,600
I can't do this.

594
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,400
You shouldn't be here. You have to go.

595
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,120
When I am not worried about the future,

596
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,040
why are you afraid?

597
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:03,280
<i>âª Love is the Lord's blessing.
Love is everyoneÃ¢ s wish. âª</i>

598

621
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,400
Good morning.

622
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,320
I will just get ready. Okay?

623
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,160
Adi.

624
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,440
Ria.
- What?

625
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,040
I can't do this.

626
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,200
Of course, you can.

627
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,800
Now we are together.

628
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,800
We will do it.

629
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,680
Ria,

630
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,120
we can't let our emotions
get the better of us.

631
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,440
Our emotions are overwhelming, Adi.

632
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,720
Are you having second thoughts about me?

633
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,440
What happened to you
all of a sudden, Aditya?

634
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,240
Listen to me, Adi.

635
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,040
I know you're scared.

636
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,120
Don't worry.

637
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,600
Everything will be fine.

638
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,800
Let's just live the moment.

639
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,400
Let's not worry about the future.

640
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,640
That's the problem, Ria.

641
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,840
This relationship is like my life.

642
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,280
It has no future.

643
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,960
Please end this relationship.

644
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,840
You deserve better.

645
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,760
You're right.

646
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,560
You don't have a future.

647
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,560
But I do.

648
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,480
Do you know why?

649
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,080
Because you measure life
by the years you live.

650
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,800
Whereas I live in the moment.

651
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,040
I await a better life,

652
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,840
whereas you await death.

653
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,880
Hence, don't even think that you

654
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,200
are doing me a favour by
ending this relationship.

655
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,560
You don't have the courage
to live, Aditya.

656
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,880
You're a coward.

657
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,320
Have a safe tour back to India,
Mr Singh.

658
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,320
Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

659
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,000
Hey, bro!

660
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,480
Hey, Adi.
- What's up?

661
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,160
So nice to see you.

662
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,880
I missed you, Sam.
- Missed you too.

663
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,736
How are you?
- I'm fine. Thank you. What about you?

664
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,600
Fantastic.
- What a pleasant surprise!

665
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,800
When did you return from Dubai?
- This morning.

666
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,320
What did you bring for me?

667
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,920
Sorry, no gifts.

668
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,240
No. That's okay.

669
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,440
Rich people usually give gifts
to those who don't need them.

670
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Stop it, Sam.

671
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,960
Sam, I want to get the transplant done.

672
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,480
I'm ready for it.
- I knew it.

673
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,360
I knew it.

674
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,120
You haven't returned empty-handed.

675
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,840
You have an interesting story
to tell me.

676
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,680
Tell me, hurry up.
- Patience. By the way,

677
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,680
new car, right? I love it.

678
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,360
Enjoying the false pride.

679
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,760
I'm getting late for the clinic.

680
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,720
Come, let's talk on the way.
- Okay. Let's go.

681
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,560
Her name is Ria.

682
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,280
Ria?
- Yeah.

683
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,680
Oh! She's the magician

684
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,600
who made you change your decision.

685
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,360
You kept refusing for so long

686
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,800
and now all of a sudden you're
ready for the operation!

687
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,480
Ria seems to be an amazing girl.

688
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,200
How did she manage to convince you?

689
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,200
She must've done it affectionately.

690
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,520
'You don't have the courage
to live, Aditya.'

691
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,040
'You're a coward.'

692
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,000
Does your mom know?

693
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,560
'No escape.
- No way, mom.'

694
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,920
'I'm so happy, Adi.'

695
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,320
'I wanted to talk to you about
the transplant.'

696
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,760
She must be very excited to know
that you are ready for the transplant.

697
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,440
She must have spoken to
the Dr Trehan by now.

698
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,960
You will perform the surgery, Sam.

699
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,840
Think about the risk, Adi.

700
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,640
More often than not

701
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,560
such complicated cases end in failure.

702
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,280
When you have someone like Dr Trehan
and his team, why do you want me?

703
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,720
I don't like Trehan.

704
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,080
Come on, Adi.

705
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,760
He's a reputed heart surgeon.

706
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,800
He's perfect for the surgery.

707
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,600
His only drawback is that
he is crazy about your mom.

708
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,280
So what's wrong with that?
- Yeah.

709
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,720
After all, you are crazy about
someone too.

710
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,200
Whatever.

711
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,920
Let's see.

712
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,160
Hello.
- Hey, mom.

713
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,960
Hi.
- Hi, Adi.

714
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,960
Dr Trehan and I wanted to see
what's special about this hospital

715
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,480
that you insist on
undergoing surgery over here.

716
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,040
How can you pass judgement
even before getting inside?

717
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,040
Come on, Adi. I am sensible enough
to understand.

718
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,520
Relax, Gayatri.

719
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,480
The success of an operation
doesn't merely depend on the hospital.

720
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,960
It also requires competent hands
and experience.

721
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,200
Let me deal with this.

722
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,160
I want to carry out some tests.

723
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,240
Okay.
- I want to do some fresh tests on Adi.

724
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,080
If you're talking about me,

725
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
talk to me.

726
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,640
Listen, son...
- I'm not your son.

727
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,760
Adi!

728
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,160
Please, don't try to be my dad.

729
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,480
Let me tell you this, mom.

730
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,680
Dr Trehan doesn't need to do all this.

731
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,400
Sam will operate on me.

732
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,000
Are you crazy?

733
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,680
How can he perform such a big surgery?

734
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,160
Although we have Dr Trehan with us!

735
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,320
Sam is my friend, mom.

736
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,480
No doctor would care more
for my life than him.

737
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,040
He saved my life once
and you know that, right?

738
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,800
What made you think
that I will allow it?

739
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,720
Mom, you didn't hear me.

740
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,400
I'm not asking you.

741
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,120
I'm just informing you.

742
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,920
This is ridiculous.

743
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:44,280
I won't allow some run-off-the-mill
doctor to operate on my son.

744
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,400
Adi.

745
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,080
I'll be in my office. Call me later.

746
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,440
Bye, Mrs Singh.

747
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,840
Bye, Dr Trehan.
- Sam...

748
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,720
Adi, we need to talk about this, okay?

749
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,120
Call me.

750
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,680
'I have complete faith in Sam.'

751
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,760
'He's my friend, '

752
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,760
'father and brother.'

753
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,640
'Everything.'

754
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,640
'Now, '

755
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,960
'he's going to give me
a new lease of life.'

756
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:28,080
<i>âª It's no longer a rugged
road when you're around. âª</i>

757
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,080
<i>âª Every journey becomes fun
when you're with me. âª</i>

758
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:38,360
<i>âª You're a shade in the sunshine. âª</i>

759
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:43,320
<i>âª You're the guiding
force in my life. âª</i>

760
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:48,240
<i>âª I share a lot of good
memories with you. âª</i>

761
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,280
<i>âª I want to say this
to you every moment. âª</i>

762
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:58,200
<i>âª Thanks brother, for being there. âª</i>

763
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:03,600
<i>âª Thanks brother, for being there. âª</i>

764
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,360
Sam,

765
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,440
we have been trying to find
Ria for the last two months.

766
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,680
But we haven't got any information
about her yet.

767
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,960
I don't know what to do.

768
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,920
I cannot live without her.

769
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,000
On an aircraft, we're told

770
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,920
to wear the oxygen
masks ourselves first

771
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,600
before helping others.

772
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,640
Likewise, you need to get well first.

773
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,120
Then we'll find Ria.

774
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,680
Have patience.

775
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,040
We're already late.

776
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,680
On top of that, it has started raining.

777
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,120
The governor had to throw a party today.

778
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,600
Who's she?

779
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,840
Mom, she's Ria.

780
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,280
She's my friend Harshad's sister.

781
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,480
Something seems to be wrong.
You carry on. I'll be with you shortly.

782
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,520
Come soon, I'll send
the car back for you.

783
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,760
Let me take you to the car.

784
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,040
Bye.

785
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,720
Ria, I'm so happy to see you.

786
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,800
I thought we would never meet again.

787
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,800
I don't believe this.

788
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,880
When did you come here?

789
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,680
And how?

790
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,160
I tried a lot to forget you,

791
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,840
but couldn't.

792
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,360
That's why, I'm here. But you...

793
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,960
You didn't even acknowledge
me in front of your mom.

794
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,080
I'm such an idiot

795
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,040
to have come all the way here for you.

796
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,280
Ria, listen to me.

797
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:50,960
I love you.

798
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,400
Come inside.

799
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,360
Please.

800
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,080
What about your mom?

801
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,600
Mom, she's Ria.
- I know.

802
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:16,800
I remember her now.

803
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,240
Is she not the girl who
was an interpreter in Dubai?

804
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,800
You lied to me that she
was your friend's sister.

805
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,240
This is unfair.

806
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,120
You know this is a diplomatic function.

807
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,600
You cannot bring any
random person here.

808
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,960
Let's go home.

809
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,640
Tell her to arrange for her
stay somewhere else.

810
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,160
Mom...

811
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,000
You are not the only person
she knows here.

812
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,560
Mom, stop it.

813
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,720
She doesn't know anyone here.

814
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,600
How can I leave her alone?

815
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,280
Besides, it's quite late.

816
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,360
She should have thought about
it before coming here.

817
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,600
She loves me, mom.

818
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,120
That's why she didn't
bother about anything.

819
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,240
But you won't understand.

820
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,600
Because...

821
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,800
She cannot come inside.

822
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:25,920
Are you coming inside?

823
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,800
You have decided already.

824
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,240
As usual.

825
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,280
Hey, Sam.
- Hi, Adi.

826
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,800
It's quite late. Is everything okay?
Come on in.

827
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:55,960
Just a second, Sam.

828
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,040
I have someone with me.

829
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,960
Come.

830
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,800
Ria.
- Ria!

831
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,760
Are you kidding me?

832
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,240
Hi, Ria.
- Hello.

833
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,000
Sorry, I cannot take her anywhere else,

834
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,240
so I brought her here.
- Get inside, first. Come on.

835
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,320
Come on.

836
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:22,240
'The number you've dialled is
currently unavailable.'

837
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,480
'Please try again later.'

838
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,040
'The number you've...'

839
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,400
Okay.

840
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,880
Adi, speak to your mom once.

841
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,960
She must have calmed down by now.

842
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,040
I can imagine her shock
when she saw Ria.

843
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,320
You should have told her before.

844
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,200
Anyway, not too late even now.

845
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,320
Trust me, everything will be fine.

846
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,760
You're right, Sam.

847
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,440
I should go home.
- Wait a second, Adi.

848
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,960
My entire team is coming to
my house tomorrow morning.

849
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:04,800
If they see Ria here...

850
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,960
I mean, I'm unmarried...

851
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,440
They might misconstrue...

852
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:09,800
I don't care.

853
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,880
But Ria...

854
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:21,720
<i>âª Let my eyes close slowly. âª</i>

855
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,800
<i>âª Let me fall asleep. âª</i>

856
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:40,040
<i>âª Let sleep sweep me away
into a beautiful dream. âª</i>

857
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,200
Ria.
- Yes?

858
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,240
Marry me.

859
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:48,960
What!

860
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,320
Right now.

861
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,480
Marry me.

862
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,040
It's five o' clock in the morning.

863
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:13,080
'The number you have
dialled is busy.'

864
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,400
Gayatri, I have already told you.

865
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,520
When children grow up,
you have to let go.

866
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:22,640
He's not like others, he needs me.

867
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,280
He should accept this.

868
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,680
But he's not thinking straight.

869
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,400
He's taken a wrong decision.

870
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,080
Forget about it.

871
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,640
If he has already decided,

872
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,360
you cannot impose your decision on him.

873
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,200
You need to be positive.

874
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,400
When a drop of water

875
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,720
swells a bit,

876
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,640
it speaks as if the ocean.

877
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,120
Lamps would have been blown out by now,

878
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:54,920
but there's someone

879
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,040
who prevents the wind.

880
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:02,040
No one can defy the verdict

881
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,480
passed by the supreme authority.

882
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,240
Mr Singh, please sign here.

883
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,240
Take this.

884
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,440
Thank you.

885
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,320
Okay.

886
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,120
Hear! Hear!

887
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,880
Congratulations! From now on you
are husband and wife. - Thank you.

888
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,360
Thank you.
- Congrats!

889
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,680
Love you, Sam.
- Love you too, Adi.

890
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:03,000
<i>âª I have found a place in your heart. âª</i>

891
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,400

896
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,240

01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:31,480

901
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,480

902

913
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,680

914
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:59,880

01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:17,480
<i>âª What a feeling! âª</i>

918
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,640
What happened, Aditya?

919
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,040
I got a call from Sam.

920
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,640
I'm sorry, Aditya.

921
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,840
I had to call you all
of a sudden because

922
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,400
we found donor all of a sudden.

923
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:49,440
I hope you're completely
prepared for the operation.

924
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:50,440
I guess.

925
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,200
Hi! Are you Mr Aditya Singh?
- Yes.

926
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:53,600
Your mom is waiting for you

927
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,480
at the reception area
along with Dr Trehan.

928
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,080
Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

929
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,560
How did you come to know that
I was getting operated today?

930
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,280
I'm your mom.

931
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,720
Just a second.

932
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,120
Adi.

933
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:46,960
I'm very happy

934
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,800
that you have agreed to undergo surgery.

935
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:51,920
But...

936
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,520
I still believe that

937
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,040
Sam is not the...

938
01:07:58,520 --> 01:07:59,880
Adi, listen.

939
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,360
There's still time. Think about it.

940
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,640
Sam is not the right man
to conduct the surgery.

941
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:09,040
Dr Trehan should be doing it.

942
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,400
He's the best.

943
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,640
Okay?

944
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,240
God bless you.

945
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,400
I have decided already, mom.

946
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,720
Okay?

947
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,760
I'll see you soon. Okay.

948
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,200
I love you, mom.
- I love you too.

949
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,400
Bye.

950
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,080
Okay.

951
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,080
It's time to say good
bye to each other.

952
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,680
Only two minutes.

953
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,200
Thank you, Sam.
- Anytime.

954
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:20,720
You know what?

955
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,960
We'll start afresh
once you are out of the hospital.

956
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,560
Ria.
- Yes?

957
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:31,440
Will my new heart love you as much as

958
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:33,960
this one does?

959
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,040
Yes.
- I love you.

960
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,440
I love you too.

961
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,760
Okay, love birds, time up.

962
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,880
Can we get some more time?
- No.

963
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,080
Love you.

964
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,040
See you soon, my dear wife.

965
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:01,880
Say that again.

966
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,880
See you soon, my dear wife.

967
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:08,240
I think you should leave.
There is nothing you can really do.

968
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,840
Sure?
- Yes.

969
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:14,600
Call me if you need anything.
- Okay.

970
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,120
Take care.
- Okay.

971
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,080
You?
- I am Mrs Ria Aditya Singh.

972
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:43,760
When?

973
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,480
What?

974
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,440
When did my son get married?

975
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,120
When?

976
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:56,960
A few days ago.

977
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,120
Hi, guys.

978
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:04,800
I am Dr Gupta.

979
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,440
You can call me Gups.

980
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:09,160
Pleasure meeting you all.

981
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,640
Hello. Oh!

982
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,080
I would have shook your hand,
but you know...

983
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,720
Well, all set?

984
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,200
What's going on, Prakash?
Who is he?

985
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,360
I don't know. Your friend Patkar
is down with laryngitis.

986
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,480
That why he is here.

987
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,440
But I need Patkar.
- Even I want him,

988
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:26,680
but Gupta replaced him.

989
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:29,680
Well, no problem.

990
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,720
The anaesthetist may have changed,

991
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,640
but the operation is the same.
- Yes.

992
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:34,840
Come.

993
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,040
Hi, Dr Gupta. Let me introduce myself.

994
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,640
I am Dr Sameer Saxena.
You can call me Sam. - Hello.

995
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,600
This is Dr Prakash Solanki.
He is Dr Ajit Rathore. - Hello.

996
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:45,240
And this is my theatre assistant,
Jenny D'souza.

997
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:46,600
Hi, Jenny.

998
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,280
So, how's the patient feeling?

999
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,440
I am fine.

1000
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,800
Is everything alright, Sam?

1001
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,400
Just fine, Adi.

1002
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,480
Hey, Jenny.

1003
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,560
I will see you after the break.

1004
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:03,960
Okay.

1005
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,080
So Adi, this is it.

1006
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:10,440
Yeah.

1007
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,960
When you regain consciousness,

1008
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,920
we will be done with all this.

1009
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,480
I hope so.

1010
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:16,720
See you soon.

1011
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,400
See you soon, Sam.

1012
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,520
Dr Gupta.
- Yes?

1013
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,440
He is my friend. Be careful. Okay?

1014
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:25,720
Okay.

1015
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,560
Increase the supply of oxygen.
- Yes, doctor.

1016
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:36,920
Well.

1017
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:41,200
They must have asked you what you
have eaten in the past four hours.

1018
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,680
Yes.

1019
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,040
You must have received
general anaesthesia previously.

1020
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,400
Am I right?
- Yes.

1021
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,240
I read your pre-operative assessment

1022
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,240
and have made a special recipe for you.

1023
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:52,680
It's a cocktail.

1024
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,600
I am sure,

1025
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:57,080
you are going to like it.

1026
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,040
Here we go.

1027
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,160
Start counting backwards from ten.

1028
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,400
I can't.
- What?

1029
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,400
At school I learned to count straight.

1030
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,840
I am just kidding. I am so scared.

1031
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:15,200
Okay, relax. You will be fine.

1032
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:16,720
Here we go.

1033
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:19,560
Ten.

1034
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,480
Nine.

1035
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:24,760
Eight.

1036
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,640
Seven.

1037
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:29,880
Six.

1038
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,840
Five.

1039
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:39,480
Happy journey, my friend.

1040
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,440
Let yourself go.

1041
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,880
Okay. Let's get going.

1042
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,320
Hey, Gups, what did you give him?

1043
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,200
Midazolam, fentanyl,

1044
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,800
and a bit of vecuronium chaser.

1045
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,400
'God!'

1046
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,360
'Will the surgery leave a scar?'

1047
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:22,080
'Use some shaving cream, at least.'

1048
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,320
'Ew! What is that smell?'

1049
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,120
'But how do I know all this?'

1050
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,200
'I should be unconscious, right?'

1051
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,216
'I don't know how much time it takes
for an anaesthetic to take effect.'

1052
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:41,280
All okay, Gupta?

1053
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,040
He is sleeping like a log.
- 'Yeah, right!'

1054
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,080
Shall we begin?
- 'Wait a minute.'

1055
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:47,960
'Are you starting the operation?'

1056
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,720
'I should be unconscious, right?'

1057
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,760
'Why do I hear everyone's voices?'

1058
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,880
Ready, guys?
- 'How am I feeling all this?'

1059
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,680
'Sam, something is wrong!'

1060
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,640
'I think the anaesthesia
didn't work on me!'

1061
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:59,120
Alright, get the drips on.
- 'Guys!'

1062
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,520
'Hello! Something is not right!'

1063
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,400
'No, Sam!'

1064
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,560
Check on that monitor.
- 'I can hear everything.'

1065
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,640
'I am not unconscious, Sam!'

1066
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:10,240
'I am in my senses!'

1067
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,400
Okay, Gupta.
- 'Stop this!'

1068
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:13,760
'Someone please take a look!'

1069
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,040
'Take a look at the machines!'

1070
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:17,240
'Look at the bloody monitor, Sam!'

1071
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,200
Scalpel.
- 'Stop, Sam!'

1072
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,720
'Oh God! No!'

1073
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,280
'Please, stop it!'

1074
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,720
Do we have blood?
- 'Open your eyes, Adi!'

1075
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,440
'No, Sam!'

1076
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:31,080
'I'm in a lot of pain!'

1077
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,200
'Stop it, Sam!'

1078
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,800
'The pain is unbearable! Sam, please!'

1079
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,400
Make sure the scalpel is
sharper next time. - 'Sam!'

1080
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:48,720
'Please.'

1081
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,320
Saw.
- 'Please, Sam!'

1082
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,720
'Don't do this!'
- Okay.

1083
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,360
'Sam!'

1084
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,120
'No, Sam!'

1085
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,200
'Sam, please stop it!'

1086
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:05,000
'I can't bear this anymore!'

1087
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,400
'Sam!'

1088
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,176
'Think of something else
to forget the pain, Adi!'

1089
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,896
Drips go uniform there.
- 'Think about something else!'

1090
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,880
Prakash get ready to clamp.
- 'Distract yourself!'

1091
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,200
'Think about Ria!'

1092
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:17,360
'Ria!'

1093
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:19,600
'Help me!'

1094
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,800
'Ria, please save me!'

1095
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:24,560
'Ria! That's it!'

1096
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,440
'Ria!'

1097
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,320
'Focus on Ria, Adi.'

1098
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,720
'The memories of Ria!'

1099
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,680
'Think about Ria!'

1100
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:39,040
'Ria!'

1101
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,200
'Focus.'

1102
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:43,920
'No! Not this!'

1103
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:48,560
'Shit! What? No!'

1104
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,120
'No! Not this, Adi!'

1105
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:55,120
'Think about something else.
- I've a lot to do at the office.'

1106
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,601
'And if I don't work, your dad's dream
won't be fulfilled'

1107
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:59,400
'and this business
will be shut down.'

1108
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:02,080
'No, Adi, you can't play football.'

1109
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:03,640
'Stop it.'

1110
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,160
'You snatch everything.
You take away all the things I like.'

1111
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:07,160
'I hate you!'

1112
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:09,320
'At least agree to go for
a heart transplant.'

1113
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:10,880
'No.
- You owe it to yourself.'

1114
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,600
'No. I told you once.'

1115
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:14,760
'That's it.
- Help me!'

1116
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
'Sam!'

1117
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,920
'What's the patient's name?
- Aditya Singh.'

1118
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,120
'He is experiencing
severe chest pain and heaviness.'

1119
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:22,800
'And he is hemodynamically unstable.'

1120
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,296
'A possible myocardial infarction.'

1121
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,880
'Sam, you saved me
the first time I had an attack.'

1122
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:29,200
'Sam, please do something.'

1123
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,280
'Don't worry, Aditya,
everything will be alright.'

1124
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,360
'Stay with me, pal.'

1125
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:35,200
'Stay with me.'
- Wait.

1126
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,440
Open it nice and well.

1127
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,520
'What the hell! The same pain again.'

1128
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,400
'Don't worry, Adi. You will be fine.'
- That's it.

1129
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:43,840
'You can control it
like you did earlier.'

1130
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,320
'You can do it!'

1131
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,800
Another bone broke.
- He'll be in a lot of pain tomorrow.

1132
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:49,600
Sorry, Adi.

1133
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,320
'Yes, you better be sorry, Sam!'

1134
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:55,680
'The pain won't last long, Adi.'

1135
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:57,600
'We are nearly through.'

1136
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,840
'Sam will fix all this'

1137
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,600
'like he did in the past.'

1138
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:04,960
'Stay with me, pal.
Everything is going to be okay.'

1139
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,160
'I always follow up on my patients.'

1140
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,800
'Especially when I've saved
someone's life. Have a seat.'

1141
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:12,680
'You can thank me.'

1142
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,400
'This is the right time.'

1143
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,320
'How do I thank you?'

1144
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,360
'Well, I prefer cash.'

1145
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,920
'Sam, take me to Ria.'

1146
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:24,800
'Adi, you've a rare heart disease
called EMF.'

1147
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,160
'You need a heart transplant.'

1148
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,056
'Which is fibrosis of heart...
- What are you thinking?'

1149
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,600
'Unfortunately, there's no cure'

1150
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,440
'except a heart transplant.'

1151
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,440
'I love going for the big catch.'

1152
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:37,240
'Do you go fishing? That means you
only like being a millionaire.'

1153
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,680
'You like to eat the fish others
work hard to catch.'

1154
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,680
'Am I right? He is my dad.'

1155
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,840
'She is my mom. Isn't it weird'

1156
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,280
'that a person's entire life'

1157
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,400
'can be summed up on
a small part of a wall?'

1158
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:50,440
'I hope my life'

1159
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,080
'fills the entire wall, at least.'

1160
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:57,440
'Oh God!'

1161
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:00,240
'I miss you, Ria.
- Is this okay?'

1162
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,320
'I love you so much.'

1163
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,920
'I love you and I miss you.'

1164
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,680
'Ria, help me get rid of this pain.'

1165
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,360
'Miss you.'

1166
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:13,080
'Look at me, Ria. Just look at me.'

1167
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,320
'This operation will over soon, Ria.'

1168
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,640
'Very soon, I will be with you.'

1169
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:22,960
'Just pray for me.'

1170
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:24,960
'Ria's memories'

1171
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:28,440
'from the beginning.
- You're rich, handsome, '

1172
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,960
'and honest.'

1173
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:31,560
'Wow!'

1174
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,200
'How is it your fault'

1175
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,480
'that you were born in a rich family?'

1176
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:39,440
'Now it's your turn.'

1177
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,560
'Stay with me. Just stay with me'

1178
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,440
'We are almost there, Ria.'

1179
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,640
'Almost there.'
- The new heart is here, doctor.

1180
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:48,280
It's a beautiful heart.

1181
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:50,280
You're very fortunate.

1182
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:53,000
By the way, I have two tickets
of the IPL game.

1183
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,240
Jenny, care to join me?

1184
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:56,880
No, thanks.

1185
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,840
I don't like cricket.
- What!

1186
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,400
Why?

1187
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:01,960
Hey, Sam.

1188
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,320
Will you come with me?

1189
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,640
I hate cricket.

1190
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,440
What's your problem?

1191
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:12,080
Oh God! Adi's medicines.

1192
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,800
I carry them with me.

1193
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:18,720
Otherwise, he takes them every
half hour like chocolates.

1194
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,480
He could overdose, you know.

1195
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,280
Thank God! He won't need them anymore.

1196
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,840
You care a lot about him, don't you?

1197
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,560
Nice.

1198
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,160
I tried to find reasons

1199
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,240
to not like him,

1200
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,000
to go far away from him.

1201
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,560
Honestly,

1202
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,840
I know how important he is to you.

1203
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,800
What do you want, Ria?

1204
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:49,960
I just want him to be happy.

1205
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:55,320
And it's linked to your happiness.

1206
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,560
He has already lost his dad.

1207
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:03,000
I don't want him to lose you too.

1208
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,920
It's not wrong to love someone,
Mrs Singh.

1209
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,040
And I am not bad.

1210
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:14,880
Please.

1211
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:17,520
Please.

1212
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:22,240
There are some more pills besides these.
- What?

1213
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:25,800
He has some allergies,
especially during summer.

1214
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,840
It's okay.

1215
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,760
Alright.

1216
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,520
Aditya Singh's family?
- Yes.

1217
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,200
Ma'am, his operation has started.

1218
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,880
The two of you should go to
the waiting room on the second floor.

1219
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:43,960
Okay.

1220
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:45,240
He is sleeping comfortably.

1221
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,560
Dr Gupta, you've been working
for a long time.

1222
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:48,800
Why don't you take a break?

1223
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:51,920
Go and have a cup of coffee.
- Oh! That's a good idea.

1224
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,720
I need to make a call.
- No problem.

1225
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,040
We won't need you for half an hour.

1226
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,800
Thanks.

1227
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,560
I will join you soon.

1228
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,320
Sam, what happened? Are you alright?

1229
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:14,800
I can't do it.

1230
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:16,480
But what's the problem?

1231
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:18,560
Patkar.
- Okay.

1232
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:19,920
He messed it up.

1233
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,600
And this new guy, Gupta,

1234
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:23,360
he is keeping an eye on us.

1235
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,800
Oh, come on, Sam. Gupta is an idiot.

1236
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,560
He doesn't know what's happening here.

1237
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:28,880
No.

1238
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:30,840
I think he is spying on us.

1239
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,560
I think he knows everything.

1240
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,920
We kept lowering Adi's position on
the list. - 'What!'

1241
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,920
Have you ever stood near Gupta?

1242
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,280
He's not a spy. He's an alcoholic.

1243
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:41,920
He has a bad hangover.

1244
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,400
Hey! Lower your voice.
He will be here soon.

1245
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,360
Jenny, go and stand guard outside.

1246
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:50,040
And try to find out what
happened to Patkar.

1247
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:53,040
Sam, you're just getting paranoid.
Nobody will come to know anything.

1248
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:56,320
I have planned all this.

1249
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,680
And my instructions will be
followed to the letter.

1250
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:00,440
I don't want to go to jail.

1251
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,640
'Jail! What are you
talking about, Sam?'

1252
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,840
Nobody is going to jail. Inject
the new heart and put it back inside.

1253
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,600
That's all.
- 'What the hell is going on?'

1254
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:10,520
Calm down, Sam. Nobody will have a clue.

1255
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,680
Let's finish all this in an hour

1256
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:13,960
and then have a few drinks.

1257
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:16,000
He will be dead by the time
Gupta returns.

1258
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:17,400
'I'll be dead!'

1259
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,080
'Oh my God, Adi!'

1260
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,000
I don't know why I get a feeling
that Gupta is watching us.

1261
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:23,640
Come on, Sam.
- Come on, Sam.

1262
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:26,440
'Mom! Ria! Save me!'

1263
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,520
I am very tense.

1264
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,760
Why are they taking so much time?

1265
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,160
I'll go and check.
- I'll come with you.

1266
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,880
No, you stay here.

1267
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:43,640
Okay, darling, love you.

1268
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,440
Hey!

1269
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,200
Sam!

1270
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,400
Sam, why do you want to kill me?

1271
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:51,960
Why?

1272
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:53,360
I am warning you, guys.

1273
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,480
If he gets suspicious,

1274
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:59,480
I'll cancel the plan immediately.
I swear, I am not kidding.

1275
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,000
Come off it, Sam.

1276
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,080
Excuse me.
- Yes?

1277
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,400
Do you know what's the status
of the operation?

1278
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,080
The heart transplant.

1279
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,800
Aditya Singh?
- Yes.

1280
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,680
Oh, he is doing fine.
Everything is going as planned.

1281
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:17,360
Is it?

1282
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:19,040
Yes, I am coming from there.

1283
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:21,880
Any problem?

1284
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,880
But you don't seem to be a doctor here.

1285
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:28,320
I mean you don't work at this hospital.

1286
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,320
Oh! I am Dr Shashank Gupta.

1287
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,920
I am Aditya's anaesthetist.
Pleasure meeting you.

1288
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:36,160
Just excuse me.

1289
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:38,920
Patkar is down with laryngitis

1290
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,440
that's why I replaced him.
I'm from St Mary's hospital. - Oh!

1291
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:42,600
Ria.

1292
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:45,560
Ria!

1293
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:48,280
Ria.

1294
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,680
Ria, save me please. Listen to me.

1295
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:52,360
They want to kill me.

1296
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,040
Sam is not my friend. Ria, listen to me.

1297
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:59,320
Oh! No, everything is fine.

1298
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,480
Give her a kiss from my side.

1299
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,240
And tell him I will be home soon.

1300
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,160
Ria, ask them.
- What's going on here?

1301
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:13,360
Why is it taking so much time?

1302
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:17,000
What did I do?

1303
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:20,000
What harm had Ria caused you?
Why are you doing this?

1304
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,920
Ria, what are you doing here? You
shouldn't be in the operation theatre.

1305
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,720
I just came here to see
what's happening.

1306
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:27,400
I was getting worried.

1307
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,480
Is everything okay?
- Yes. Everything is fine.

1308
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,360
Ria, he is lying.

1309
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:35,400
Really? I spoke to some guy named Gupta.

1310
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,840
Our regular anaesthetist Patkar
couldn't make it,

1311
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:40,080
Gupta is his replacement
from St Mary's hospital.

1312
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,760
But you don't have to worry.
Everything is alright.

1313
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:43,960
Don't trust him.

1314
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,280
He is lying. He is trying to kill me.

1315
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:47,880
Are you sure everything is alright?

1316
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,720
But, of course.
Everything is under control.

1317
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,920
Bullshit!
- That's it. Come on, baby. Yes!

1318
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,280
What's going on here?

1319
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,480
Why isn't Patkar here?

1320
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:00,520
I spoke to him. He is at home.

1321
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,680
He is at home?
- Yes.

1322
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:06,400
He backed down.
- Backed down!

1323
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:08,040
What do you mean he backed down?

1324
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,480
Yes, ask him.

1325
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:12,480
Anyway, I hope Gupta
doesn't suspect anything.

1326
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:15,200
No. Not at all.

1327
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:17,120
What about Adi's mom?

1328
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,600
Are you mad? A few minutes ago,
she was in tears and hugging me.

1329
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:23,720
She is under control.
Please get her a gown quickly.

1330
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:27,560
But what about Gupta?
- Don't worry about him.

1331
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:30,000
He is a drunkard. He won't be here
for another half an hour.

1332
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,360
Sam, we need to put him
on bypass quickly.

1333
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,840
Ria, it was my plan.

1334
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,960
I can back out whenever I want.

1335
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,320
Sam, you can't back out.

1336
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:57,960
We have worked on this for a year.

1337
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:00,960
I changed my name and my life.

1338
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,480
It's all clear.

1339
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:04,160
Nothing will happen to us.

1340
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,560
And the toughest part has
already been done.

1341
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,720
He married me.

1342
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,200
'He is Prakash, the second witness.
- Hi.'

1343
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,960
'Are you a doctor too?
- Yes.'

1344
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:18,080
'Sorry, I am late.'

1345
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:19,760
'I was buying a wedding gift for you.'

1346
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:21,400
'I am Jenny.
- Nice to meet you.'

1347
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,496
'They knew each other.
- Nice to meet you too. Congrats.'

1348
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,440
'Jenny.
- Thank you very much.'

1349
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,360
'They were in cahoots
with each other.'

1350
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,280
'What are you thinking?'

1351
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:32,800
'I don't believe this.'

1352
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:40,520
Sam, why did you make this plan?

1353
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,680
You're in debt.

1354
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:46,160
This is the only way
to pay off your debt.

1355
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:57,640
'Sam is my friend, mom.'

1356
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:01,320
'No doctor would care more
for my life than him.'

1357
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:05,480
Ria, I can't kill him.

1358
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,840
Then get ready to die.

1359
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:11,440
Your creditors are not
as amicable as you.

1360
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:13,920
They won't hesitate to kill you.

1361
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,680
You have no option, Sam.

1362
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,240
Just face it.

1363
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:20,160
Ria, it's just money.

1364
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:22,520
He is my friend.

1365
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,200
If I ask him, he will give me the money.

1366
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:28,760
Sam, don't talk nonsense!
- Hey, listen to me.

1367
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:31,240
It was my idea.

1368
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,240
He came to me first.

1369
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:35,720
I got all of you involved.

1370
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:37,520
I sent you to Dubai.

1371
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:39,920
I called her mom here

1372
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,840
so that you can entrap him.

1373
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:47,800
'Yes, tell me. - Hello, Mrs Singh. I am
calling from Parulkar Heart Institute.'

1374
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,440
'We have found a donor.
Can you come here tomorrow?'

1375
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:53,960
'But I am in Dubai and I've a very
important meeting tomorrow morning.'

1376
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,096
'Ma'am, we have found a donor
with great difficulty.'

1377
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:57,760
'You won't get such
an opportunity again.'

1378
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:00,320
Had he died before you get married,
my plan would have failed.

1379
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,040
Absolutely.

1380
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:03,800
Had I been in your place,

1381
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:06,280
I would have married him
before leaving Dubai.

1382
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:07,800
Really?

1383
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:09,936
But it would have happened
only if you hadn't got pregnant

1384
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:11,560
with your boyfriend's child, Jenny.

1385
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:13,120
So just get lost.

1386
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:18,000
Sam, you're getting emotional now.

1387
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:20,960
But you'll need money in a few days.

1388
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:22,960
And you're going to regret this.

1389
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:26,321
You won't earn such a lot even
if you conduct surgeries all your life.

1390
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:28,800
We stand to get millions.

1391
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,400
Even after distributing the
amount equally between

1392
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:33,640
the five of us, you will
have more than enough.

1393
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:36,800
Besides, it's a case of transplant.

1394
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:40,560
Such patients die within a few years.

1395
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:45,880
You're right.

1396
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,360
Such patients die within a few years.

1397
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:08,920
No!

1398
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:13,880
No!

1399
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,680
Come on, Sam. Let's move.
Pass the new heart.

1400
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,240
But I haven't injected it.

1401
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:33,440
Then do it, Sam.
We don't have time. Damn it!

1402
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:36,360
Where is the syringe?
- Over there.

1403
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:38,760
Give it to me.
- Ria, what are you doing?

1404
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:41,800
Come on move your bloody hand.

1405
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,480
Sam, take the syringe, inject it,

1406
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:45,920
and put it back in.

1407
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:48,320
Sam, it was your idea.

1408
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:50,840
So finish it what you began.

1409
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:52,920
Just do it, Sam.

1410
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:57,640
He loves you a lot.

1411
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,000
Love!

1412
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:03,520
He doesn't even know me.

1413
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:05,840
We have never met.

1414
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:10,920
Wait. Hold on.

1415
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:13,240
Ria, don't.

1416
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,080
Now, put it in.

1417
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:26,320
Sorry, baby.

1418
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:55,520
Mrs Singh.

1419
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:56,960
Is Adi alright?

1420
01:32:57,320 --> 01:33:00,081
They didn't tell me anything.
- But you were in there for a long time.

1421
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:08,760
Ria,

1422
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:10,720
I am very scared.

1423
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,240
Well, guys, how's everything?

1424
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,360
Everything is fine. Forceps.

1425
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,520
Hey, you guys seem to be in hurry.
- Dr Gupta,

1426
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:20,960
look what's happening with me.

1427
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,640
Dr Gupta, look at me.

1428
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,160
There is something wrong with me!
Look at my eyes!

1429
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:28,960
Please look at my eyes! I am crying!

1430
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,080
Dr Gupta, look at me!

1431
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:34,040
Just a minute. Stop.
- Yes, Dr Gupta.

1432
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:41,840
I can't go to the IPL game tomorrow.

1433
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:44,680
I forgot that I've to take
my wife to dinner tomorrow.

1434
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:46,360
Dr Rathore,

1435
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:47,840
I'll give you both the tickets.

1436
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,520
Take your girlfriend to the game.
She will be very happy.

1437
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:03,880
Something is wrong.

1438
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:06,040
I can feel it.

1439
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:07,960
I can't just sit here doing nothing.

1440
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:10,520
Calm down. Don't worry.

1441
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,680
Everything is going to be fine.

1442
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,800
I can't live without him.

1443
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:22,640
Pressure down.

1444
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:34,720
'She knew where I kept my pills.'

1445
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:37,760
'Do you think I am for sale? Here.'

1446
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:40,560
'She threw away a ring worth 10 dollars
and became a billionaire.'

1447
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,640
'Adi, you're such a fool.'

1448
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:51,440
Ria, I hope you're happy.

1449
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,200
There is something wrong.
He is fibbing.

1450
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:57,640
He is fibbing!

1451
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:59,280
Wait a minute. What do we do, Sam?

1452
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:00,960
Start de-fibrillation.

1453
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:03,720
Make it 60 joules.
- Paddle to 60 joules.

1454
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:08,040
'I can't trust a run-of-the-mill
doctor with your life.'

1455
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:10,720
'He is my friend, mom.
I trust him implicitly.'

1456
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,760
'The problem is that
you don't trust me.'

1457
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,440
'I am so sorry, mom.'

1458
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:34,120
'The number you're calling...'

1459
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,600
'Everything was happening
right in front of me, '

1460
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,360
'but I had no clue.'

1461
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:42,760
'How could I have known?'

1462
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:46,240
'I was busy looking at you.'

1463
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,720
Charge once again.

1464
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:51,080
Paddle charge. Charge released.
- Clear.

1465
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:52,560
Charge.

1466
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:55,200
Clear.
- Give it to me. Let me charge it.

1467
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:57,400
Come on, Adi!

1468
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:00,200
We are losing him.

1469
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:02,240
No, let me give it another try, please.

1470
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:07,080
It's over, Sam.

1471
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:09,240
We need to put him on bypass.

1472
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:11,040
What about adrenaline?

1473
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:12,840
It's pointless.

1474
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:15,400
Let me try one shot of it. Please.

1475
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:16,960
Come on, Adi!

1476
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:19,520
Come on!
- It won't work. It's over.

1477
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:21,360
Are you sure, Dr Gupta, there is no air?

1478
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:22,720
Yes, there is no air.

1479
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:24,800
I can see it.
- Oh, come on, Adi!

1480
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,320
Adi!

1481
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:29,160
I'm sorry, sir.

1482
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,720
It's all my fault.

1483
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:43,120
No, Sam, it's not your fault.

1484
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:44,440
Oh, come on.

1485
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:46,400
I should have done something.

1486
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:48,600
Sam, you did whatever you could.

1487
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:50,960
Oh, really?
- Yes, Sam.

1488
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:54,520
It wasn't the right heart.

1489
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:58,560
We need to inform his family.

1490
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:00,160
Who will tell them?

1491
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:01,760
I will tell them.

1492
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:04,480
I should do this.

1493
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,160
I will come with you.

1494
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:19,960
Sorry, Gayatri.

1495
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:21,880
His body rejected the heart.

1496
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:24,200
We tried a lot,

1497
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:27,000
but the organ failed.

1498
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:29,120
I am so sorry.

1499
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:32,280
The organ failed!

1500
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:34,400
More often than not, in such cases...
- You...

1501
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:36,880
You have failed.

1502
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:41,880
No. We tried our best,

1503
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:44,160
but the procedure...
- Say it.

1504
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:45,840
What?
- Tell me.

1505
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:50,440
I want to hear you say that you failed.

1506
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,600
You couldn't save my son.

1507
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:55,320
I knew you shouldn't have
performed the surgery.

1508
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:57,400
You shouldn't have been here.

1509
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:02,920
Sorry, Mrs Singh.

1510
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:09,200
I knew it.
- Mrs Singh.

1511
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:13,600
So sorry.

1512
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:18,040
Adi, I am so sorry.

1513
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,640
I am so sorry.

1514
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,360
Adi, sorry.
- I am sorry, ma'am,

1515
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:29,320
but we need your permission,

1516
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:32,920
to remove Aditya from the bypass.

1517
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,040
My permission?
- Yes.

1518
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:40,080
We need your signature to
take Aditya off the bypass.

1519
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:45,120
I don't get it.

1520
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:47,960
Is he alive?

1521
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:50,640
Yes, technically.

1522
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:53,120
But a machine is pumping the blood.

1523
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:56,000
He doesn't have a heart.

1524
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:58,520
Then, get another heart.

1525
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:00,600
You don't understand.

1526
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:02,600
His blood group is rare.

1527
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:05,440
It's very difficult to get
another heart at this time.

1528
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:07,320
I am sorry.

1529
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:08,960
It's over.

1530
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,320
No, it's not.

1531
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:16,160
It's not over.

1532
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:19,320
Something can be done.
- Mother.

1533
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:22,560
I want to

1534
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:24,640
stay alone for a while.

1535
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:26,600
Okay.

1536
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:56,760
<i>âª Tell me whether
I am dead or alive. âª</i>

1537
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:05,480
<i>âª Tell me that this is a dream,
not reality. âª</i>

1538
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:14,520
<i>âª Tell me whether
I am dead or alive. âª</i>

1539
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:23,960
<i>âª Tell me that this is a dream,
not reality. âª</i>

1540
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:30,720
<i>âª I trusted you more than myself. âª</i>

1541
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:36,960
<i>âª I considered you my life,
but you betrayed me. âª</i>

1542
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:43,240
<i>âª Did I not love you enough? âª</i>

1543
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:49,720
<i>âª How could you be so heartless? âª</i>

1544
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:55,680
<i>âª How could you kill your love? âª</i>

1545
01:40:55,880 --> 01:41:02,320
<i>âª How could be so heartless?
Kill your love! âª</i>

1546
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:10,400
<i>âª Tell me you're not
who you claim to be. âª</i>

1547
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:21,680
<i>âª Tell me I will live longer. âª</i>

1548
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:28,360
<i>âª If my body is cold,
why does my soul burn? âª</i>

1549
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:34,440
<i>âª I am screaming,
but nobody hears me. âª</i>

1550
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:40,960
<i>âª What pleasure did you get
from my pain? âª</i>

1551
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:46,680
<i>âª How could you be so heartless?
So heartless. âª</i>

1552
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:53,400
<i>âª How could you kill your love?
Kill your love. âª</i>

1553
01:41:53,480 --> 01:42:00,640
<i>âª How could you be so heartless?
So heartless! Kill your love! âª</i>

1554
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:21,120
<i>âª How could you kill your love? âª</i>

1555
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:54,640
<i>âª How could you be so heartless?
How could you kill your love? âª</i>

1556
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:59,920
<i>âª How could you be so heartless?
How could you kill your love? âª</i>

1557
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,200
<i>âª How could you be so heartless? âª</i>

1558
01:43:04,360 --> 01:43:09,800
<i>âª How could you kill your love? âª</i>

1559
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:48,920
Mom, why are you here?

1560
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:51,360
How could I leave you alone?

1561
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:55,320
I left you alone once.

1562
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:57,960
And see what happened.

1563
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:12,680
Mom.

1564
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:16,280
How can we see each other?

1565
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:19,040
How can we hear each other?

1566
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:26,640
Oh my God!

1567
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:28,600
Mom,

1568
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:30,320
what did you do?

1569
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:32,240
How?

1570
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,360
'Gayatri, it's impossible.'

1571
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:38,280
'It's a crazy plan.'

1572
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:40,440
'Do you know what you are saying?'

1573
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:42,360
'I don't...'

1574
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:46,360
I' can't do this.
- Sanjeev.'

1575
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:49,200
'Think like a doctor, '

1576
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,760
'not a friend.'

1577
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:57,320
'I am donating my heart to someone,
who needs it the most.'

1578
01:45:57,480 --> 01:45:59,000
'Gayatri, this is suicide!'

1579
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:00,760
'I won't let you do it!'

1580
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:03,680
'And you know that
even if you commit suicide, '

1581
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:05,840
'I won't perform the surgery.'

1582
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:07,720
'This is a murder!'

1583
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:09,840
'This is not murder.'

1584
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:13,160
'What happened inside
the operation theatre was murder.'

1585
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:16,360
'You have to do this...'

1586
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:18,880
'For me.

1587
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:21,360
'Are you listening? Gayatri!'

1588
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:23,280
'Gayatri!'

1589
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,680
You were right about Ria.

1590
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,040
She betrayed me.

1591
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:38,960
I know.

1592
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:40,960
How did you come to know about Ria?

1593
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:43,080
When Trehan told me over the phone

1594
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:44,680
that he had seen Ria somewhere...

1595
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:49,320
'You...'
- He had seen Ria in Abu Dhabi with Sam

1596
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:51,440
at a medical convention.

1597
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:53,480
She was a member of his team.

1598
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:55,800
And then,

1599
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:58,880
when your medicines fell from her bag,

1600
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:00,920
I became more suspicious.

1601
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:03,720
Ria did everything cleverly.

1602
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:06,080
But she made one mistake.

1603
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:08,520
She left her bag with me.

1604
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,440
'And when I opened her bag, '

1605
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:14,000
'I found her correspondence
with the medical college'

1606
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:15,680
'where she was a junior doctor.'

1607
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:18,240
'I also found some credit cards'

1608
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:20,440
'in the name of Shruti Tandon.'

1609
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:22,800
I feel so bad.

1610
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:25,240
I always considered Dr Trehan wrong.

1611
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,040
Gayatri!

1612
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:35,320
Gayatri!

1613
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,480
Oh God!

1614
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:41,320
Prepare for the operation!

1615
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:43,560
Send me the stretcher immediately!
- Yes, sir.

1616
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:51,200
Dr Trehan,

1617
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:54,520
I tried hard to save him, but...

1618
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:56,840
I know how hard you tried.

1619
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:57,960
Just get out of here.

1620
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:00,280
The police are on their way.
- Come on, guys.

1621
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:03,040
Come on, Sam, let's go.
- Come on, Sam, let's get going.

1622
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:10,000
Come back, Adi.

1623
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:12,400
Please.

1624
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:15,240
I am so sorry.

1625
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:22,960
Dr Sameer Saxena,

1626
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:26,080
it's due to doctors like you

1627
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:28,520
that the entire medical fraternity
is infamous.

1628
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:37,720
'Remove my heart after I die, '

1629
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:39,960
'it belongs to someone else.'

1630
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:42,320
'Make sure it doesn't burn with me.'

1631
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:43,680
Gayatri,

1632
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:46,960
this is the most difficult moment
of my life.

1633
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:51,960
I will never forgive you for this.

1634
01:48:57,880 --> 01:48:59,000
Sam.

1635
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:05,560
Ria, it's all over.

1636
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:08,240
You must leave.

1637
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:10,880
The police will be here any moment now.

1638
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:14,760
Sam, I don't need to go anywhere.

1639
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:17,200
I married him.

1640
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,480
Remember? I am his widow.

1641
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:23,080
I will still get my share.

1642
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:25,440
What!

1643
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:28,120
But he is alive, Ria.

1644
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:30,240
He isn't dead.

1645
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:32,760
If he hasn't died, he will soon.

1646
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:29,760
Excuse me, Mrs Singh.

1647
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:32,440
Just a minute.

1648
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:35,800
Okay. Cut it.

1649
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:38,240
Congratulations, sir.

1650
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:40,040
Well done.
- Great job, sir.

1651
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:40,920
Thank you, sir.

1652
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,360
Well done.

1653
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:45,600
Oh my God!

1654
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:47,160
He is sinking.

1655
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:48,960
Start DE-fibrillation!

1656
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:51,200
Quick!
- Clear.

1657
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:53,600
Not responding.
- Make it 150 joules.

1658
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:55,080
Clear.
- 200 joules.

1659
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:57,840
200 joules!
- 200 joules. Clear.

1660
01:50:58,440 --> 01:50:59,760
It's about time, Adi.

1661
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:03,840
You should go now.

1662
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:07,440
No, mom.

1663
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:10,920
I don't want to go back.

1664
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:15,320
First, I lost dad.

1665
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:18,600
And now I have lost you.

1666
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:22,680
Sam and Ria betrayed me.

1667
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:25,960
No, Adi.

1668
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:27,800
Don't say that.

1669
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,480
Every person has his own journey.

1670
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:36,480
Just being with someone for a while

1671
01:51:37,160 --> 01:51:39,000
doesn't mean you go on the same journey.

1672
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:42,760
Until now we were together.

1673
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:44,320
We were with each other.

1674
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:47,680
But now you need to
embark upon your journey.

1675
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:50,640
That's what life is all about.

1676
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,600
I don't want such a life.

1677
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:00,240
I want to be with you.

1678
01:52:03,240 --> 01:52:04,800
I won't go back.

1679
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:07,440
You don't get it, Adi.

1680
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:10,080
Even if you don't go back,

1681
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,680
you can't be with me.

1682
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:17,040
We were meant to be together
only for so long.

1683
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:20,720
Clear.

1684
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:23,840
No... No response.
- Clear.

1685
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:26,440
I want to show you something.

1686
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:29,760
Adi.
- 'Dad, I want to sail the boat too.'

1687
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:34,400
'I want you to stop blaming yourself'

1688
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:37,240
'for your dad's death.'

1689
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:39,720
'How long will you hold him, Gayatri?'

1690
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:42,320
'Let him live his life.'

1691
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:44,440
'Come, Adi.
- It was an accident.'

1692
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:46,640
'Just an accident.'

1693
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:49,080
'Come my brave-heart. Sit here.
- It was not your fault.'

1694
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:50,720
'Now you're the captain of the boat.'

1695
01:52:51,480 --> 01:52:52,480
'Do what you want.'

1696
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:55,040
'Vikram, don't make him sit
so close to the bow. I am scared.'

1697
01:52:55,120 --> 01:52:56,400
'Relax, Gayatri.'

1698
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:00,960
'No, it's too fast.
- He will be fine.'

1699
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:02,720
'Adi!'

1700
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:04,520
'Dad, save me!
- Adi!'

1701
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:07,920
'Dad, help me!
- Adi!'

1702
01:53:08,160 --> 01:53:09,680
'Adi!'

1703
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:12,600
'Adi!
- Help me.'

1704
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:14,280
'Vikram, save him!'

1705
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:19,760
'Dad, I am drowning! Save me!'

1706
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:23,720
'Vikram!'

1707
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:28,280
'Hold him!'

1708
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:30,200
'Adi, go.
Adi, come on! Come up!'

1709
01:53:34,840 --> 01:53:36,680
'Vikram!
- Gayatri!'

1710
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:39,560
'No!
- Gayatri!'

1711
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:42,800
'Dad!
- Vikram!'

1712
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:51,040
'I am sorry, dad. Please forgive me.'

1713
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:52,640
'I am responsible for this.'

1714
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:55,760
Your dad sacrificed his life
to save you.

1715
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:58,160
You need to go back, Adi.

1716
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:02,160
Every mother give birth
to her child once,

1717
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:05,800
but I am the most fortunate of all,

1718
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:10,200
for getting a chance
to give birth to you once again.

1719
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:14,040
Don't take this away from me.

1720
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:17,920
You've to go back.

1721
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:26,600
'I still remember the vent
in that small room'

1722
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:30,520
'from where the moonlight used to
filter into the room.'

1723
01:54:32,680 --> 01:54:35,040
'I used to sleep on mom's lap, '

1724
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:39,600
'when she would sing a lullaby.'
- My son.

1725
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:43,120
'I lost that childhood somewhere'

1726
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:45,600
'when I grew up.'

1727
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:48,880
'Today, I feel a lump in my throat'

1728
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:52,080
'when I recall those moments.'

1729
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:56,360
'Tears roll down my eyes as I wonder
why mom doesn't scold me anymore.'

1730
01:54:58,120 --> 01:54:59,560
'Have your food on time.'

1731
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:02,200
'Come home early.'

1732
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:04,920
'Why doesn't she say that?'

1733
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:08,080
'Where am I?'

1734
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:10,640
'Why did I go away from mom?'

1735
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:14,360
'Why do I feel so helpless?'

1736
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:17,600
'Today, my sorrow knows no bounds.'

1737
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:21,360
'The small wound has become incurable.'

1738
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:25,400
'I will fall asleep recalling
her stories, '

1739
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:29,560
'and her loving pats on my head.'

1740
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:32,640
'It seems as if'

1741
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:35,040
'mom will come to me.'

1742
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:37,560
'She will embrace me.'

1743
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:41,160
'And she will take me
to the world of angels.'

1744
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:44,120
'Where there will be a king.'

1745
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:46,480
'And a queen.'

1746
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:49,440
'A a new story will end.'

1747
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:53,800
'Mom will go back quietly.'

1748
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:56,760
'I know'

1749
01:55:58,280 --> 01:56:00,040
'mom won't come back.'

1750
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:45,040
Congratulations, Adi.

1751
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:48,480
Welcome back.

1752
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:08,840
Adi!

1753
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:11,480
Adi!

1754
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:15,920
Adi, my sweetheart.

1755
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:19,400
Thank God you are here.

1756
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:21,520
I was so worried for you.

1757
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:25,240
As soon as I got the news of
your discharge from the hospital,

1758
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:26,720
I went to your house.

1759
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:28,960
But I got to know that you're here.

1760
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:32,360
I missed you so much.

1761
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:41,840
I heard about mother.

1762
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:44,560
I am so sorry.

1763
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:48,400
She was very happy for us.

1764
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:54,040
We became quite close
when we were in the hospital.

1765
01:57:55,240 --> 01:57:56,480
I miss her.

1766
01:57:57,080 --> 01:57:59,760
Had she been here,
she wouldn't have let them arrest me.

1767
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:01,280
Can you imagine?

1768
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:03,000
Sam did all that.

1769
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:06,400
I mean, he was so close to you.
He was your friend.

1770
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:08,320
How could he?

1771
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:11,000
And now he refuses to
cooperate with the police.

1772
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:13,840
They arrested me too because of him.

1773
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:15,800
But they didn't have evidence.

1774
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:20,040
Thanks to the Governor
who stood surety for me,

1775
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,640
otherwise I wouldn't have got bail.

1776
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:26,000
Now that you have recovered,

1777
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:27,960
everything will be fine.

1778
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:32,560
Everything will be okay, right?

1779
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:38,880
Adi, I hope

1780
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:41,080
you don't think I was involved...

1781
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:46,040
Of course not.

1782
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:49,960
Ria, I know everything.

1783
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:53,000
I heard everything
in the operation theatre.

1784
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:55,080
I seemed to be unconscious,

1785
01:58:56,360 --> 01:58:57,800
but I was wide awake.

1786
01:58:59,120 --> 01:59:00,320
Anaesthesia Awareness.

1787
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:02,640
You would know about it.

1788
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:05,040
After all, you were a doctor

1789
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:06,600
on Sam's team.

1790
01:59:11,160 --> 01:59:13,200
What do you know?

1791
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:14,400
You don't know anything.

1792
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:16,200
People like you don't
know the difference

1793
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:17,880
between staying alive and living it up.

1794
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:20,280
You didn't even want to live.

1795
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:22,120
I taught you how to live.

1796
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:23,640
Adi, you were dead.

1797
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:26,560
I only tried to kill someone
who was already dead.

1798
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:29,680
Besides, what proof do you have?

1799
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:31,840
Who will believe you?

1800
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:33,680
People think you were unconscious.

1801
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:38,960
'There are some crimes
that cannot be pardoned.'

1802
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:42,520
'I have got the punishment I deserved.'

1803
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:45,920
'I could have got Ria punished as well, '

1804
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:48,960
'but I want you to do it.'

1805
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:51,040
'I am sending you the proof.'

1806
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:54,240
'Forgive me if you can. Sam.'

1807
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:10,040
Adi, please don't send me back to jail.

1808
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:12,520
Adi, you love me. Please.

1809
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:14,360
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

1810
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:17,240
Ria, I would have forgiven you,

1811
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:20,160
but you destroyed the heart

1812
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:22,560
that was in love with you.

1813
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:26,000
And I have my mom's heart now.

1814
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:28,400
Think about it.

1815
02:00:29,480 --> 02:00:31,240
Can my mom ever forgive you?

1816
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:42,480
Adi! Please!

1817
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:45,240
Leave me.

1818
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:47,600
Adi, forgive me.

00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,721
She doesn't know that you forgot,
You still have time,

9
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,020
Plan something special,

10
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,357
What should I do?

11
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,207
You know I have been divorced twice,

12
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,874
Past 3 months I have gone on
three dates,

13
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,482
And do you think I am kind of
special plan man,

14
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:56,118
You know what kind of girl she is?

15
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,386
Which kind of friend you are,
Give me some idea!

16
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,701
You know that I...

17
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:03,080
sing happy birthday out of tune,
I don't know how to play guitar,

18
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,116
Why you are not having
organic vegetables,

19
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,199
I don't have enough time to
learn guitar,

20
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:47,084
How are you?
We all are fine what about you?

21
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,582
Next time I will give you neklace,
This deal must take place,

22
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,817
It must be very expensive,
So?

23
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,030
Since when you are doing this?

24
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,417
You are laughung alot,

25
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,266
What aunt said wrong?

26
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,296
Why don't you get married?

27
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:06,934
May I tell you the truth?

28
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,503
Bell didn't ring yet,

29
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,476
What do you mean?

30
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,244
She is pretty, smart and intelligent,

31
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,014
And I guess she is successful too,

32
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,155
Actually she is much successful
than you but anyway.

33
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,474
Like you and nandini,

34
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,113
Tired, Regular and stuck in
a routine,

35
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,861
Because you always did everything
different,

36
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,097
Because your priorities were different,

37
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,766
It was my marriage and I
was there,

38
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,843
She ditched you,

39
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,815
I mean you ditched her,

40
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,466
Who cares who ditched who?

41
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,366
Sometimes I almost forgot,

42
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:52,370
That energy, fun and those
college days,

43
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,781
I don't know I will feel it ever again,

44
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,724
Your bell will be ring.
When?

45
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,669
Why don't you talk to Radhika?

46
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:22,865
Talking to Radhika,

47
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:31,940
We don't talk to Radhika but we
listen Radhika,

48
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,948
And discussion about this matter.

49
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,287
If she will kill me then?

50
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,760
Since when power failure has
started in Mumbai,

51
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:55,130
If my ice creams will melt down,
You will die if they will melt down,

52
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,316
Why don't you talk to Kunal?
He is appologizing since long,

53
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,190
But what he has done?

54
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:20,892
You are angry about one sms,

55
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,363
I ain't do nothing because I
have already read his sms,

56
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,837
Otherwise who knows what
he would have done,

57
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,399
How much time sms takes to
become a mms,

58
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:33,772
But it didn't made yet,

59
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,812
It's the biggest problem of
our generation,

60
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,188
Who Radhika?

61
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,123
Everyone is screwed up.
And you know that,

62
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:59,500
Throw it then,
You will die to keep smoking it,

63
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,404
People says that time makes
everything fine,

64
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,508
Who know you will also
forgive him,

65
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:45,873
And till then you have ice creams,
Keep eating them,

66
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,516
Ice creams have many flavours,

67
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,357
You are learning guitar,

68
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,959
I have brought it for Dhruv but I
think I will have to learn it,

69
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,170
And we dream about to spend our
entire life with them,

70
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,610
Guithari is getting married,

71
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:20,641
She is very happy,

72
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,055
Are you going?
Ofcourse! You should also come,

73
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,726
I have heard we can find nice guys
in weddings,

74
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,334
You know I have lot of work,

75
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:44,206
So you really won't come,
You will really miss me,

76
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,273
I will sort it out,

77
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,319
Actually I am thinking I am putting
lot of pressure on you,

78
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:01,749
You are so honest and hard working,

79
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,491
And I am such a selfish man,

80
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,433
I don't want to interefere in yourjob,

81
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:29,747
What happen?

82
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,905
How did you find out?

83
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,881
Arjun told me that you will
travel with us,

84
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:35,419
Since that time I am asking this
question to every single girl.

85
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,122
Bus didn't come yet,
Bus has already come,

86
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,994
Guests are also arrived,

87
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:45,890
We all were waiting for you,

88
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:59,238
What's the worth if you will miss
Maayun and Music party,

89
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,167
I will be right back,
Sure!

90
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,444
Now we have nice interraction,

91
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,121
We have spend lot of time together,

92
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,956
You always crack these kind
ofjokes,

93
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,794
Sure! Why?

94
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,789
I have to crack some other
kind ofjokes,

95
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:58,666
What kind of?

96
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,905
People actually laugh on those jokes,
that kind ofjokes you should crack,

97
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,352
I think engine is getting hot,
We will put some water,

98
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:11,031
We have to arrange many other thing in
Dance party except alcohol,

99
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,070
for entertainment value,

100
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:20,806
You looks decent from outside but
you are such a devil.

101
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:34,530
Here on house?

102
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,225
Do something about him,
Forget it, talk to me,

103
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,103
Guys and girls side are old fashion,

104
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,743
Guys side always performs better,

105
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,910
You won't resist a second in
our presence,

106
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,743
Absolutely! Try it,

107
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:57,348
Some other day,

108
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,798
They are getting married and their
performance is the main,

109
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:22,702
I think we should order more Vodka they
are making the sequel of Indian movie,

110
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,195
You have come so early,
Ony day late,

111
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:49,170
You are getting married so early,
She is waiting for you since long,

112
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:52,704
Anyway you know I like weddings,

113
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:03,579
Everyone knows you don't want to get
married and nothing wil happen here,

114
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,685
He needs more time to prepare himself,

115
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:40,757
Like my younger sister,

116
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:45,428
You teach urdu in University,
Yes!

117
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:46,995
I have heard alot about you,
Shall we go?

118
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:01,904
I think you don't like guests,

119
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:11,183
Actuallt after so long everyone is
gathering so my excitement has increased,

120
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:19,830
You are not performing in Sangeet
along with us,

121
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,060
Dance is the good thing,

122
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,033
Nobody asked me for it,

123
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:30,370
Funda is very simple,
All of you will come here,

124
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,236
You will get a chit from this bowl.

125
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:41,276
Whose number will be match they
will ba dance partners,

126
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,066
I need a good partner,

127
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,705
All of you open yours chits and tell
me your number one by one,

128
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:36,432
It means you are 3.
Correct! I am 3.

129
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:41,807
I am 3,

130
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:51,147
It means you are 3,

131
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:01,097
Let's rehearsals,
We will start tomorrow morning,

132
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,308
You and Guithari are friends?
Since when?

133
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:06,829
I live in Mumbai,

134
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:31,852
My papa was punjabi,

135
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:43,722
Today is the practice?

136
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:14,397
Usually people reply for hi,

137
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:38,515
You wear Jasmine Perfume,

138
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:04,740
You are the real brother of Arjun,

139
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,410
Then Sheela is Arjun's Aunt,

140
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,614
Why you keep calling her Aunt,

141
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,819
Would you like if everyone will
call you uncle,

142
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,591
If my age will be close to 40 then...

143
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:34,708
Anything could happen in 2 years,

144
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:39,408
And you were dancing like a
single butterfly.

145
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:43,874
I would like to say something
for Guithari,

146
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:50,886
When I was in 7 standard I came to
my granny's house,

147
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,622
so I saw guithari for the first time,

148
00:39:53,257 --> 00:40:00,425
She was trying to steal oce cream
from that compound,

149
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:05,165
She couldn't steal the ice cream,

150
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,501
But she must stole my heart.

151
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:27,681
He is coming tomorrow,

152
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:39,635
I thought he will come in wedding,

153
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,903
Now he can see your world
class performance,

154
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,281
I couldn't sleep all night long,

155
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,580
You will sleep and your performance
will be done as well.

156
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:43,021
Jai! But what are you...

157
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:48,632
What are you doing here?
I am walking in the house,

158
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:53,042
But in blanket like thieves,
I am feeling cold,

159
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:55,435
What are you doing here?

160
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:58,144
I came here to drink water,
Have you finished?

161
00:51:58,548 --> 00:51:59,606
Now go to sleep,

162
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:01,946
My thirst is over,

163
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:13,822
Can't you talk without shouting,

164
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:18,062
If you won't tell me that what
are you doing here,

165
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:21,261
then I will shout like crazy women
and awake all the family members,

166
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:22,462
Tell her...

167
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,403
Where is guithari?

168
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:31,379
Where we are going?

169
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:37,383
If you will ask one more question,

170
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,516
then assume it will be for you,

171
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,522
I can hear your voices here,

172
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:26,361
I am really enjoying in this
house arrest,

173
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:37,202
Put these yellow and white flowers
on that wall,

174
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,338
Where are you going?
Dhruv is coming,

175
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:52,446
Leave her,
we have to finalize the flowers,

176
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,050
Flowers and me?

177
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:02,959
All ladies are finalzing jewellery now
we have to manage it all,

178
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:06,299
Make it fast,
Alok will kill me,

179
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:59,984
You have missed the entire performance,
No! I saw the last part,

180
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:05,457
Meet everyone,

181
01:06:22,178 --> 01:06:23,076
You dance well,

182
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:28,373
Well if you would be here,

183
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:30,583
After all you will have to become
Naina's partner,

184
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:33,846
I can't do it all.

185
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:05,437
Lifre is so unpredictable.

186
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:14,049
I don't believe that she is...

187
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:20,092
I think...

188
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:23,697
Whatever Arjun's family will decide,

189
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:35,841
For Arjun,

190
01:08:49,391 --> 01:08:50,483
You should eat something,

191
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:57,529
I will bring something for you,

192
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:09,177
How is Guithari?

193
01:09:12,548 --> 01:09:13,810
I will go and meet her,

194
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,010
Where is Dhruv?
He is gone to take shower,

195
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,854
Tomorrow morning at 6,

196
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:27,527
Can you meet me?

197
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:10,929
I have problem to wake up
in the morning,

198
01:10:13,008 --> 01:10:15,340
I sleep 10 more minutes to save
5 minutes,

199
01:10:22,084 --> 01:10:23,142
What's the matter?

200
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:26,547
I want to tell you something,

201
01:10:31,827 --> 01:10:34,295
What?
After BG's death...

202
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:44,134
Whatever it is
it is now,

203
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:46,600
It's a chance,

204
01:10:51,513 --> 01:10:54,573
And we can't deny the truth to
delay this wedding,

205
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:04,384
Now he should understand it,

206
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:17,096
What happen?
Why did you call me here?

207
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:22,535
You don't post pone this marriage,

208
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:26,341
Have you gone mad?

209
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,052
Listen to me,

210
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:35,650
B.G. Really wants to post pone
your marriage,

211
01:18:03,392 --> 01:18:04,916
What happen to you?

212
01:18:08,797 --> 01:18:10,628
Cheers for what?

213
01:18:12,134 --> 01:18:15,001
Cheers for that you have started
talking again,

214
01:18:26,348 --> 01:18:28,111
It's really close to kitchen,

215
01:18:46,368 --> 01:18:47,926
What would you like to have?
Soup?

216
01:18:48,337 --> 01:18:50,635
Order anything,

217
01:18:59,582 --> 01:19:02,176
And I really don't like carrots,
onions and mushrooms,

218
01:19:06,755 --> 01:19:10,384
Why are you so quite? China
Garden is your favourite restaurant,

219
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:16,029
Yes it is my favourite restaurant but
Radhika is already speaking,

220
01:19:18,767 --> 01:19:21,463
Have you got some ideas for
your own wedding,

221
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:54,729
Mode is already ruined,
Do you have another question,

222
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:58,902
Which restaurant is that?

223
01:20:01,076 --> 01:20:03,476
Let's go back to Chandhigarh,
I am really missing the wedding,

224
01:20:03,746 --> 01:20:05,737
I mean what are we doing out here,

225
01:20:07,416 --> 01:20:09,475
Dhruv! Wedding is already over,

226
01:20:10,386 --> 01:20:12,286
But there are many more weddings,

227
01:20:14,323 --> 01:20:18,259
Are you sure you are just missing
wedding or something else.

228
01:20:39,748 --> 01:20:41,943
That Dehli guy's name is Jai,

229
01:20:43,052 --> 01:20:45,577
Enough Ritu?
Why should I enough?

230
01:21:04,139 --> 01:21:05,436
He is not disappeared,

231
01:21:13,849 --> 01:21:16,818
There is nothing like that,
Now wedding is over,

232
01:21:17,152 --> 01:21:21,020
I am back in my normal routine and he
is back to his dehli's routine,

233
01:21:49,752 --> 01:21:52,744
What happen?
You want to quit yourjob again,

234
01:22:12,141 --> 01:22:15,508
You want to get married or you want
to maary me,

235
01:22:15,944 --> 01:22:17,969
I don't understand what kind of
question is that,

236
01:22:18,614 --> 01:22:20,445
It sounds complicated,

237
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:23,045
but it's very simple.

238
01:22:25,721 --> 01:22:27,689
I realised on Arjun's wedding,

239
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:30,520
that we are together but not
with each other,

240
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:35,361
Because our fundas are different,
Think about it,

241
01:22:50,646 --> 01:22:52,204
So what are you trying to say?

242
01:22:53,015 --> 01:22:56,007
Last 2 years what I have invested
in this relationship,

243
01:22:56,485 --> 01:22:57,645
They all are wasted,

244
01:22:57,886 --> 01:23:02,983
To remember your 21 family member's
birthdate and wish them,

245
01:23:03,258 --> 01:23:04,350
they all are wasted,

246
01:23:05,093 --> 01:23:05,422
Tolerating your annoying habbits
they all are wasted,

247
01:23:08,497 --> 01:23:11,523
Jai! Do you realise that you are
ruining my entire plan,

248
01:23:13,669 --> 01:23:16,502
Because I needed my first baby
in two years,

249
01:23:17,606 --> 01:23:19,767
How it will happen?
Relax!

250
01:23:22,778 --> 01:23:24,211
I think this plan is wrong,

251
01:23:25,514 --> 01:23:28,449
Somewhere we have many plans and
less love between us,

252
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:33,817
I think there must be someone
else for us,

253
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:36,749
Who will love us,

254
01:23:41,363 --> 01:23:42,728
Someone else,

255
01:24:00,516 --> 01:24:03,542
But nor I am with her nor she
is crazy in love with me,

256
01:24:05,888 --> 01:24:07,913
She have nothing to do with
our truth,

257
01:24:15,063 --> 01:24:16,030
Have you talk to your mom?

258
01:24:16,765 --> 01:24:19,233
She will kill me,

259
01:24:21,069 --> 01:24:23,503
I was thinking if...

260
01:24:26,108 --> 01:24:27,473
you will talk to her,

261
01:24:44,593 --> 01:24:45,719
I think you are right,

262
01:24:48,931 --> 01:24:50,626
I am kind of a strong woman,

263
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,760
but to hear that...

264
01:24:54,503 --> 01:24:57,472
I thought I would be upset more
than that,

265
01:25:10,519 --> 01:25:12,384
We can be friends,

266
01:25:17,859 --> 01:25:19,258
Give me some time,

267
01:25:35,377 --> 01:25:36,674
Whom you met...

268
01:25:38,914 --> 01:25:40,745
If you ever want to persue her,

269
01:25:42,050 --> 01:25:44,712
so please presue her after reform
your habbits,

270
01:25:46,488 --> 01:25:47,580
That will be good impression,

271
01:26:01,003 --> 01:26:02,527
Special plans for tonight,

272
01:26:03,171 --> 01:26:06,038
Just me and Arundhati and some
coffee,

273
01:26:10,545 --> 01:26:11,512
You are moking with me,

274
01:26:20,288 --> 01:26:22,279
Whom you spend your every night,

275
01:26:23,325 --> 01:26:25,987
Let's change the plans,

276
01:26:49,284 --> 01:26:51,878
You got a nice chance,
you didn't scared,

277
01:26:53,121 --> 01:26:54,145
I was...

278
01:26:54,790 --> 01:26:57,918
but I thought I should accept
the truth,

279
01:26:58,694 --> 01:26:59,786
and that chance...

280
01:27:00,696 --> 01:27:03,460
We take chances to cross the roads,

281
01:27:19,448 --> 01:27:21,211
Now I am not from your community,

282
01:27:24,586 --> 01:27:26,520
We are back,

283
01:27:29,357 --> 01:27:31,086
did you get her number,

284
01:27:37,499 --> 01:27:39,228
When?
What are you doing?

285
01:27:45,907 --> 01:27:48,808
I am thinking I should go for
a cofffee with her,

286
01:28:15,337 --> 01:28:17,328
Please accept my friend's request,

287
01:28:17,606 --> 01:28:20,336
I want to add you in wedding pics,

288
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:28,938
We were together in wedding she
just want to share the pictures,

289
01:28:29,951 --> 01:28:31,885
I was also gone to wedding,

290
01:28:32,387 --> 01:28:35,413
nobody shared anything with me,
Sheela is sharing...

291
01:28:36,091 --> 01:28:36,989
her old age.

292
01:29:02,784 --> 01:29:03,910
Do you like Naina?

293
01:29:06,955 --> 01:29:09,856
Naina is with Dhruv and she lives
in Mumbai,

294
01:29:15,697 --> 01:29:17,597
We have to renew the advertisement
contracts,

295
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:20,564
Last time you cracked the
endorsement deal.

296
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:33,442
Shall we book the plane tickets,

297
01:30:16,625 --> 01:30:18,354
So how come dinner's plan tonight,

298
01:30:32,707 --> 01:30:33,833
I am going to singapore tomorrow,

299
01:30:43,285 --> 01:30:45,310
It means you will miss my
exhibition,

300
01:31:01,670 --> 01:31:05,766
My company says if I will like
that setup,

301
01:31:06,207 --> 01:31:09,438
so I can get Vise President's position,

302
01:31:17,886 --> 01:31:19,183
That's what you wanted,

303
01:31:34,836 --> 01:31:35,928
Will you marry me?

304
01:31:53,254 --> 01:31:54,380
Everything is going so fast,

305
01:31:55,223 --> 01:31:57,714
But opportunities came to
life like this,

306
01:31:59,394 --> 01:32:00,759
I will be back in ten days,

307
01:32:02,297 --> 01:32:03,389
What kind of wedding you want?

308
01:32:04,132 --> 01:32:05,963
Wherever, however you want.

309
01:32:45,106 --> 01:32:49,133
How my super independent daughter
missed her mom,

310
01:32:53,048 --> 01:32:55,642
Really?
What did you said?

311
01:32:57,352 --> 01:32:58,182
Nothing,

312
01:32:59,721 --> 01:33:00,551
What do you mean?

313
01:33:03,625 --> 01:33:05,320
He didn't gave me a chance
to say something,

314
01:33:06,428 --> 01:33:08,555
He was sure that I will say yes,

315
01:33:09,898 --> 01:33:12,298
so he didn't find out what I said,

316
01:33:14,736 --> 01:33:15,725
What's the matter?

317
01:33:16,871 --> 01:33:17,929
You are not happy,

318
01:33:24,012 --> 01:33:27,812
Dhruv and me are best friends,

319
01:33:30,051 --> 01:33:31,518
I am an emotional fool,

320
01:33:32,153 --> 01:33:33,643
and he is a practical person,

321
01:33:34,656 --> 01:33:36,521
And I always felt that...

322
01:33:37,358 --> 01:33:38,950
it will our good combination,

323
01:33:39,494 --> 01:33:42,327
you know he will bring a correct
balance in my life,

324
01:33:57,846 --> 01:34:00,406
Little sign and you will know,

325
01:34:01,316 --> 01:34:02,806
you will feel it,

326
01:34:15,563 --> 01:34:17,656
If you ever came to Mumbai...

327
01:34:36,217 --> 01:34:38,185
Call her to reach mumbai,

328
01:34:47,662 --> 01:34:49,687
Do what you always do,

329
01:34:50,198 --> 01:34:52,530
not from the mind but think
from your heart,

330
01:34:55,370 --> 01:34:58,533
I know you will do the correct thing,

331
01:35:14,522 --> 01:35:18,083
What are you doing here?
I came to meet you,

332
01:35:23,298 --> 01:35:24,890
I came to mumbai for some job reason,

333
01:35:25,633 --> 01:35:28,033
So I thought I should ask you
for Mumbai tour,

334
01:35:33,675 --> 01:35:36,473
My dad said that my timing is
totally rubbish,

335
01:35:37,845 --> 01:35:38,573
how is that?

336
01:35:38,813 --> 01:35:41,714
His honey moon period has ruined
because I born,

337
01:35:44,819 --> 01:35:47,413
Nothing has changed,
you and your poorjokes.

338
01:35:48,723 --> 01:35:50,452
Please don't make them more poor,

339
01:36:03,838 --> 01:36:06,068
Many things happened in Arjun
and Guithari's wedding,

340
01:36:10,445 --> 01:36:12,675
Now everything seems slow,

341
01:36:14,582 --> 01:36:16,573
I still sing wedding songs in shower,

342
01:36:22,523 --> 01:36:23,854
So Radhika is ready,

343
01:36:25,226 --> 01:36:26,488
Now Radhika is not ready,

344
01:36:34,902 --> 01:36:37,370
I have recognised slightly
and perfect option,

345
01:36:44,312 --> 01:36:47,406
Radhika and Me
It was a question mark on our future,

346
01:36:47,915 --> 01:36:51,078
But my mom is still behind me,

347
01:36:54,656 --> 01:36:56,453
Moms are kind of that,

348
01:37:04,432 --> 01:37:06,423
His situation is very interesting,

349
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:10,266
with Sheela?

350
01:37:11,105 --> 01:37:12,766
What happen?
Slap,

351
01:37:35,763 --> 01:37:37,788
I am Govind,
Sheela's friend,

352
01:37:38,333 --> 01:37:39,800
I don't sell cards,

353
01:37:41,803 --> 01:37:42,997
You are sheela's friend,

354
01:57:57,517 --> 01:57:59,451
I think nobody is coming,

355
01:58:06,459 --> 01:58:10,452
Are you thinking the same what
I am thinking,

356
01:58:16,503 --> 01:58:17,731
I am afraid...

357
01:58:18,872 --> 01:58:21,204
that I am thinking what you
are thinking,

358
01:58:23,310 --> 01:58:24,470
Let's go!

359
01:58:35,789 --> 01:58:38,519
What we should keep her name?
Hungry!

360
01:58:53,573 --> 01:58:54,801
I think I should leave now,

361
01:58:57,110 --> 01:58:59,374
Wait for a minute!
I will be back,

362
01:59:35,682 --> 01:59:38,845
I am sure it would be on
right side,

363
01:59:41,087 --> 01:59:43,214
Why did you do that?
It's cold.

364
01:59:57,203 --> 01:59:58,170
I should leave.

365
02:00:14,254 --> 02:00:17,121
But tomorow is my important
lunch meeting,

366
02:00:18,758 --> 02:00:20,692
I forgot that you works.

367
02:00:22,195 --> 02:00:23,287
Assume it like that,

368
02:00:31,371 --> 02:00:32,565
How is everthing going?

369
02:00:34,974 --> 02:00:36,737
Next year we will bring more
new products,

370
02:00:50,190 --> 02:00:51,316
How did you get this injury?

371
02:00:53,126 --> 02:00:54,855
Last night...
Some guys...

372
02:00:55,862 --> 02:00:57,193
About a girl.

373
02:01:00,767 --> 02:01:01,893
She is your friend,

374
02:01:05,805 --> 02:01:06,772
Special friend,

375
02:01:14,881 --> 02:01:16,610
Does she know how special
she is,

376
02:01:18,051 --> 02:01:20,042
No! Why?

377
02:01:21,621 --> 02:01:22,952
You didn't tell her,

378
02:01:38,738 --> 02:01:43,038
Relationships are complicated like you
want to make them,

379
02:01:44,144 --> 02:01:45,042
Remember one thing,

380
02:01:45,945 --> 02:01:47,469
In life and movies...

381
02:01:48,214 --> 02:01:50,114
Everything goes perfect in end,

382
02:01:52,452 --> 02:01:53,749
What is in your heart.

383
02:01:54,888 --> 02:01:55,786
Say it,

384
02:01:59,793 --> 02:02:00,851
Where is she?

385
02:02:07,634 --> 02:02:09,534
She is right behind you.

386
02:02:58,351 --> 02:03:00,216
And you fulfilled my wish,

387
02:03:04,123 --> 02:03:06,648
I don't know you are so filmy,

388
02:03:13,466 --> 02:03:16,799
When 99'/, girls meet SRK so they all
react like this,

389
02:03:22,942 --> 02:03:24,204
Have you seen DDLJ,

390
02:03:24,510 --> 02:03:26,273
Yes!
But it's been a wild.

391
02:03:31,251 --> 02:03:32,548
I will show you right now,

392
02:04:08,588 --> 02:04:10,556
First dry your self then rain,

393
02:04:16,429 --> 02:04:17,259
Look at this,

394
02:04:27,240 --> 02:04:30,038
You decide it,
It's chinese and Indian,

395
02:04:34,213 --> 02:04:36,545
Do you know how to make
perfect maggi,

396
02:04:38,818 --> 02:04:40,752
Add some water and maggi,

397
02:04:41,120 --> 02:04:42,815
then boil it for 2 minutes,

398
02:04:45,625 --> 02:04:46,819
and besides that...

399
02:04:48,761 --> 02:04:51,161
Add some cheese and chillies,

400
02:05:00,006 --> 02:05:01,633
You are beautiful,

401
02:05:03,309 --> 02:05:04,298
You are smart,

402
02:05:09,082 --> 02:05:11,448
and you can make perfect maggi with
a secret ingredient,

403
02:05:15,621 --> 02:05:17,248
you can get any kind of guy,

404
02:05:19,726 --> 02:05:21,284
So why you didn't get...

405
02:05:30,636 --> 02:05:31,898
When a girl borns...

406
02:05:32,405 --> 02:05:33,997
Get her married at any cost,

407
02:05:47,420 --> 02:05:48,648
You got married twice,

408
02:05:49,455 --> 02:05:50,319
What you got?

409
02:05:56,763 --> 02:05:57,855
My logic was simple.

410
02:05:58,364 --> 02:05:59,456
I thought...

411
02:05:59,799 --> 02:06:03,963
When I will find a person like me,

412
02:06:44,644 --> 02:06:46,236
I will call you back,

413
02:06:58,391 --> 02:07:00,120
So which Jai you were expecting,

414
02:07:03,529 --> 02:07:05,258
you are not becoming aunt in
9 months,

415
02:07:06,065 --> 02:07:07,896
I will become aunt after your wedding,

416
02:07:08,167 --> 02:07:10,761
Now tell me this Jai is Arjun's friend,

417
02:07:16,742 --> 02:07:19,734
That you both have some connection,

418
02:07:39,432 --> 02:07:40,922
It's a matter of life,

419
02:07:41,667 --> 02:07:42,463
Think about it,

420
02:07:43,202 --> 02:07:44,863
Shall I talk to Arjun?

421
02:07:54,447 --> 02:07:56,745
How come you are here?
May I come in?

422
02:07:59,085 --> 02:08:01,519
Only seven days are enough to
love singapore,

423
02:08:02,555 --> 02:08:04,284
I finsihed my work and came back,

424
02:08:04,657 --> 02:08:07,091
When I land here so I realised that
I forgot my house key at home,

425
02:08:12,331 --> 02:08:13,593
What this dog is doing here?

426
02:08:14,667 --> 02:08:15,793
It's not a dog,

427
02:08:17,637 --> 02:08:20,572
Her name is lucky,
But it's a dog,

428
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:23,138
Where did you find him?
On streets,

429
02:08:23,809 --> 02:08:26,107
She was alone,
And you brought her home,

430
02:08:39,592 --> 02:08:41,992
you take shower

431
02:08:42,595 --> 02:08:44,028
and I will be back from studio,

432
02:08:44,363 --> 02:08:46,228
I am taking Lucky along,

433
02:08:59,078 --> 02:09:02,275
Will you please keep lucky for
few hours,

434
02:09:06,419 --> 02:09:07,818
I will call you in evening,

435
02:10:03,376 --> 02:10:05,469
And you ring the bell.

436
02:10:17,456 --> 02:10:19,583
This is lucky and she is with you,

437
02:10:23,362 --> 02:10:25,125
She involves everyone in her
social service,

438
02:10:42,782 --> 02:10:44,079
Jai with your lucky,

439
02:10:50,122 --> 02:10:51,350
I should have make a phone call.

440
02:11:01,500 --> 02:11:02,694
I gave her meal.

441
02:11:08,240 --> 02:11:10,037
So! I guess I should leave now,

442
02:11:10,343 --> 02:11:12,436
You just arrived,
But...

443
02:11:12,611 --> 02:11:14,203
I came to mumbai forjob reason,

444
02:11:14,680 --> 02:11:18,241
And now my job is over so I guess
I should prepare to go back.

445
02:11:19,552 --> 02:11:20,678
Spend your evening with us,

446
02:11:22,288 --> 02:11:24,688
I forgot to tell you I have invited
few friends,

447
02:11:26,826 --> 02:11:27,554
So now?

448
02:11:27,827 --> 02:11:29,954
Now we have to orgznize drinks
and dinner,

449
02:11:35,935 --> 02:11:38,267
But I should leave.

450
02:11:52,151 --> 02:11:53,584
Two players in one team,

451
02:11:53,953 --> 02:11:57,047
One player have to explain the first
word written on the card,

452
02:12:14,874 --> 02:12:17,240
Like Ritu is written on some card,

453
02:12:17,843 --> 02:12:20,311
So it's next 5 words will be...

454
02:12:41,033 --> 02:12:43,024
He knows lucky only and he
can't play Tabboo,

455
02:12:56,182 --> 02:12:57,547
Your time starts now,

456
02:12:57,950 --> 02:13:02,614
When we were in school so your
teacher gave you and you can't make it

457
02:13:17,102 --> 02:13:19,366
Eggs!
Not eggs something else.

458
02:13:41,927 --> 02:13:43,451
Where we met first time,

459
02:13:48,167 --> 02:13:49,464
It's very simple.

460
02:13:50,636 --> 02:13:54,299
I said yellow and you said orange,

461
02:14:35,114 --> 02:14:36,376
Everyone was watching you,

462
02:14:44,156 --> 02:14:46,920
Investment banking is a streeful line,

463
02:14:48,027 --> 02:14:50,996
It's hard to get right decision
on right time,

464
02:14:51,864 --> 02:14:53,092
I guess like a life,

465
02:14:54,466 --> 02:14:56,263
That's why I got this social
smoking habit,

466
02:14:57,603 --> 02:14:58,627
I can understand,

467
02:15:22,728 --> 02:15:23,922
In fact you didn't get married yet,

468
02:15:27,166 --> 02:15:28,190
I didn't get time,

469
02:15:29,435 --> 02:15:30,493
What's your excuse?

470
02:15:33,005 --> 02:15:34,063
I didn't find a right girl,

471
02:15:36,742 --> 02:15:38,300
Everyone is leaving after
the desserts,

472
02:15:42,214 --> 02:15:42,771
What?

473
02:15:43,916 --> 02:15:44,814
Plan to have dessert,

474
02:15:46,485 --> 02:15:47,281
Then we will go.

475
02:15:50,356 --> 02:15:51,345
Let's go.

476
02:16:05,738 --> 02:16:07,035
Good to meet you again,

477
02:17:06,832 --> 02:17:08,390
Thank God you have my house key,

478
02:17:18,243 --> 02:17:20,143
So! What did you decide?

479
02:17:21,380 --> 02:17:22,210
About what?

480
02:17:26,418 --> 02:17:27,783
What kind of wedding you want?

481
02:17:31,156 --> 02:17:34,523
You always like beach wedding idea,

482
02:17:42,101 --> 02:17:43,363
There is a weekend in 2 days,

483
02:17:53,645 --> 02:17:55,613
You just have to come and
finalise the house,

484
02:17:57,149 --> 02:18:00,277
Don't you think everything
is going so fast.

485
02:24:22,033 --> 02:24:24,058
Can I talk to Naina for 2 minutes,

486
02:24:44,322 --> 02:24:45,687
If ever...

487
02:24:50,428 --> 02:24:52,293
you got a perfect option,

488
02:24:56,568 --> 02:24:58,160
If you recognise that,

489
02:25:02,908 --> 02:25:05,035
Can we raise our hands without
any fear,

490
02:25:07,312 --> 02:25:08,779
Can we hope...

491
02:25:17,822 --> 02:25:18,811
our story...

492
02:25:20,058 --> 02:25:21,116
will be different,

493
02:25:22,627 --> 02:25:23,992
Jai!
It's a right time,

494
02:25:24,896 --> 02:25:25,760
So it is,

495
02:25:27,299 --> 02:25:28,197
if there is a chance,

496
02:25:30,101 --> 02:25:30,795
So it is.

497
02:25:33,905 --> 02:25:35,702
All I need your answer,

498
02:25:37,475 --> 02:25:38,134
that's all.

499
02:25:40,946 --> 02:25:42,208
Jai is totally mad,

500
02:25:43,014 --> 02:25:45,482
He think guys should also rub
heena on their hands,

501
02:25:46,284 --> 02:25:48,149
Because of him we got shortage
of heena today,

502
02:25:49,187 --> 02:25:52,315
And because of him Gaithari's mayun
was great,

503
02:25:53,792 --> 02:25:56,352
I really dance alot after so long,

504
02:26:01,633 --> 02:26:02,361
There is still more,

505
02:26:04,869 --> 02:26:06,666
When I came back from the wedding,

506
02:26:07,439 --> 02:26:09,407
Everything seems changed,

507
02:26:10,308 --> 02:26:11,036
Incomplete,

508
02:26:12,711 --> 02:26:15,077
Sometimes I feel I forgot something there,

509
02:26:16,114 --> 02:26:17,376
Even I check my bags,

510
02:26:18,984 --> 02:26:19,746
I think...

511
02:26:20,452 --> 02:26:22,477
Change is not in things and
environment,

512
02:26:23,855 --> 02:26:24,719
but it's inside me,

513
02:26:31,763 --> 02:26:33,060
that change is Jai,

514
02:26:36,167 --> 02:26:38,328
I wish I would meet Jai earlier,

515
02:26:39,170 --> 02:26:40,501
So what I have realised,

516
02:26:40,872 --> 02:26:45,002
I would have permission and courage
to accept that,

517
02:26:46,244 --> 02:26:47,211
But Dhruv...

518
02:26:52,250 --> 02:26:54,184
he is also a part of my life,

519
02:26:56,187 --> 02:26:57,848
Whom I will have to answer,

520
02:26:58,790 --> 02:26:59,779
What will I tell him?

521
02:27:10,101 --> 02:27:11,090
You should tell me the truth,

522
02:27:11,803 --> 02:27:13,395
First from your self then to me,

523
02:27:40,031 --> 02:27:41,896
Naina we were always friends,

524
02:27:42,801 --> 02:27:44,166
then we decided to get married,

525
02:27:45,370 --> 02:27:47,395
It's not necessary that decision
was right,

526
02:27:54,946 --> 02:27:57,005
I wanted to tell you,

527
02:27:59,451 --> 02:28:00,713
It was happening so soon,

528
02:28:07,826 --> 02:28:09,487
Jai I found this diary that morning,

529
02:28:09,894 --> 02:28:11,657
When I met you at Naina's house.

530
02:28:26,478 --> 02:28:27,672
I talked to Ritu,

531
02:28:28,913 --> 02:28:31,108
So she told the same what I
didn't want to listen,

532
02:28:32,650 --> 02:28:33,810
And that evening,

533
02:28:34,386 --> 02:28:35,944
what you spent with us,

534
02:28:40,825 --> 02:28:42,292
But it was necessary to testify,

535
02:28:49,401 --> 02:28:50,129
Remember!

536
02:28:51,436 --> 02:28:52,266
I told you,

537
02:28:53,805 --> 02:28:56,740
It's hard to get right decision on
right time,

538
02:28:58,877 --> 02:28:59,866
Like life.

539
02:29:04,249 --> 02:29:05,546
This decision is not so simple,

540
02:29:07,051 --> 02:29:08,143
But it was necessary,

541
02:29:10,321 --> 02:29:11,049
for three of us,

542
02:29:22,133 --> 02:29:23,964
I didn't book your tickets,

543
02:30:10,348 --> 02:30:11,610

to walk on them.

This isolation screams..

But he was very adamant.

399

He wanted to deal with
things on his own.

400
00:39:41,866 --> 00:39:44,702
He wanted his father to feel
proud about him.

He could have killed you
anywhere during the journey.

815
01:12:39,733 --> 01:12:42,669
And I had a fight
with him for the same.

That car, sir.

Come out!

877

Where are you off to?

What's your problem?

Look, don't forget that
you're in uniform. Do your duty.

Finger down. Who are you?
Commissioner?

882
01:17:48,566 --> 01:17:49,633
I agree I'm not Commissioner of

I'm a Commissioner.

884

I know your seniors very well.

Learn to respect them.
- Yes, sir.

Free him. - But, sir. we've
found a loaded gun with him.

887
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,501
He has a license.

888
01:18:00,366 --> 01:18:01,533
And he hasn't committed
any crime. Free him.

889
01:18:01,633 --> 01:18:03,568
Okay, sir. Thakur,
bring him. - Yes, sir.

890
01:18:04,533 --> 01:18:05,533
Sir, tea or something?

891

Sir, the sweet mart here are

892
01:18:17,399 --> 01:18:18,501
Give him his gun.

For the first time..

911
01:21:06,333 --> 01:21:10,370
.. I personally came out
for my work in so many years.

912
01:21:13,366 --> 01:21:14,400
Because of you.

913
01:21:17,166 --> 01:21:18,267
You're so kind, Victor.

There's a twist in the tale.

Now there'll be fun.

920
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,368
Constable, take them
for the post-mortem.

921
01:22:04,133 --> 01:22:05,167
Orian sir!

922
01:22:06,133 --> 01:22:09,135
AC is on. Do you
want to switch it off?

923
01:22:10,166 --> 01:22:11,267
Yes, switch it off.

924
01:22:11,333 --> 01:22:14,069
Let me breathe the
air of this place. - Okay.

925
01:22:14,166 --> 01:22:16,134
Switch off the AC.

926
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:19,367
Switch off the AC.

927
01:22:26,166 --> 01:22:28,067
You didn't answer me properly.

928
01:22:30,133 --> 01:22:31,267
Why did you call me son?

929
01:22:32,133 --> 01:22:35,135
From last many years
I didn't call anybody son.

930
01:22:39,166 --> 01:22:41,268
Don't know Rajeev whether
you're aware of it or not. .

931
01:22:42,133 --> 01:22:44,101
.. but I am an
ex-police officer.

932
01:22:46,066 --> 01:22:48,101
But when I joined police force..

933
01:22:48,233 --> 01:22:52,036
.. I was sent on a mission
to tackle a group.

934
01:22:53,233 --> 01:22:56,302
I started working in that
group posing as their man.

935
01:22:58,100 --> 01:22:59,267
We accomplished many big tasks

936
01:22:59,266 --> 01:23:01,101
like in Orissa,
Tamilnadu, Bihar.

937
01:23:02,333 --> 01:23:05,102
They had one thumb rule.

938
01:23:06,033 --> 01:23:08,135
Every member of that
group should have a mark. .

939
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:12,036
.. on his left shoulder.
See this.

940
01:23:13,133 --> 01:23:15,268
Besides me there were
3 more members in that group.

941
01:23:17,266 --> 01:23:21,103
One was Simon,
the other was Anuvidan..

942
01:23:23,266 --> 01:23:27,103
And the third one was.. Orian.

943
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:30,035

Why do you feel like this?

00:03:54,544 --> 00:03:56,171
And my guards..

51
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,474
You press that.. I will press this.

52
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:07,381
You don't know who my husband is.

53
00:04:14,397 --> 00:04:15,591
Go catch him.

54
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:24,597
Hurry up.

55
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,248
Surprising.

56
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:46,659
A thief spoiled my shopping
and you are looking angry.

57
00:04:49,532 --> 00:04:50,794
Why did you sound the alarm?

58
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:55,360
I wanted to see you in action,
Charlie Mascarenhas.

59
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:57,500
'Are you happy now?'

60
00:04:57,573 --> 00:04:59,438
'Pick me up once you
finish your shopping.

61
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,179
Good morning.

62
00:05:05,248 --> 00:05:07,716
Hello, and hands up.

63
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:09,815
Hello, and hands up.

64
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:12,613
Hello.

65
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:14,179
Good morning.

66
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:25,063
You are my inspiration.

67
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:27,232
Keep your inspiration to yourself..

68
00:05:27,303 --> 00:05:28,827
..and give me my share.

69
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,067
You already took that.

70
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:36,444
You don't know who my husband is

71
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:41,183
You are a real artist, Charlie.

72
00:05:42,118 --> 00:05:44,484
Come on, let's go celebrate.

73
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:46,450
You know the rules.

74
00:05:46,522 --> 00:05:50,583
Six months before and after the job..
- We won't see each other.

75
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:53,161
Its only six months.

76
00:07:22,785 --> 00:07:24,252
Debrovsky.

77
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:37,756
Hi. Please leave your
message after the beep.

78
00:07:39,068 --> 00:07:40,399
Hello, Shaila.

79
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,802
I sent you a parcel a month ago..

80
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:44,766
..and said that if
anything happens to me..

81
00:07:45,374 --> 00:07:47,137
..then send that parcel to Charlie.

82
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:51,241
Seems like its time to
send that parcel to Charlie.

83
00:07:56,452 --> 00:07:57,578
Where is the plan?

84
00:07:58,221 --> 00:08:01,088
Where is it? Tell me.

85
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,587
Shaila, my heart felt condolences.

86
00:09:10,526 --> 00:09:12,619
It's been less than four
days since your husband died..

87
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:15,488
..and you already stopped mourning.

88
00:09:19,235 --> 00:09:23,638
Why? Don't you see my black dress?

89
00:09:26,242 --> 00:09:28,802
Anyway? Why did you call me here?

90
00:09:31,414 --> 00:09:36,044
Raj sent this from Moscow a
month before he died, for you.

91
00:09:36,752 --> 00:09:38,185
He said that if
anything happens to him..

92
00:09:38,254 --> 00:09:40,188
..then I should give it too you.

93
00:09:40,256 --> 00:09:42,816
Your childhood
memory and all that crap.

94
00:09:43,092 --> 00:09:44,389
Thank you.

95
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,722
Charlie.

96
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:49,060
Raj has left something for you.

97
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:53,226
It can be yours if you want.

98
00:09:54,103 --> 00:09:56,537
You are hot, Shaila.
- I know.

99
00:09:56,572 --> 00:09:59,473
But not so much that
I betray my friend.

100
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:03,440
And if I know Raj, he
has left much more for me.

101
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:06,508
See you.

102
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:10,349
The entire library
is waiting to be his.

103
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:12,250
And he's interested in that book.

104
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:44,382
If you're watching this DVD..

105
00:10:44,754 --> 00:10:46,517
..then the breaking news is..

106
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,748
Come on, not again.

107
00:11:00,803 --> 00:11:03,533
Hello, Naina. You hacked
into my computer again.

108
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:05,073
What can I do, Charlie?

109
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:07,109
That's the only way
to make you call me.

110
00:11:07,176 --> 00:11:08,234
Naina, be serious.

111
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,244
I have to watch an important DVD.

112
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:12,309
I hope you are not watching porn.

113
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:14,675
I didn't know that a well educated..

114
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:16,708
..chartered accountant type
of person also watches porn.

115
00:11:16,786 --> 00:11:18,811
I am not watching porn.

116
00:11:19,088 --> 00:11:20,214
Whatever.

117
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:23,224
I just wanted to tell you
that I have finished my course.

118
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:25,658
For your information, now I
am a Masters in Computers..

119
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:27,195
..with a gold medal.

120
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:28,560
Well done.

121
00:11:33,436 --> 00:11:34,733
Hey, wow.

122
00:11:34,804 --> 00:11:35,862
Hey. How are you doing?

123
00:11:36,138 --> 00:11:38,333
Come jump in my car
we'll go for a drive.

124
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:40,204
Hang out, do some stuff.

125
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:45,805
Come on.

126
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,343
Naina.
- The second good news is..

127
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,319
..that I am coming
back to India tomorrow.

128
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:54,822
Really? Fantastic.

129
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,358
Good, now fix my computer.

130
00:11:57,426 --> 00:12:00,327
Just type my name on
your computer sweetly..

131
00:12:00,396 --> 00:12:01,658
..and it will be fixed.

132
00:12:01,731 --> 00:12:02,823
But sweetly, okay.

133
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:04,794
Fine. Sweetly.

134
00:12:41,203 --> 00:12:42,830
If you're watching this DVD..

135
00:12:43,372 --> 00:12:44,737
..then the breaking news is that..

136
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:46,775
..the Russian Mafia has killed me.

137
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,771
Today I am going to
tell you a last story.

138
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,408
This story started in 1915.

139
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:56,784
During World War 1
when the German army..

140
00:12:56,852 --> 00:12:59,252
..reached Romania's
capital Bucharest then..

141
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:02,415
..the Romanian government
decided to flee for their lives.

142
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:05,517
They took important
documents and their treasures along.

143
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:12,228
The Czar of Russia agreed
to keep their treasure..

144
00:13:12,301 --> 00:13:15,361
..showing that they
are good neighbors.

145
00:13:15,571 --> 00:13:17,095
Until the war ended.

146
00:13:17,473 --> 00:13:19,634
So in this way, on 15 October 1916..

147
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:23,839
..tons of gold were
sent to Russia by train.

148
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,172
But by the end of the war..

149
00:13:26,248 --> 00:13:28,182
..the Russian government changed.

150
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,651
The new government
refused to entertain Romania.

151
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,278
''Which gold are you talking about?''

152
00:13:33,756 --> 00:13:36,384
And for the past 95 years that gold..

153
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,154
..has been locked up in the
Russian Czar's winter palace.

154
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:42,289
But the twist in the
story came in this year..

155
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:45,356
..when Russia finally accepted
that what happened was wrong.

156
00:13:45,434 --> 00:13:46,799
And on this 15th October..

157
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:48,734
..that gold will be
shipped back to Romania.

158
00:13:48,804 --> 00:13:50,704
Exactly the same way, by train.

159
00:13:50,773 --> 00:13:52,468
Just like it was brought here.

160
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,099
Pure Romanian gold..

161
00:13:54,176 --> 00:13:58,112
..which is worth 1
billion in today's date.

162
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,313
If Romania could survive for
95 years without the gold..

163
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:02,475
..then it can do so in future as well.

164
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,246
And it never
belonged to Russia anyway.

165
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,053
When something's unclaimed..

166
00:14:06,488 --> 00:14:10,481
..then it either belongs to
God or to decent people like us.

167
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:12,125
Isn't it?

168
00:14:13,796 --> 00:14:16,560
Before I leave I want
to give you a final tip.

169
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:19,300
Don't make the mistake that I did.

170
00:14:19,635 --> 00:14:21,796
This is not a job for one person.

171
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:23,500
You need a team, Charlie.

172
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,768
A team of the world's best players.

173
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:30,773
And there's just one man
who can get you that team.

174
00:14:31,113 --> 00:14:33,843
Our guru, Victor.

175
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:40,481
Victor sir.

176
00:14:40,556 --> 00:14:41,818
This is the safe of the house..

177
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:43,285
..where the robbery was committed.

178
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:44,758
Its been three weeks..

179
00:14:44,827 --> 00:14:47,125
..but we couldn't
apprehend the thief yet.

180
00:14:47,196 --> 00:14:49,391
If you want to catch a cunning thief..

181
00:14:49,665 --> 00:14:51,223
..then try to understand him.

182
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:56,732
Not like a policeman but think
like a thief. - Note it down.

183
00:14:56,805 --> 00:14:59,137
Thieves have three rules..

184
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,199
..that differentiate
them from policemen.

185
00:15:01,577 --> 00:15:03,511
Rule no.1.

186
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:06,070
Every thief is a kind of an artist.

187
00:15:06,582 --> 00:15:09,779
And no thief betrays his art.

188
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,179
A policeman might forget
his duty but not a thief.

189
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,717
Rule no.2.

190
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:22,457
Only policemen retire. Not thieves.

191
00:15:23,365 --> 00:15:26,198
Once a thief always a thief.

192
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:31,630
Rule no.3 and the most important rule.

193
00:15:32,107 --> 00:15:36,373
When a policeman is
tired of racking his brains..

194
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:40,313
..that's where a
thief starts using his.

195
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:44,415
Why do I feel that
he is slandering us?

196
00:15:45,587 --> 00:15:48,488
Victor sir. What do you want to say?

197
00:15:48,557 --> 00:15:53,790
I want to say that you
have lodged the wrong FIR.

198
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:58,323
This isn't a case of robbery
of jewelry worth 40 lakhs.

199
00:15:58,734 --> 00:16:01,202
Come on, just help me here.

200
00:16:01,403 --> 00:16:05,271
Come, let's watch those
two pictures carefully.

201
00:16:05,774 --> 00:16:09,574
One before the robbery
and the other after it.

202
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:13,104
Do you see the
difference in both the pictures?

203
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:14,748
I don't understand.

204
00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:20,346
I mean the thief wanted Mr.
Malik's painting and he took it.

205
00:16:20,723 --> 00:16:24,124
And he put up a fake
painting instead. - Fake painting?

206
00:16:27,796 --> 00:16:29,161
Take a look.

207
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,658
Look, this is the real painting.

208
00:16:31,734 --> 00:16:34,134
Look at the signature stroke here.

209
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:35,295
Its small, isn't it?

210
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:37,737
And this one is fake.

211
00:16:37,806 --> 00:16:40,536
Look at the signature
stroke below this one.

212
00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:42,236
It's longer.

213
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,576
It's longer, isn't it?

214
00:16:44,847 --> 00:16:46,838
This is the work of a woman.

215
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:49,444
How can you say that?

216
00:16:49,518 --> 00:16:51,418
My CA will tell you that.

217
00:16:54,757 --> 00:16:58,454
Before the robbery this vase was here.

218
00:16:58,761 --> 00:17:05,633
But after the robbery it
automatically shifted here.

219
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:08,536
These aesthetics can
never be of a man.

220
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:11,737
Do you understand now?

221
00:17:12,307 --> 00:17:13,433
Yes, sir.

222
00:17:14,643 --> 00:17:18,602
Do send me sweets when
you catch the thief.

223
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,443
Of course, sir.

224
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:22,773
How are you?
- Fine.

225
00:17:23,352 --> 00:17:27,686
And my child Naina..
- She has now grown up.

226
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:31,453
Oh, yes. It's been 10 years. 10 years.

227
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:35,524
Doesn't she want to meet me?

228
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:38,392
She just returned yesterday.
She is suffering from jetlag.

229
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:40,731
Let it be. I know her.

230
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:42,361
She is like me.

231
00:17:43,205 --> 00:17:44,570
She won't be convinced so easily.

232
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:48,071
Grandpa, there was another thing.

233
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:52,737
This is the 80 acre land
which you bought near Shimla.

234
00:17:52,815 --> 00:17:54,510
This is our student dormitory.

235
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,244
These are the staff quarters.

236
00:17:56,318 --> 00:17:58,513
And they will be so good that..

237
00:17:58,587 --> 00:18:02,216
..the best teachers of
India would want to teach here.

238
00:18:02,691 --> 00:18:04,659
And all the facilities
will be available here..

239
00:18:04,726 --> 00:18:08,025
..for orphan children to
help them compete in the world.

240
00:18:08,564 --> 00:18:09,724
In short.

241
00:18:10,532 --> 00:18:12,227
My incomplete dream.

242
00:18:12,668 --> 00:18:14,659
Your dream can be fulfilled.

243
00:18:16,605 --> 00:18:17,731
How?

244
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,064
I am your CA.

245
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,577
I must have thought of something.

246
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,612
You surely didn't
think of anything straight.

247
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,272
If you want to fulfill your dreams..

248
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:28,077
..in this country with a
population of 100 crore..

249
00:18:28,283 --> 00:18:30,274
..then you can't think straight.

250
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,214
You taught me this.

251
00:18:34,223 --> 00:18:36,248
You must have heard about Raj's death.

252
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:39,149
He shouldn't have
attempted this job alone.

253
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:47,429
This is the lead that
Raj has provided us.

254
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:50,097
And this has the plan
that I have thought about.

255
00:18:51,273 --> 00:18:52,831
But I need your help.

256
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:54,606
And some players as well.

257
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,077
Which only you can provide me.

258
00:18:59,481 --> 00:19:02,678
You know I have retired.

259
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:05,010
Rule no.2.

260
00:19:05,287 --> 00:19:07,448
Only policemen retire.

261
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:14,194
You have fulfilled mine, Raj
and dreams of so many others.

262
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:18,427
I just want your only
dream to be fulfilled.

263
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:20,661
Grandpa.

264
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:25,469
Naina was asking me to
remind you about some promise.

265
00:19:30,746 --> 00:19:32,441
Give this to Naina.

266
00:19:32,514 --> 00:19:35,176
And tell her that her
papa has earned this..

267
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,184
..by weaving baskets in jail.

268
00:19:46,528 --> 00:19:47,790
How is papa?

269
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:49,223
Is he fine?

270
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:51,263
Did you remind him about my promise?

271
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:55,560
Here, madam. Your father
has sent this for you.

272
00:19:55,837 --> 00:19:57,464
His hard earned money.

273
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,446
You are crying.
- No, I am not.

274
00:20:07,516 --> 00:20:09,814
Yes, you are crying.

275
00:20:12,454 --> 00:20:13,716
I love him, Charlie.

276
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,650
I miss him.
- Its okay.

277
00:20:19,861 --> 00:20:21,192
Three weeks.

278
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:23,197
After that it will be
just my father and me.

279
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:26,100
Even his CA will have to fix
an appointment through me..

280
00:20:26,168 --> 00:20:28,102
..to meet him, okay.

281
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,698
Done.

282
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:01,826
Three?

283
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,738
Has this become
legal in India as well?

284
00:21:05,207 --> 00:21:07,437
Come on, Naina, I don't
even know these girls.

285
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:08,704
Now I get it.

286
00:21:08,777 --> 00:21:11,302
So this is your financial consultancy.

287
00:21:13,248 --> 00:21:14,738
Hey, Charlie.

288
00:21:16,551 --> 00:21:19,247
Happy birthday, Charlie.

289
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:28,220
''Hey, Charlie.''

290
00:21:28,297 --> 00:21:29,628
''Why you got to be like that?''

291
00:21:29,698 --> 00:21:32,258
''Tonight is your night,
let me delight you.''

292
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:37,363
''Charlie's Angels.''

293
00:21:37,439 --> 00:21:39,873
''This restlessness.''

294
00:21:40,142 --> 00:21:42,542
''The sweet pain.''

295
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:47,480
''The sleepless nights.''

296
00:21:50,886 --> 00:21:52,444
''Charlie's Angels.''

297
00:21:52,587 --> 00:21:55,215
''This restlessness.''

298
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,554
''The sweet pain.''

299
00:21:57,626 --> 00:22:02,689
''The sleepless nights.''

300
00:22:02,764 --> 00:22:05,198
''It's the effect of love.''

301
00:22:05,267 --> 00:22:07,758
''It's a difficult journey.''

302
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:10,430
''I need your support.''

303
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:13,804
''Make my journey easier.''

304
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:19,474
''She crazy, Lord,
give her some sense.''

305
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:24,349
''She crazy, Lord,
give her some sense.''

306
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:27,081
''Her stars are weak.''

307
00:22:27,155 --> 00:22:29,521
''Her intentions don't look good.''

308
00:22:29,591 --> 00:22:32,185
''Her life's in danger.''

309
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,592
''Lord, give her some sense.''

310
00:22:34,663 --> 00:22:40,124
''She crazy, Lord,
give her some sense.''

311
00:23:10,732 --> 00:23:15,567
''Everyone will know
of your love story.''

312
00:23:15,804 --> 00:23:18,295
''Even if you don't speak.''

313
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:20,637
''Your eyes will reveal everything.''

314
00:23:21,143 --> 00:23:25,705
''I admit that you don't
care about the world.''

315
00:23:26,148 --> 00:23:30,676
''But what will your
parents say when they find out.''

316
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:33,652
''Daddy is waiting for me to say yes.''

317
00:23:33,722 --> 00:23:36,384
''Even my mother is ready.''

318
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:42,727
''If you say yes then
he'll bless us both.''

319
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:01,714
Shall I tell you a secret, papa?

320
00:24:01,783 --> 00:24:06,311
I won't go back home
until you don't come back.

321
00:24:13,061 --> 00:24:14,392
How romantic.

322
00:24:17,466 --> 00:24:18,694
So this is what you do..

323
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:21,133
..six months before
and after the jobs.

324
00:24:21,203 --> 00:24:22,602
Rhea.

325
00:24:26,575 --> 00:24:28,167
You are mistaken.

326
00:24:28,243 --> 00:24:29,733
You know I am a one woman man.

327
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,270
That's fine.

328
00:24:33,615 --> 00:24:36,812
But who's that one woman.

329
00:24:39,087 --> 00:24:40,748
We are meeting after six months.

330
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:44,154
Have you got only questions for me?

331
00:24:45,393 --> 00:24:47,293
I have a gift for you as well.

332
00:24:55,337 --> 00:24:56,770
Happy birthday, Charlie.

333
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:01,167
Nice.
- Of course. It's a Malik.

334
00:25:01,409 --> 00:25:02,569
Malik sir.

335
00:25:03,144 --> 00:25:05,669
Then it must be expensive.

336
00:25:06,615 --> 00:25:09,277
Why spend so much?

337
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:12,146
Anything for you, baby.

338
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:17,121
Victor, you were absolutely right.

339
00:25:17,192 --> 00:25:18,420
What?

340
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:23,222
Yes, I met Victor.

341
00:25:23,298 --> 00:25:24,424
What did he say?

342
00:25:24,499 --> 00:25:25,830
He didn't come?

343
00:25:27,168 --> 00:25:28,829
I've given him the plan.

344
00:25:29,104 --> 00:25:30,298
Now let's hope for the best.

345
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:34,637
''Lord, we are your devotees.''

346
00:25:35,143 --> 00:25:39,307
''Such should be our deeds.''

347
00:25:39,714 --> 00:25:42,205
''May we follow the
path of righteousness.''

348
00:25:42,284 --> 00:25:44,650
''And shun evil.''

349
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:48,519
''So that we can lay down
our lives with a smile.''

350
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:52,656
Call the ambulance.
- Quick.

351
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,563
Save me, Jesus.

352
00:25:59,334 --> 00:26:01,302
Doctor, please save him.

353
00:26:01,369 --> 00:26:03,564
There's a lot I have
to learn from him.

354
00:26:05,574 --> 00:26:07,269
Don't worry, Commissioner.

355
00:26:07,576 --> 00:26:09,237
It's my duty to save him.

356
00:26:10,512 --> 00:26:14,107
So, Mr. Braganza. Are you
ready for the operation?

357
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:16,481
It's very risky.

358
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:19,816
But I am prepared to take this risk.

359
00:26:21,222 --> 00:26:22,348
Thank you.

360
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:26,750
But this operation will be expensive.
- I know.

361
00:26:27,362 --> 00:26:29,091
Call on this number.

362
00:26:29,164 --> 00:26:32,133
You will get the entire
amount for the operation.

363
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,465
A person is dying and he's
concerned about the costs.

364
00:26:35,537 --> 00:26:38,529
Okay, Commissioner, we're
going to start the operation..

365
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:41,167
..can you please step out..
- Wish you all the best..

366
00:26:41,242 --> 00:26:42,732
..for the operation.
- Don't worry..

367
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:45,712
..our operation will surely
be successful - Thank you.

368
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,338
Let's go.

369
00:26:49,584 --> 00:26:52,246
''Still a lot to learn.''

370
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,415
But our players.

371
00:26:57,492 --> 00:27:00,484
The players that you
need are present right here.

372
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:05,155
Explosives expert, Bilal Basheer.

373
00:27:07,702 --> 00:27:10,102
Since childhood he
has only two passions.

374
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:13,436
Imported cars and local explosives.

375
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,247
Bilal, you are great.

376
00:27:30,258 --> 00:27:32,624
Bilal, you are great.

377
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:39,499
And since then Bilal Basheer became
Bilal 'Behra' (deaf) with his one ear.

378
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:42,627
Yet, he has contacts in every country.

379
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,831
He can speak 32 languages.

380
00:27:45,073 --> 00:27:49,169
An expert in
explosives and spy devices.

381
00:27:49,811 --> 00:27:51,745
Hello.
- Hello.

382
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:54,708
And he's Sunny Mehra.

383
00:27:57,585 --> 00:28:00,145
Master of prosthetics and makeup.

384
00:28:01,156 --> 00:28:03,090
He actually wanted
to be something else.

385
00:28:03,158 --> 00:28:04,420
Actor.

386
00:28:04,492 --> 00:28:06,483
'That Shah Rukh Khan style.'

387
00:28:07,195 --> 00:28:08,560
'Have you seen your face?'

388
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,097
'Get out, get lost.'

389
00:28:10,665 --> 00:28:11,723
'You don't become a hero..

390
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,563
'..by getting your picture
taken at Juhu Beach. - But..'

391
00:28:13,635 --> 00:28:15,626
That day he decided he
will become an expert..

392
00:28:15,704 --> 00:28:18,104
..in make up and prosthetics.

393
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:21,637
But you will have to stay
slightly careful of him.

394
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,234
He's a makeup artist after all.

395
00:28:23,311 --> 00:28:24,471
He cannot keep a secret.

396
00:28:24,546 --> 00:28:26,173
Did you say anything?

397
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:29,546
No, no, I was just saying
that you are a fine artist.

398
00:28:29,617 --> 00:28:32,643
You are embarrassing me.

399
00:28:32,721 --> 00:28:34,086
You are born to be embarrassed.

400
00:28:34,155 --> 00:28:35,520
Shut up, deaf.

401
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,682
What?

402
00:28:37,325 --> 00:28:39,156
Nothing.
- No, you said something.

403
00:28:39,227 --> 00:28:40,558
I see.

404
00:28:40,795 --> 00:28:43,127
Seems like they get along well.
- Yes.

405
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:46,126
And he is Ronnie.

406
00:28:49,571 --> 00:28:51,835
India's biggest illusionist.

407
00:28:52,307 --> 00:28:53,535
Magician.

408
00:29:22,403 --> 00:29:26,567
Due to some reasons Ronnie
stopped performing magic shows.

409
00:29:26,775 --> 00:29:31,269
But thank God he said yes for
this operation when I asked.

410
00:29:31,446 --> 00:29:33,676
Thanks, Ronnie.
- Yes, thank you.

411
00:29:34,215 --> 00:29:36,183
And you do know Rhea.

412
00:29:37,285 --> 00:29:39,219
Part time automobile expert.

413
00:29:39,287 --> 00:29:41,551
And full time artist like us.

414
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:44,091
There's hardly a man on earth..

415
00:29:44,392 --> 00:29:46,257
..who can resist her charm.

416
00:30:05,814 --> 00:30:08,078
And the next day I
read in the newspapers..

417
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:11,084
..that that night she didn't
just break south Africa's..

418
00:30:11,152 --> 00:30:15,282
..seventh richest man's
heart but also his safe.

419
00:30:16,424 --> 00:30:20,485
But I couldn't provide you
one man according to your plan.

420
00:30:21,162 --> 00:30:22,322
The hacker.

421
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:25,165
Not the hacker, world's best hacker.

422
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:27,391
Spider.

423
00:30:27,468 --> 00:30:30,494
No one knows who he
is or where he lives.

424
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:33,704
So is there an alternative for him?

425
00:30:34,175 --> 00:30:35,506
Is there an alternative for you?

426
00:30:35,577 --> 00:30:37,442
Him, him, or her?

427
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,579
There is no alternative for the best.

428
00:30:39,647 --> 00:30:41,171
You will have to find him.

429
00:30:42,417 --> 00:30:45,443
And one last thing, Charlie.

430
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:48,715
I have broken a big promise.

431
00:30:50,358 --> 00:30:53,486
I will make you pay for it.

432
00:30:54,329 --> 00:30:55,796
To the last gram.

433
00:31:00,268 --> 00:31:03,203
By the way, I have heard
that Spider is the best hacker.

434
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:06,173
He has hacked two of
NASA's satellites.

435
00:31:06,207 --> 00:31:08,402
They had to travel to the Moon..

436
00:31:08,476 --> 00:31:10,171
..but landed on Mars instead.

437
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,611
Which Spider are you talking about?

438
00:31:14,682 --> 00:31:16,547
Just one of his friends.

439
00:31:16,618 --> 00:31:19,746
I thought you are talking about
the world's best hacker Spider.

440
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:28,586
You know about Spider.

441
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,790
Yes, just briefly.

442
00:31:29,864 --> 00:31:31,297
But this must be someone else.

443
00:31:31,366 --> 00:31:34,233
What could a chartered
accountant want from a hacker?

444
00:31:34,402 --> 00:31:35,664
I am interested, Naina.

445
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:37,662
He has stolen millions of
dollars from my clients.

446
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:39,104
By hacking in their bank accounts.

447
00:31:39,173 --> 00:31:40,731
Isn't it, guys?
- Yes, he hacked in..

448
00:31:40,808 --> 00:31:42,742
..and stole my entire showroom.

449
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:45,108
Only left the shutters behind.

450
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:47,277
How do you know about Spider?

451
00:31:47,348 --> 00:31:49,441
Hello. I have done
Masters in Ethical Hacking..

452
00:31:49,517 --> 00:31:51,644
..and Spider was my thesis project.

453
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,452
Do you know who this Spider
is and where we can find him?

454
00:31:54,522 --> 00:31:56,854
I got this close to
finding him couple of times.

455
00:31:56,891 --> 00:31:58,688
Last I heard he was in Hong Kong.

456
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,660
But I lost him
before I could track him.

457
00:32:02,263 --> 00:32:04,629
But if you want I can try again.

458
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:07,328
That's great, Naina. Please Try again.

459
00:32:07,702 --> 00:32:09,192
For all of us.

460
00:32:29,824 --> 00:32:33,385
Charlie, I am feeling sleepy.

461
00:32:33,795 --> 00:32:37,094
Then get some sleep.
- No, I want coffee.

462
00:32:53,815 --> 00:32:55,180
I got him. I got him.

463
00:32:55,249 --> 00:32:57,240
He got the mail. He fell for it.

464
00:32:57,652 --> 00:32:59,586
I hacked his system.

465
00:32:59,821 --> 00:33:01,345
Spider is an Indian.

466
00:33:01,389 --> 00:33:03,653
And you won't believe it, he's in Goa.

467
00:33:03,725 --> 00:33:04,783
What?

468
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:06,492
Can we get his address?

469
00:33:06,561 --> 00:33:08,426
His postal address is.

470
00:33:09,797 --> 00:33:13,699
Riviera Society.
Apartment 304. Anjuna.

471
00:33:14,268 --> 00:33:15,633
Let's go, guys.

472
00:33:50,705 --> 00:33:51,729
You stay near the car.

473
00:33:51,806 --> 00:33:53,103
Riya, Bilal.

474
00:33:53,174 --> 00:33:55,108
Take the lift and cover his door.

475
00:33:55,176 --> 00:33:56,837
Ronny, we will block the stairways.

476
00:34:15,163 --> 00:34:16,391
Hey, pizza-boy.

477
00:34:17,165 --> 00:34:19,065
Where are you going
without making the delivery?

478
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,458
Ronny, I got him.

479
00:34:20,535 --> 00:34:22,366
It's the pizza-boy
and he's coming down.

480
00:35:14,088 --> 00:35:15,817
So finally Spider is
caught in the web.

481
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:18,115
You don't have any
proof that I am Spider.

482
00:35:18,426 --> 00:35:20,155
You can't arrest me.

483
00:35:20,228 --> 00:35:21,388
We are not the police.

484
00:35:21,462 --> 00:35:23,521
Then why are you after me?

485
00:35:23,798 --> 00:35:26,289
We want to tip you, pizza-boy.

486
00:35:27,635 --> 00:35:29,535
Worth 100 million.

487
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:36,299
You need a team, Charlie.

488
00:35:36,811 --> 00:35:39,211
A team of the world's best players.

489
00:35:39,747 --> 00:35:40,805
What the..

490
00:35:41,082 --> 00:35:43,482
You can make a palace
out of all that gold.

491
00:35:44,285 --> 00:35:45,479
What is the plan?

492
00:35:45,553 --> 00:35:47,612
Putting it in one line..

493
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,349
..the plan is that we will
steal the gold from the train..

494
00:35:49,423 --> 00:35:51,288
..in which it is being transported.

495
00:35:51,526 --> 00:35:52,652
Are you serious?

496
00:35:53,294 --> 00:35:55,262
We are talking about an
international robbery.

497
00:35:55,296 --> 00:35:57,355
And if it's Russia's, then the
mafia will be involved as well.

498
00:35:57,431 --> 00:35:59,331
Don't you think this
is a difficult job?

499
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,028
I haven't even started
counting the difficulties.

500
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:07,230
The gold will be transported in this
truck from the Czar's Winter Palace..

501
00:36:07,308 --> 00:36:08,775
..with a military convoy.

502
00:36:10,278 --> 00:36:12,678
The gold will be loaded from
this Russian Military Station..

503
00:36:12,747 --> 00:36:15,113
..into this cargo container.

504
00:36:15,483 --> 00:36:17,747
There are two locks in the container.

505
00:36:19,153 --> 00:36:21,519
Electronic and manual.

506
00:36:22,156 --> 00:36:23,748
And the code to this electronic code..

507
00:36:23,824 --> 00:36:26,520
..will be given to
one Russian General.

508
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:29,090
Coming to the train.

509
00:36:30,831 --> 00:36:33,095
The container filled with gold..

510
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:34,634
..will be loaded on this train, and..

511
00:36:34,702 --> 00:36:37,170
..there will be two
coaches ahead and behind it.

512
00:36:37,471 --> 00:36:39,336
Filled with Russian Commandoes.

513
00:36:39,407 --> 00:36:41,272
The train's speed will be set..

514
00:36:41,342 --> 00:36:43,640
..and its progress will
be tracked by a satellite.

515
00:36:44,278 --> 00:36:47,076
If anything is detected
within a kilometer of its range..

516
00:36:47,114 --> 00:36:48,775
..or if the train
slows down or stops then..

517
00:36:49,317 --> 00:36:54,721
..within three minutes Russian
Fighter Jets will be scrambled.

518
00:36:55,389 --> 00:36:56,754
And the Russian government..

519
00:36:56,824 --> 00:37:00,055
..has published this
information in their local papers.

520
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:06,097
So no one imagines
about touching this gold.

521
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:09,092
But, Charlie, how will we do this?

522
00:37:11,405 --> 00:37:13,032
Your new mobiles.

523
00:37:13,107 --> 00:37:16,508
It contains the plan's details,
your individual roles..

524
00:37:16,577 --> 00:37:18,704
..and also a basic
Russian speaking course.

525
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:28,812
If you want to be a big player..

526
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,058
..then you have to take a big risk.

527
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:38,788
Congratulations, guys.

528
00:37:39,066 --> 00:37:42,593
Soon you each be the
owners of 100 million.

529
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,831
Isn't the gold worth 1 billion

530
00:37:45,106 --> 00:37:46,505
And there are six of us.

531
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,768
Are you deducting TDS?

532
00:37:47,842 --> 00:37:49,366
You can say that.

533
00:37:49,443 --> 00:37:51,274
The remaining share belongs to Victor.

534
00:37:51,746 --> 00:37:53,179
Who is Victor?

535
00:37:53,247 --> 00:37:55,545
Consider Victor as the
non-playing captain of this team.

536
00:37:55,783 --> 00:37:58,013
Committing this big
robbery without his guidance..

537
00:37:58,085 --> 00:37:59,347
..is impossible.

538
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:01,788
The most important thing.

539
00:38:02,189 --> 00:38:04,054
How will we get out after the robbery?

540
00:38:04,091 --> 00:38:06,685
You will know the exit
plan when the time's right.

541
00:38:11,299 --> 00:38:12,596
Sorry, guys. Excuse me.

542
00:38:15,202 --> 00:38:17,295
Yes, Naina.
- What Naina?

543
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:19,771
You promised me that
if I find Spider..

544
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:21,668
..then you will take me out on a date.

545
00:38:21,742 --> 00:38:23,676
Naina, I am really sorry.

546
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,541
Even I wanted to meet you..

547
00:38:26,113 --> 00:38:27,637
..but something urgent has come up.

548
00:38:28,182 --> 00:38:30,446
So I am leaving tomorrow.

549
00:38:31,152 --> 00:38:34,121
And you will have to go
alone to receive Victor as well.

550
00:38:34,288 --> 00:38:36,051
But where are you going?

551
00:38:36,557 --> 00:38:38,752
To make my life's biggest deal.

552
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:41,722
Russia.

553
00:38:57,578 --> 00:39:01,139
Do you like this train?
- Yes, perfect.

554
00:39:02,316 --> 00:39:03,510
They are here.

555
00:39:18,699 --> 00:39:20,223
This is our film unit.

556
00:39:20,301 --> 00:39:21,700
The heroine.

557
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:23,202
Director.

558
00:39:23,237 --> 00:39:24,397
He's the cameraman.

559
00:39:24,472 --> 00:39:25,769
And he's the assistant director.

560
00:39:28,776 --> 00:39:30,767
Makeup man and spot boy.

561
00:39:31,045 --> 00:39:33,775
You could have at
least made me a star here.

562
00:39:34,515 --> 00:39:36,779
Your train.

563
00:39:38,185 --> 00:39:40,085
Enjoy your shoot at Russia.

564
00:39:40,154 --> 00:39:41,621
Thank you.

565
00:39:50,564 --> 00:39:52,464
Try to understand.

566
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:55,626
I cannot tell you anything more.

567
00:39:56,837 --> 00:39:58,361
All I can say is that..

568
00:39:59,073 --> 00:40:01,701
..after this I will
never disappoint you again.

569
00:40:10,184 --> 00:40:12,652
Can I know who you were talking to?

570
00:40:33,674 --> 00:40:36,142
There is just one tunnel between..

571
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,643
..the Russian
Military Base and Romania.

572
00:40:37,711 --> 00:40:40,544
And the train will take
only two minutes to cross it.

573
00:40:40,614 --> 00:40:41,876
And within these two minutes..

574
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:43,745
..Ronnie you will have
to perform your trick..

575
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:46,446
..and Spider you will have
to hack the Russian Satellite.

576
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,817
But after I hack into it..

577
00:40:47,888 --> 00:40:50,516
..the Russian systems will
be down only for 10 minutes.

578
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:53,351
After that the
systems will restart again.

579
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:57,396
That means we have just 10 minutes..

580
00:40:57,465 --> 00:40:59,524
..to execute the entire robbery.

581
00:41:06,207 --> 00:41:07,299
Ticket please.

582
00:41:18,786 --> 00:41:20,185
Thank you.

583
00:41:28,496 --> 00:41:30,259
How is the train moving?

584
00:41:38,572 --> 00:41:41,507
This magician really is dangerous.

585
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,575
I have replaced the engine.

586
00:41:51,652 --> 00:41:54,143
And now I am
installing this power booster.

587
00:41:54,455 --> 00:41:57,583
If all goes well then
this rundown diesel train..

588
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:00,720
..will run at the speed that we want.

589
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:10,363
Hello.
- Yes, CA, how is everything going?

590
00:42:10,671 --> 00:42:13,765
We are working on that,
completely involved in it.

591
00:42:13,841 --> 00:42:15,468
Don't get too involved that..

592
00:42:15,543 --> 00:42:18,273
..you forget how to get out of there.

593
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:21,776
Understood.
- Yes, sir.

594
00:42:22,716 --> 00:42:23,774
Spider.

595
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:26,678
Victor has sent the
exit plan. Check it.

596
00:42:26,754 --> 00:42:28,153
Right.

597
00:42:32,526 --> 00:42:33,618
Charlie.

598
00:42:33,661 --> 00:42:36,528
Charlie. I have hacked into
the Russian Military website.

599
00:42:37,464 --> 00:42:38,795
This is the list of
officers who will be involved..

600
00:42:38,866 --> 00:42:41,562
..in the train that
will be carrying the gold.

601
00:42:42,369 --> 00:42:44,132
The names are according to the rank.

602
00:42:44,204 --> 00:42:45,364
That means the two
generals on the top..

603
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:47,566
..are security in-charge.
- Yes.

604
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:51,507
Lieutenant General Mikhail Levitski.

605
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:54,771
And Major General Dimitry Yegorov.

606
00:42:54,848 --> 00:42:58,249
Bilal, I need all the
information about these two generals.

607
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:00,146
What they eat? How much they drink?

608
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:03,212
And most important, where they sleep.

609
00:43:04,525 --> 00:43:05,617
Bilal.

610
00:43:05,693 --> 00:43:10,460
Hey. We need information
about these two generals.

611
00:43:10,531 --> 00:43:11,793
So why are you screaming?

612
00:43:12,066 --> 00:43:13,328
Because..

613
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,526
Forget it.

614
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:32,517
Your drink.
- Come, sit down.

615
00:43:41,495 --> 00:43:43,326
So he's our man.

616
00:43:45,232 --> 00:43:46,426
So, Riya.

617
00:43:47,267 --> 00:43:49,827
Are you ready to meet general Yegorov?

618
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:51,797
Of course.

619
00:43:56,276 --> 00:43:57,538
One orange juice.

620
00:44:05,252 --> 00:44:06,446
Nervous.

621
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,785
No. But this waiting.. God.

622
00:44:13,127 --> 00:44:14,321
I need a drink.

623
00:44:22,436 --> 00:44:24,529
Charlie, Yegorov is here.

624
00:45:07,815 --> 00:45:11,114
''It's getting hot.''

625
00:45:11,185 --> 00:45:14,313
''I am drinking every
shot in this party.''

626
00:45:14,388 --> 00:45:17,516
''I am feeling intoxicated.''

627
00:45:17,591 --> 00:45:21,527
''I am so knocked out, my
head is getting heavier.''

628
00:45:21,562 --> 00:45:24,725
''No, no, no.''

629
00:45:24,798 --> 00:45:28,097
''Wonder what will happen next.''

630
00:45:28,235 --> 00:45:31,204
''I am completely numb.''

631
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:32,704
''Totally drunk.''

632
00:45:32,773 --> 00:45:35,833
''I drank it neat.''

633
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:39,302
''Stop this English tune.''

634
00:45:39,379 --> 00:45:40,812
''Watch me sway.''

635
00:45:41,081 --> 00:45:44,448
''To the local beats.''

636
00:45:52,426 --> 00:45:55,623
''As the night grows.''

637
00:45:55,729 --> 00:45:58,755
''I feel intoxicated.''

638
00:45:59,032 --> 00:46:02,229
''I cannot see anything clearly.''

639
00:46:02,302 --> 00:46:05,430
''My sight is getting hazier.''

640
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:08,635
''I will sway to the fullest.''

641
00:46:08,709 --> 00:46:11,803
''I can swing to every corner.''

642
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:15,173
''Someone better stop me.''

643
00:46:15,249 --> 00:46:18,377
''Or I might kiss you.''

644
00:46:18,452 --> 00:46:21,421
''Stop this English tune.''

645
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:23,115
''Watch me sway.''

646
00:46:23,157 --> 00:46:26,684
''To the local beats.''

647
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:55,645
''Should I fill the empty glasses?''

648
00:46:55,722 --> 00:46:58,782
''I think what I should do.''

649
00:46:59,126 --> 00:47:02,118
''When I have taken the risk.''

650
00:47:02,229 --> 00:47:05,494
''So why be afraid of the world.''

651
00:47:05,566 --> 00:47:08,558
''Should I go this way or that?''

652
00:47:08,635 --> 00:47:12,036
''I don't know which way to go.''

653
00:47:12,105 --> 00:47:18,340
''You tell me how do I go
home in this condition?''

654
00:47:18,478 --> 00:47:21,641
''No, no, no.''

655
00:47:21,682 --> 00:47:24,742
''Wonder what will happen next.''

656
00:47:25,118 --> 00:47:28,053
''I am completely numb.''

657
00:47:28,121 --> 00:47:29,554
''Totally drunk.''

658
00:47:29,623 --> 00:47:32,717
''I drank it neat.''

659
00:47:33,227 --> 00:47:36,128
''Stop this English tune.''

660
00:47:36,196 --> 00:47:37,663
''Watch me sway.''

661
00:47:37,731 --> 00:47:41,258
''To the local beats.''

662
00:47:57,684 --> 00:47:59,515
Have a nice evening.

663
00:48:27,247 --> 00:48:29,112
You have to first sing me a song.

664
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:34,452
Why do Indians always
mix singing with sex?

665
00:48:34,688 --> 00:48:35,814
I've seen in your movies.

666
00:48:36,089 --> 00:48:38,421
Hero gets horny, he sings.

667
00:48:38,492 --> 00:48:41,154
Heroine gets horny, she sings.

668
00:48:41,228 --> 00:48:42,320
Always.

669
00:48:42,396 --> 00:48:44,057
So you don't like Indians.

670
00:48:46,767 --> 00:48:48,359
I didn't say that.

671
00:48:51,171 --> 00:48:54,334
We Russians like all
Raj Kapoor movies.

672
00:48:54,841 --> 00:48:58,368
I have seen 'Mera Naam Joker'.

673
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,772
'Awaara' and 'Sri 420'.

674
00:49:04,051 --> 00:49:07,214
You're lying . Prove it.
- Okay.

675
00:49:08,588 --> 00:49:12,388
''My shoes are Japanese.''

676
00:49:14,594 --> 00:49:18,428
''My pants are English.''

677
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:21,597
Thank God there is no
mention of underwear in this song.

678
00:49:22,035 --> 00:49:27,701
''The hat I am wearing is Russian.''

679
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:33,373
''But yet at heart I am an Indian.''

680
00:49:35,582 --> 00:49:37,379
Voice sample recorded.

681
00:49:41,722 --> 00:49:43,155
You are looking great.

682
00:49:54,401 --> 00:49:58,303
''My shoes are Japanese.''

683
00:49:58,672 --> 00:50:02,574
''My pants are English.''

684
00:50:04,244 --> 00:50:06,838
''The hat I am wearing is Russian.''

685
00:50:07,247 --> 00:50:09,408
''The hat I am wearing is Russian.''

686
00:50:10,617 --> 00:50:12,517
''But yet at heart I am Indian.''

687
00:50:12,586 --> 00:50:15,714
Not just your hat but
you sound Russian too.

688
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:19,190
Planning time is over.

689
00:50:21,361 --> 00:50:23,852
Players, let's go for the gold.

690
00:50:48,422 --> 00:50:50,356
Yegorov's driver is
approaching with the car.

691
00:50:55,462 --> 00:50:56,451
Now.

692
00:51:01,134 --> 00:51:02,294
The spikes have done their job.

693
00:51:03,637 --> 00:51:05,127
Now you fix your flat tyre.

694
00:51:05,205 --> 00:51:07,139
And our man will pick up Yegorov.

695
00:51:08,075 --> 00:51:12,375
Sunny, it's your turn.
- Okay.

696
00:51:56,456 --> 00:51:58,048
Goodbye.

697
00:51:58,825 --> 00:52:02,192
Sleep peacefully for
the next 24 hours.

698
00:52:18,311 --> 00:52:19,676
Wow. Great.

699
00:52:22,349 --> 00:52:24,408
Okay.
- Perfect.

700
00:52:24,551 --> 00:52:26,212
Even his father cannot recognize you..

701
00:52:26,286 --> 00:52:28,083
..otherwise my name isn't Sunny Mehra.

702
00:52:34,694 --> 00:52:36,753
Good luck, Charlie.
- Thanks.

703
00:52:51,778 --> 00:52:53,473
Go, get that file.

704
00:53:04,524 --> 00:53:06,515
Not this one, the red one.

705
00:53:14,768 --> 00:53:16,326
Yes, sir, General.

706
00:53:56,209 --> 00:53:57,369
Look after Yugorov.

707
00:53:57,444 --> 00:53:59,537
Forget him and
concentrate on your work.

708
00:53:59,613 --> 00:54:00,705
Stop joking.

709
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:03,112
Sunny, be in place at the right time.

710
00:54:03,149 --> 00:54:04,446
Okay?
- Okay.

711
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:34,246
Go check the carriages, immediately.
- Okay, sir.

712
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:47,319
The camera's in place.

713
00:54:48,261 --> 00:54:49,455
Great, Charlie.

714
00:54:49,529 --> 00:54:51,190
Time to put up the flags.

715
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,070
This is the symbol of friendship..

716
00:55:09,149 --> 00:55:10,639
..between Russia and Romania

717
00:55:19,793 --> 00:55:22,193
Crew, about turn.

718
00:55:49,622 --> 00:55:51,180
015.

719
00:55:51,257 --> 00:55:53,225
920.

720
00:55:54,294 --> 00:55:55,386
61.

721
00:55:55,528 --> 00:55:56,790
03.

722
00:55:57,530 --> 00:55:58,690
58.

723
00:55:59,566 --> 00:56:00,760
Great.
- Yeah.

724
00:56:32,532 --> 00:56:35,695
Hello.
- Ronnie, the gold train has departed.

725
00:56:35,769 --> 00:56:37,259
Let's get ready.

726
00:57:27,554 --> 00:57:28,646
Alright, guys.

727
00:57:28,721 --> 00:57:30,746
I am activating the boosters.

728
00:57:59,752 --> 00:58:01,242
Guys, Tunnel spotted.

729
00:58:01,321 --> 00:58:02,788
I can see the tunnel.

730
00:58:09,128 --> 00:58:11,619
Ronnie, the gold train is
about to enter the tunnel.

731
00:58:11,698 --> 00:58:13,029
Okay.

732
00:58:13,266 --> 00:58:16,599
Ronnie, now everything
depends on your illusion.

733
00:59:08,121 --> 00:59:09,679
Spider, your turn.

734
00:59:16,396 --> 00:59:19,024
Ladies and Gentlemen,
sorry for the interruption.

735
00:59:25,038 --> 00:59:26,232
Oh no.

736
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,235
What's wrong?
- I don't know.

737
00:59:29,275 --> 00:59:30,435
Just check, man.

738
00:59:32,612 --> 00:59:34,443
Your time starts now.

739
00:59:35,415 --> 00:59:37,280
We have 10 minutes.

740
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:39,818
Buckle up, guys. I am
increasing the speed.

741
00:59:48,161 --> 00:59:49,685
Any result?

742
00:59:49,729 --> 00:59:52,220
Sir, system has crashed.
- What?

743
00:59:52,298 --> 00:59:53,731
Call the engineer, fast!

744
00:59:58,438 --> 01:00:00,406
Guys, I can see the train.

745
01:00:51,858 --> 01:00:53,291
The illusion is working.

746
01:00:53,326 --> 01:00:55,294
They cannot see our train.

747
01:01:06,305 --> 01:01:07,636
Good job.

748
01:01:16,416 --> 01:01:18,680
What happened?
- We lost connection.

749
01:02:10,136 --> 01:02:11,364
Spidey, what is the code?

750
01:02:12,505 --> 01:02:14,063
0159.

751
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:16,165
0159.

752
01:02:16,242 --> 01:02:17,436
2061.

753
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:19,535
20.
- 061.

754
01:02:19,612 --> 01:02:22,740
61.. next.

755
01:02:22,815 --> 01:02:26,717
0358.
- 0358.

756
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:28,310
That's it
- Yeah.

757
01:02:36,496 --> 01:02:38,327
Let's get him.
- Stop!

758
01:03:01,287 --> 01:03:02,413
Yes, sir.

759
01:03:02,488 --> 01:03:04,217
Is anything wrong there?

760
01:03:05,691 --> 01:03:07,158
Everything's okay.

761
01:03:24,777 --> 01:03:26,335
Four minutes.

762
01:03:36,255 --> 01:03:37,449
Ronnie.

763
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:41,285
What happened?

764
01:03:41,427 --> 01:03:43,327
There's a problem with the illusion.
- What?

765
01:03:53,239 --> 01:03:54,831
I've rewinded the video.

766
01:04:14,327 --> 01:04:15,692
Charlie, we're losing time.

767
01:05:03,476 --> 01:05:05,808
Players, Jackpot.

768
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:09,445
Yes, we did it.

769
01:05:09,715 --> 01:05:11,410
Love you, Charlie.

770
01:05:55,127 --> 01:05:57,095
Soon we will
reconnect with the satellite.

771
01:06:32,131 --> 01:06:33,598
Bilal, watch out.

772
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:49,839
How will we transfer
rest of the gold now?

773
01:06:50,783 --> 01:06:52,580
Guys, we have just one minute.

774
01:06:52,651 --> 01:06:54,710
And the system will
restart in one minute.

775
01:07:16,509 --> 01:07:19,307
Diversion coming up,
hurry up, Charlie.

776
01:07:21,614 --> 01:07:23,741
Their satellite system
can restart any minute.

777
01:07:29,055 --> 01:07:30,454
Come on, Charlie, hurry up.

778
01:07:32,658 --> 01:07:34,148
Come on.

779
01:07:38,764 --> 01:07:40,231
Come on, Charlie,

780
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:43,830
Hurry up.
- Forget the gold bar and jump.

781
01:07:44,103 --> 01:07:45,365
Come on, Charlie.

782
01:07:51,744 --> 01:07:53,769
Take my hand.

783
01:08:12,098 --> 01:08:13,497
Yes. We made it.

784
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:15,226
Thank you, friend.

785
01:08:15,301 --> 01:08:17,201
Come on. Get back to your positions.
Everything is fine.

786
01:09:02,414 --> 01:09:06,407
Sir, I will keep visiting you.
- Yes, why not? Why not?

787
01:09:39,418 --> 01:09:41,079
I missed you, papa.

788
01:09:41,353 --> 01:09:42,786
I really missed you.

789
01:09:47,159 --> 01:09:49,593
What will you do with your share?

790
01:09:49,662 --> 01:09:51,095
I will buy this.

791
01:09:51,163 --> 01:09:53,097
My dream mansion in Wellington.

792
01:09:53,165 --> 01:09:54,427
It's being auctioned next week.

793
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:57,094
Starting bid is 10 million dollars.

794
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:01,506
Charlie, you shouldn't have taken
such a big risk for one gold bar.

795
01:10:01,807 --> 01:10:04,139
Ronnie, I promised Victor..

796
01:10:04,476 --> 01:10:06,842
..I will pay him to the last gram.

797
01:10:09,682 --> 01:10:13,618
How lovely, dear. I missed
you and this house so much..

798
01:10:13,686 --> 01:10:15,347
..in the past 10 years.

799
01:10:15,421 --> 01:10:18,288
So better understand the
rules of this house as well.

800
01:10:18,357 --> 01:10:22,453
If you want to talk or
meet someone, only through me.

801
01:10:22,528 --> 01:10:23,722
Okay.

802
01:10:34,306 --> 01:10:36,365
Just eat, that's my order.

803
01:10:36,642 --> 01:10:37,768
Okay.

804
01:10:42,881 --> 01:10:44,576
Hello.
- We did it.

805
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:46,208
What did I say, papa?

806
01:10:46,285 --> 01:10:49,550
The largest robbery of the century.

807
01:10:50,422 --> 01:10:52,447
1biliion.

808
01:10:52,758 --> 01:10:54,316
1biliion.

809
01:10:56,862 --> 01:10:58,693
Now your dream will be fulfilled.

810
01:10:59,398 --> 01:11:01,093
I am so happy.

811
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,561
I wish you were here with us.

812
01:11:10,175 --> 01:11:13,804
Naina, I..
- No, papa. No need to say anything.

813
01:11:14,146 --> 01:11:16,273
I just asked for one thing.

814
01:11:16,315 --> 01:11:17,373
Just one promise.

815
01:11:17,449 --> 01:11:19,246
That you won't do anything wrong.

816
01:11:19,318 --> 01:11:22,116
And you broke that. Just for money.

817
01:11:22,187 --> 01:11:25,281
No, Naina, I didn't do this
for money. - Papa, stop lying.

818
01:11:25,357 --> 01:11:26,756
Papa, for the past 10 years..

819
01:11:26,825 --> 01:11:30,659
..I stayed away from you just so
that you don't do anything wrong.

820
01:11:31,297 --> 01:11:33,424
But maybe you don't
love your daughter.

821
01:11:33,499 --> 01:11:35,763
Give me a chance,
Naina, let me explain.

822
01:11:38,537 --> 01:11:41,097
Alright, to success.

823
01:11:41,173 --> 01:11:42,640
To the best team in the world.

824
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:45,370
To Charlie. The best
player in the world.

825
01:11:45,577 --> 01:11:47,408
Bilal Basheer.

826
01:11:47,479 --> 01:11:50,414
You have an opportunity to tell us..

827
01:11:50,482 --> 01:11:53,508
..what you will do
with this 100 million.

828
01:11:53,585 --> 01:11:55,883
I will buy cars worth 50 million.

829
01:11:57,156 --> 01:11:59,681
Latest, vintage. Every model.

830
01:11:59,758 --> 01:12:02,192
The rest of the money?
- Who will fill petrol in those cars?

831
01:12:02,227 --> 01:12:03,216
Your father?

832
01:12:03,829 --> 01:12:07,265
My father won't have time
for these useless things.

833
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:10,393
Because he will now
open a production house.

834
01:12:10,703 --> 01:12:15,163
Hazurilal Mehra
presents Sunny the Superstar.

835
01:12:16,542 --> 01:12:19,375
Mr. Magician. Will you
tell us something today..

836
01:12:19,445 --> 01:12:21,709
..or prefer to keep silent.

837
01:12:22,314 --> 01:12:25,283
No, I can tell you today.
- Then tell us.

838
01:12:26,218 --> 01:12:27,515
I will build a house.

839
01:12:28,821 --> 01:12:33,121
A house that has all the
luxuries of the world.

840
01:12:34,126 --> 01:12:35,821
Where everything's done automatically.

841
01:12:36,562 --> 01:12:37,859
At a single call.

842
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:40,428
You could have done that
with your magic as well.

843
01:12:43,135 --> 01:12:44,602
Magic doesn't do anything.

844
01:12:46,138 --> 01:12:47,833
It only ruins lives.

845
01:12:52,811 --> 01:12:54,403
'Papa.'

846
01:12:59,284 --> 01:13:01,343
'Gudiya!'

847
01:13:03,055 --> 01:13:06,718
My daughter was paralyzed
forever because of my illusion.

848
01:13:08,193 --> 01:13:09,524
She cannot even move.

849
01:13:10,262 --> 01:13:12,753
But I want to give her all
the happiness of the world.

850
01:13:14,533 --> 01:13:16,364
Everything she commands is done.

851
01:13:16,769 --> 01:13:19,499
She never feels that
she cannot do anything.

852
01:13:21,106 --> 01:13:23,267
That will be my biggest magic trick.

853
01:13:26,445 --> 01:13:28,379
Ronnie, I hope you can buy
every happiness for her..

854
01:13:28,447 --> 01:13:29,675
..with this money.

855
01:13:36,422 --> 01:13:37,650
I sure will.

856
01:13:40,592 --> 01:13:42,560
And if this money isn't adequate..

857
01:14:28,307 --> 01:14:30,104
You rascal.

858
01:14:57,402 --> 01:14:58,767
Who are they?

859
01:14:59,471 --> 01:15:02,634
Whose men are they? You must know.

860
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:06,109
After all, you're the
best player in the world.

861
01:15:07,279 --> 01:15:08,507
Oh, come on, Charlie.

862
01:15:09,281 --> 01:15:11,681
These poor guys, I mean..

863
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:14,685
..don't break the hearts of
the best team in the world.

864
01:15:15,187 --> 01:15:19,055
Please tell them their
Shaila has a big heart.

865
01:15:20,092 --> 01:15:23,493
And she shares it with others..

866
01:15:24,296 --> 01:15:26,389
..just like her husband's secrets.

867
01:15:26,598 --> 01:15:28,463
'And I told you that..'

868
01:15:28,834 --> 01:15:30,802
'..if anything happens to me
send that parcel to Charlie.'

869
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:35,802
'Pure Romanian Gold. Which is worth..'

870
01:15:36,642 --> 01:15:38,667
'..decent people like us.'

871
01:15:39,411 --> 01:15:40,673
And tell them that you knew..

872
01:15:40,746 --> 01:15:43,180
..you weren't the only
one at Raj's funeral.

873
01:15:44,316 --> 01:15:45,442
I was there too.

874
01:15:49,321 --> 01:15:50,549
And one more thing.

875
01:15:50,856 --> 01:15:53,552
A hacker whom no one
could trace in the world..

876
01:15:53,725 --> 01:15:55,625
..but you just caught
him sitting in your dorm.

877
01:15:55,694 --> 01:15:56,854
Just like that.

878
01:15:57,095 --> 01:16:00,155
And no one felt anything suspicious.

879
01:16:04,469 --> 01:16:08,235
You didn't find me. I
told you my whereabouts.

880
01:16:09,107 --> 01:16:10,597
'Where are you going
without making the delivery?'

881
01:16:10,676 --> 01:16:12,769
You thought you are after me.

882
01:16:13,378 --> 01:16:17,109
But no, I was ahead of you..

883
01:16:18,083 --> 01:16:21,746
..always a step ahead.

884
01:16:22,554 --> 01:16:25,045
Yes, for a moment I felt that..

885
01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:29,187
..you will keep some
cards to yourself.

886
01:16:30,128 --> 01:16:32,494
'You will know the exit
plan at the right time.'

887
01:16:32,564 --> 01:16:38,525
But then you gave me the
exit plan on a platter.

888
01:16:39,504 --> 01:16:42,337
'Victor has sent the exit plan,
check it. - Right.'

889
01:16:42,407 --> 01:16:46,173
I just slightly
changed that exit plan.

890
01:16:47,145 --> 01:16:50,603
This place isn't
according to Victor's exit plan.

891
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:53,350
It's according to my exit plan.

892
01:16:54,753 --> 01:16:57,244
My place, my men.

893
01:16:57,489 --> 01:17:01,016
And some 30 kilometers away
from here your Victor's men..

894
01:17:01,059 --> 01:17:05,519
..would be dancing around
in the snow with their guns.

895
01:17:07,799 --> 01:17:10,734
So come on, Charlie,
the master planner.

896
01:17:11,236 --> 01:17:14,262
Please tell me that you knew this.

897
01:17:14,539 --> 01:17:15,631
No.

898
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:20,704
But I knew that I
can pull off this job.

899
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:25,744
With my intelligence,
and the courage of my team.

900
01:17:26,685 --> 01:17:28,346
And I did it.

901
01:17:29,721 --> 01:17:33,122
And you knew that you
can't pull off this job.

902
01:17:34,259 --> 01:17:37,387
You had just one way to get the gold.

903
01:17:38,664 --> 01:17:39,790
Deceit.

904
01:17:40,532 --> 01:17:41,760
Hey, Spider.

905
01:17:42,834 --> 01:17:45,064
You can do anything you want with us.

906
01:17:45,837 --> 01:17:50,740
But remember, Victor won't spare you.

907
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:54,471
I admit that I am the
villain of this story.

908
01:17:55,347 --> 01:17:58,373
But my brother, you
should give me some credit.

909
01:17:58,684 --> 01:18:01,482
I must have thought
something about it.

910
01:18:01,787 --> 01:18:04,449
'For the past 10 years I
stayed away from you..'

911
01:18:04,523 --> 01:18:07,014
'..just so that you
don't do anything wrong.'

912
01:18:07,092 --> 01:18:09,322
'But maybe you don't
love your daughter.'

913
01:18:09,795 --> 01:18:11,126
'Naina.'

914
01:18:17,235 --> 01:18:18,429
'Dear, stay inside.'

915
01:18:18,503 --> 01:18:19,765
'Stay inside.'

916
01:18:20,038 --> 01:18:22,472
'Papa. Papa.'

917
01:19:51,363 --> 01:19:52,796
I am really sad, Charlie.

918
01:19:53,398 --> 01:19:57,698
You lost your Guru, friend
and love in a single day.

919
01:19:59,204 --> 01:20:01,172
Do you still want to live?

920
01:20:47,619 --> 01:20:49,610
Ronnie, Ronnie.

921
01:21:00,832 --> 01:21:03,266
You get the gold, and I will get Riya.

922
01:21:48,446 --> 01:21:49,879
Bye-bye.

923
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:56,733
Naina, I.. - ''I am sorry'',
isn't that what you want to say.

924
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:58,670
Naina, listen to me.
- Why should I?

925
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:00,605
And what else should
I forgive you for?

926
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:02,506
For the fact that for
the past ten years..

927
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:03,976
..you are posing as my father's CA.

928
01:23:04,212 --> 01:23:06,442
Or for that fact that my
father broke his promise..

929
01:23:06,515 --> 01:23:07,880
..for the greed you gave him.

930
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:09,883
Naina, I am very close to Spider.

931
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:12,284
How many times will you
try to explain to me..

932
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:13,649
..that Spider killed papa?

933
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:17,851
He shot him but you threw
him in front of the barrel.

934
01:23:17,926 --> 01:23:19,860
You killed him, Charlie.
- Naina.

935
01:23:19,961 --> 01:23:21,360
And what I regret is that..

936
01:23:21,463 --> 01:23:24,455
..my father agreed just for
some money.. - Enough, Naina.

937
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:28,828
I have no regrets that
you misunderstood me..

938
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:34,739
..but I really regret that
you misunderstood Victor.

939
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:38,368
He didn't break your
promise for money..

940
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:40,714
..but for his dream.

941
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:44,944
His dream to build
India's biggest orphanage.

942
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:48,746
So that no child can
become Victor or Charlie again.

943
01:23:50,559 --> 01:23:52,288
And trust me, Naina.

944
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:55,921
I will fulfill this dream.

945
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:04,861
'Sorry, dear. I
broke my promise to you.'

946
01:24:05,741 --> 01:24:07,936
'I wanted to do something.. '

947
01:24:08,577 --> 01:24:13,810
'.. so that you feel proud
whenever you think of me.'

948
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:16,411
'Feel proud, dear.'

949
01:24:40,776 --> 01:24:43,006
Your dream will surely be fulfilled.

950
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:45,970
You will not fulfill
my papa's dream alone.

951
01:24:55,524 --> 01:24:57,515
One more thing, Charlie Mascahernas.

952
01:24:57,626 --> 01:25:00,891
I will make Charlie pay for
the gold and papa's death.

953
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:04,331
Till the last gram.

954
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:15,538
Look.. Victor is back.

955
01:25:23,318 --> 01:25:25,912
Here are our passports,
visas and other documents.

956
01:25:26,555 --> 01:25:27,852
Where are we going?

957
01:25:28,356 --> 01:25:29,550
New Zealand.

958
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:32,622
That's where we will
find a clue to catch Spider.

959
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:37,454
Remember this.

960
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:41,264
This is the last gold bar
that I picked up from the train.

961
01:25:42,771 --> 01:25:45,763
For the past one year I
have been traveling around..

962
01:25:45,841 --> 01:25:47,968
..to all the gold
markets in the world..

963
01:25:48,276 --> 01:25:51,370
..with a hope to find a
dealer who can get me..

964
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:55,246
..a similar Romanian gold bar.

965
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:56,840
I found a dealer in Auckland.

966
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:58,317
'How many do you want? '

967
01:25:58,420 --> 01:25:59,717
'How many can you find? '

968
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:00,845
'Give me a week.'

969
01:26:00,956 --> 01:26:02,685
'You call when ready, my
boss will be here for the deal.'

970
01:26:02,724 --> 01:26:03,850
'Okay?
- Okay.'

971
01:26:03,959 --> 01:26:06,894
And two days ago that dealer called.

972
01:26:07,696 --> 01:26:08,958
He wants to meet.

973
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:49,496
Hello.

974
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:52,564
Yes, we have reached Auckland.

975
01:26:52,641 --> 01:26:54,575
We should meet today and do the deal.

976
01:26:55,477 --> 01:26:57,342
Yes, my boss is also with me.

977
01:26:57,445 --> 01:26:58,537
Okay.

978
01:26:59,281 --> 01:27:00,771
Who is the boss?

979
01:27:01,349 --> 01:27:02,907
Come, I will show you who the boss is.

980
01:27:03,752 --> 01:27:05,481
Do you know who the boss is?

981
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:48,961
This is my boss, Mr. Zhaveri Bazaar.

982
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:50,697
A well-known gold dealer in India.

983
01:27:50,799 --> 01:27:52,528
Nice to meet you, Mr. Bazaar.

984
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:02,201
So, Mr. Bazaar, how many
gold bars would you like to buy?

985
01:28:23,932 --> 01:28:25,297
One?

986
01:28:26,468 --> 01:28:27,696
One hundred?

987
01:28:28,703 --> 01:28:29,863
One thousand?

988
01:28:31,706 --> 01:28:35,233
But my price, $40,000 per bar.

989
01:28:46,254 --> 01:28:48,381
I got it. No problem.

990
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:50,856
Boss wants to speak to the
astrologer before the big deal.

991
01:28:50,925 --> 01:28:52,256
We're Indians, see.

992
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:54,692
Yes, yes, Indians
very religious people.

993
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:03,827
Hello.
- The microchip is working, Charlie.

994
01:29:03,905 --> 01:29:06,271
Yes, it's an auspicious phase.

995
01:29:06,608 --> 01:29:08,508
Let's go, the job's done.

996
01:29:09,878 --> 01:29:11,812
The deal is.. on.

997
01:29:18,653 --> 01:29:20,484
Boss likes to shake
hands when the deal's done.

998
01:29:20,588 --> 01:29:21,714
Oh yes, thank you.

999
01:29:21,790 --> 01:29:22,848
What a stalwart, sir.

1000
01:29:22,924 --> 01:29:24,585
You made a deal
without saying a single word.

1001
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:25,785
What a personality?

1002
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:28,226
My ears were yearning
to hear those words.

1003
01:29:28,296 --> 01:29:29,763
I struggled for 15 years.

1004
01:29:29,798 --> 01:29:32,858
Finally I found someone
who understood my true worth.

1005
01:29:32,967 --> 01:29:36,334
Otherwise people would
shoo me away like a stray dog.

1006
01:29:36,938 --> 01:29:38,599
Boss very happy deal done.

1007
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:39,800
Thank you.

1008
01:29:40,642 --> 01:29:42,303
This way.

1009
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:48,376
Indians. Very religious, very crazy.

1010
01:29:50,819 --> 01:29:52,446
Good one my Zhaveri Bazaar.

1011
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,283
You acted well.

1012
01:29:54,355 --> 01:29:56,619
Now you realized
what a good actor I am.

1013
01:29:57,258 --> 01:29:59,556
But the credit for this
acting goes to the director.

1014
01:30:00,662 --> 01:30:01,788
Not bad.

1015
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,561
How long have you been doing this?

1016
01:30:03,898 --> 01:30:05,331
Seven years.

1017
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,628
For seven years?

1018
01:30:07,502 --> 01:30:10,733
Since I was seven years old.
- Really.

1019
01:30:16,211 --> 01:30:17,803
The dealer's call is being traced.

1020
01:30:17,879 --> 01:30:19,369
Pick it up, please.

1021
01:30:20,381 --> 01:30:22,474
Hello. How are you?
- That's him.

1022
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:24,176
That's Spider. Trace it.

1023
01:30:24,285 --> 01:30:25,411
I am good, sir.

1024
01:30:25,487 --> 01:30:27,614
This time I've got a
really big order for you.

1025
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:29,184
How big?

1026
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:30,349
The signal's coming from Singapore.

1027
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:31,790
That means Spider is in Singapore.

1028
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:33,350
It's a 1000 bars.

1029
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:35,487
1000 bars? Who is the buyer?

1030
01:30:35,597 --> 01:30:36,723
And now it's Mexico.

1031
01:30:36,831 --> 01:30:38,389
He's bouncing his signal.

1032
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,491
They're Indians, sir.
- Indians?

1033
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:42,866
New Zealand. Spider is
right here in New Zealand.

1034
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:44,370
Really rich man.

1035
01:30:44,739 --> 01:30:45,797
It's confirmed order, Sir.

1036
01:30:45,907 --> 01:30:47,966
Wellington. He's in Wellington.

1037
01:30:48,243 --> 01:30:51,212
Ten more seconds and I can
confirm his exact location.

1038
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:52,337
It's a confirmed order.

1039
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:53,744
You checked their backgrounds.

1040
01:30:57,719 --> 01:30:59,482
Five seconds.
- No, Sir.

1041
01:30:59,554 --> 01:31:01,317
What? You moron.

1042
01:31:01,422 --> 01:31:02,548
Three seconds.

1043
01:31:02,624 --> 01:31:03,784
But, sir..

1044
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:09,621
Couldn't he talk for
three more seconds?

1045
01:31:09,697 --> 01:31:11,358
At least we know that
Spider is in Wellington.

1046
01:31:11,399 --> 01:31:12,491
What good is that?

1047
01:31:12,567 --> 01:31:15,263
Where will we look for him
in this huge Wellington city?

1048
01:31:15,336 --> 01:31:16,633
Sunny is right.

1049
01:31:17,605 --> 01:31:19,232
We need a clue.

1050
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:21,366
And we will find that
clue here in Auckland.

1051
01:31:21,843 --> 01:31:24,869
Naina, you and I will
raid the dealer's warehouse.

1052
01:31:24,946 --> 01:31:26,743
And we? What will we do?

1053
01:31:26,915 --> 01:31:30,908
You two will do what
you two always do.

1054
01:31:34,956 --> 01:31:39,655
Rascal. I won't spare you.

1055
01:31:39,727 --> 01:31:40,751
Say it louder.

1056
01:31:40,862 --> 01:31:42,625
Rascal!

1057
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:44,291
Silent.

1058
01:31:44,599 --> 01:31:47,568
What burns turns to ember.
What die down are ashes.

1059
01:31:47,635 --> 01:31:51,366
And one who can make those
ashes blowup is called Bilal.

1060
01:31:52,373 --> 01:31:53,897
Control yourself.

1061
01:31:53,975 --> 01:31:56,409
Because today if this
Sikh loses his mind..

1062
01:31:56,811 --> 01:31:58,335
..he'll take down many with him.

1063
01:31:58,413 --> 01:31:59,675
Who are you?

1064
01:31:59,781 --> 01:32:01,442
I am India. He's Pakistan.

1065
01:32:01,549 --> 01:32:03,346
And we are fighting, like always.

1066
01:32:03,685 --> 01:32:04,947
But why?

1067
01:32:06,221 --> 01:32:07,745
When for the last 60
years we never understood..

1068
01:32:07,856 --> 01:32:10,450
..why we are fighting
then how can you understand.

1069
01:32:10,558 --> 01:32:11,889
Isn't it?
- Nice.

1070
01:32:16,798 --> 01:32:22,327
You're taking this joke seriously.
- Let's go.

1071
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:33,404
There are at least 150 entries.

1072
01:32:33,481 --> 01:32:34,914
Check for deliveries in Wellington.

1073
01:32:34,983 --> 01:32:36,814
Spider's gold comes from there.

1074
01:32:38,987 --> 01:32:40,477
Quick.

1075
01:32:40,588 --> 01:32:41,919
There are five entries for Wellington.

1076
01:32:42,023 --> 01:32:43,320
And this is the only entry that..

1077
01:32:43,424 --> 01:32:44,891
..doesn't have the name
and address of the supplier..

1078
01:32:44,959 --> 01:32:46,017
..but the date and time.

1079
01:32:46,294 --> 01:32:48,262
This must be Spider's delivery.
- Yes.

1080
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:50,763
Check the footage for
the date and time on this.

1081
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:56,362
Rewind it.

1082
01:33:01,276 --> 01:33:02,334
Stop.

1083
01:33:03,378 --> 01:33:04,504
Play.

1084
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:14,685
That's some girl, Charlie.

1085
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:24,398
Someone up there.

1086
01:33:24,666 --> 01:33:26,600
Zoom on the number plate of this car.

1087
01:33:29,404 --> 01:33:30,632
Write it down.

1088
01:33:30,705 --> 01:33:33,265
DZG298.

1089
01:33:40,548 --> 01:33:41,776
We are reaching Wellington.

1090
01:33:41,849 --> 01:33:44,875
Thanks for the information.
I will see you at the castle.

1091
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:46,477
Alright, thanks.

1092
01:33:47,522 --> 01:33:48,784
You were right, Charlie.

1093
01:33:48,856 --> 01:33:50,517
The registration
number was of Wellington.

1094
01:33:50,858 --> 01:33:51,916
By tomorrow we will have
the name and address..

1095
01:33:51,993 --> 01:33:53,392
..of that car owner.

1096
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:06,603
Here's the address.
- Alright, thanks.

1097
01:34:12,246 --> 01:34:15,340
Charlie, I got the
address of that girl.

1098
01:34:15,717 --> 01:34:16,843
Maybe she's the one who
came to make the delivery..

1099
01:34:16,884 --> 01:34:18,215
..at the gold dealer.

1100
01:34:18,286 --> 01:34:19,583
Her name is Pamela.

1101
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:51,248
Oh no, check-post.

1102
01:34:52,653 --> 01:34:54,917
Where did this car come from?

1103
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:00,723
By the time we cross this check-post..

1104
01:35:00,795 --> 01:35:02,387
..we will surely lose her.

1105
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:14,765
Excuse me, officer.
- Yes.

1106
01:35:14,842 --> 01:35:16,935
Is there a problem,
we're in a bit of a hurry.

1107
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:18,473
There has been a theft at the museum.

1108
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:19,672
We are checking every car.

1109
01:35:20,615 --> 01:35:22,640
Charlie, she is gone.

1110
01:35:23,785 --> 01:35:25,412
Open your boot.

1111
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,720
Naina.

1112
01:35:34,996 --> 01:35:36,725
What the.. She was right here.

1113
01:35:37,331 --> 01:35:38,559
Where did she go?

1114
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:43,664
So, where is it going to be?

1115
01:35:43,938 --> 01:35:46,236
Your place or mine?

1116
01:35:48,309 --> 01:35:51,403
Take right.
- Oh, your place.

1117
01:35:58,653 --> 01:35:59,779
Stop.

1118
01:36:03,458 --> 01:36:05,426
Here? We're going to do it here?

1119
01:36:05,827 --> 01:36:07,454
In your dreams, baby.

1120
01:36:10,198 --> 01:36:11,426
What the..

1121
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:21,207
Hello.
- Naina, where are you?

1122
01:36:21,509 --> 01:36:25,377
Right in front of Spider's web.

1123
01:36:33,921 --> 01:36:36,515
The rascal has
bought such a huge palace.

1124
01:36:36,591 --> 01:36:38,684
Did he sell all the gold?

1125
01:36:38,793 --> 01:36:39,817
Impossible.

1126
01:36:40,361 --> 01:36:41,658
Spider is selling only so much..

1127
01:36:41,729 --> 01:36:42,855
..that doesn't
attract the Russian mafia..

1128
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:45,831
..or the Russian government.
- Correct.

1129
01:36:46,567 --> 01:36:50,663
Bilal, can you arrange
for an x-ray scanner..

1130
01:36:50,738 --> 01:36:55,266
..which can detect the where
the gold is in the castle.

1131
01:36:55,710 --> 01:36:56,938
I can make that.

1132
01:36:57,612 --> 01:36:59,807
But who will make
the software to run it?

1133
01:37:01,916 --> 01:37:04,350
Am I Mr. India, do I look invisible?

1134
01:37:04,452 --> 01:37:06,352
How could we forget?

1135
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:09,821
If she can find Spider then she
can find Spider's gold as well.

1136
01:37:09,891 --> 01:37:11,415
Isn't it, Charlie?

1137
01:37:19,934 --> 01:37:22,459
He's surely getting
his birthday gift today.

1138
01:37:22,537 --> 01:37:24,903
Just get her a few drinks
and have the fun of your life.

1139
01:37:24,972 --> 01:37:26,337
Boys aren't the only
one who take advantage..

1140
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:28,670
..sometimes girls do too.

1141
01:37:29,377 --> 01:37:31,504
What do you mean?
- Nothing, just..

1142
01:37:31,979 --> 01:37:35,210
..speaking from personal experience.

1143
01:37:35,283 --> 01:37:36,807
Who are you talking about?

1144
01:37:40,955 --> 01:37:43,651
On the evening of
your birthday, did I..

1145
01:37:43,758 --> 01:37:45,282
Forget it, Naina, let it be.

1146
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:46,690
Tell me, Charlie.

1147
01:37:51,232 --> 01:37:52,631
Just that..

1148
01:37:54,635 --> 01:37:57,502
..you held my hand
and pulled me closer.

1149
01:37:58,306 --> 01:38:02,902
After that.. I stared
in your eyes and said..

1150
01:38:03,778 --> 01:38:08,306
..I love you.. Riya.
- What?

1151
01:38:20,828 --> 01:38:22,352
Bilal.
- What happened?

1152
01:38:22,463 --> 01:38:24,931
I just saw Riya on this market's CCTV.

1153
01:38:25,233 --> 01:38:26,564
Riya?
- Yes, Riya.

1154
01:38:26,667 --> 01:38:27,725
What? Are you sure it was Riya?

1155
01:38:27,802 --> 01:38:28,860
I am sure.

1156
01:38:33,307 --> 01:38:35,400
This is the shop
where Riya was standing.

1157
01:38:39,747 --> 01:38:40,941
There's Riya.

1158
01:40:11,439 --> 01:40:13,407
After your car crash..

1159
01:40:13,441 --> 01:40:15,671
..spider and his men left from there.

1160
01:40:17,345 --> 01:40:21,543
And.. they left me
there thinking I was dead.

1161
01:40:26,821 --> 01:40:28,948
I thought everything's over.

1162
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:31,785
And I wanted to finish myself as well.

1163
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:34,725
But God had other plans.

1164
01:40:35,896 --> 01:40:39,263
I had just one motive in life.

1165
01:40:40,668 --> 01:40:42,226
Revenge from Spider.

1166
01:40:43,204 --> 01:40:45,263
That's why I came to
Wellington looking for him.

1167
01:40:45,606 --> 01:40:49,440
But, Riya, it took us
so long to find Spider.

1168
01:40:50,311 --> 01:40:51,869
How did you find him all alone?

1169
01:40:53,214 --> 01:40:57,776
The grand villa Spider
lives in was my choice.

1170
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:00,653
'My dream mansion in Wellington.'

1171
01:41:00,721 --> 01:41:02,188
'It's being auctioned next week.'

1172
01:41:02,256 --> 01:41:04,315
'Starting bid is 10 million dollars.

1173
01:41:04,392 --> 01:41:07,555
'Maybe someone will
bid higher than you.'

1174
01:41:07,928 --> 01:41:10,328
My doubts were
confirmed when I came here.

1175
01:41:11,599 --> 01:41:13,590
He really did buy that mansion.

1176
01:41:13,834 --> 01:41:15,802
I was in the truck as well.

1177
01:41:15,870 --> 01:41:18,737
Then why didn't I think of it as well.

1178
01:41:18,806 --> 01:41:20,501
It's no use, Sunny.

1179
01:41:21,242 --> 01:41:23,608
Spider lives amongst hi-tech security.

1180
01:41:24,478 --> 01:41:26,571
That's why even I
couldn't do anything until now.

1181
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:36,379
You will now do what you
couldn't do until now.

1182
01:41:37,425 --> 01:41:39,450
Because you are no longer alone, Riya.

1183
01:42:07,455 --> 01:42:10,219
This device can detect
gold kept inside, Charlie.

1184
01:42:10,558 --> 01:42:13,891
But for that we will have
to take it over the gold.

1185
01:42:14,361 --> 01:42:17,296
That means we will have to
get inside Spider's villa.

1186
01:42:17,364 --> 01:42:18,729
But how will we do that?

1187
01:42:18,799 --> 01:42:20,266
It's possible.

1188
01:42:20,334 --> 01:42:21,926
Spider calls a new girl every night..

1189
01:42:22,236 --> 01:42:24,466
..from different
night clubs in the city.

1190
01:42:24,538 --> 01:42:25,971
Sometimes Chinese, sometime Italian..

1191
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:27,468
..or sometimes Turkish.

1192
01:42:27,575 --> 01:42:30,237
I had a Brazilian waiter friend.

1193
01:42:30,344 --> 01:42:32,278
Spider had called her as well.

1194
01:42:32,379 --> 01:42:33,437
That's how I know.

1195
01:42:33,547 --> 01:42:37,643
That means we will have to
arrange for a girl. - No.

1196
01:42:38,452 --> 01:42:39,749
This is Spider's city.

1197
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:41,783
We cannot trust anyone.

1198
01:42:42,556 --> 01:42:43,784
I will go.

1199
01:42:46,427 --> 01:42:47,485
I am the only one in this group..

1200
01:42:47,595 --> 01:42:49,324
..whom Spider doesn't recognize.

1201
01:42:49,396 --> 01:42:51,364
And you don't know Spider.

1202
01:42:51,432 --> 01:42:53,024
That's why you are being naÃ¯ve.

1203
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:54,961
I know what I am saying.

1204
01:42:55,269 --> 01:42:57,794
If you have a better
alternative then let's hear it..

1205
01:42:57,905 --> 01:43:00,430
..if you don't then
just stay out of it.

1206
01:43:09,283 --> 01:43:10,750
Riya is right, Naina.

1207
01:43:11,218 --> 01:43:12,742
It is not an easy job.

1208
01:43:13,687 --> 01:43:14,949
Don't take it personally.

1209
01:43:15,523 --> 01:43:16,922
It is personal for me.

1210
01:43:18,626 --> 01:43:21,493
I came here only to
avenge my father's death.

1211
01:43:21,595 --> 01:43:22,789
And today when I
have the opportunity..

1212
01:43:22,897 --> 01:43:24,228
..you want me to stay put.

1213
01:43:24,331 --> 01:43:25,798
No. Never.

1214
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:27,697
I am going to face that rascal.

1215
01:43:33,974 --> 01:43:35,236
Fine.

1216
01:43:37,912 --> 01:43:42,781
Insy vinsy Spider
crawled up the water spout.

1217
01:43:43,350 --> 01:43:48,014
Down came the rain drop
and washed the Spider out.

1218
01:43:48,622 --> 01:43:49,919
Washed.

1219
01:43:50,824 --> 01:43:52,621
No, no.

1220
01:44:00,467 --> 01:44:01,934
Dress me up, baby.

1221
01:45:01,895 --> 01:45:06,298
Excuse me, ma'am. Here's
a bottle of champagne.

1222
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,197
With an invitation card for you.

1223
01:45:19,313 --> 01:45:23,340
Are you sure we will
get the car we need?

1224
01:45:24,251 --> 01:45:25,650
Are you sure this is the place?

1225
01:45:25,719 --> 01:45:27,812
This is what my contact told me.

1226
01:45:27,888 --> 01:45:29,287
He said that the guy's a genius.

1227
01:45:29,356 --> 01:45:31,221
He can provide us
with every type of car.

1228
01:45:31,959 --> 01:45:33,551
Anybody there?

1229
01:45:33,627 --> 01:45:38,360
The horse, dog and monkey are here.

1230
01:45:44,338 --> 01:45:48,934
Don't worry, I will give
them a good makeover..

1231
01:45:49,243 --> 01:45:52,007
..and no one will be
able to recognize them.

1232
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:55,781
Don't worry, I was
talking about the cars.

1233
01:45:56,583 --> 01:45:58,414
I have seen you somewhere.

1234
01:45:58,519 --> 01:46:00,384
You must have seen me in Amsterdam.

1235
01:46:00,487 --> 01:46:01,545
But that wasn't me.

1236
01:46:01,655 --> 01:46:03,623
My brother Budh Chopra, B.C.

1237
01:46:03,724 --> 01:46:06,488
I am M.C. Mangal Chopra.

1238
01:46:06,593 --> 01:46:08,891
I was born on a
Tuesday night at 11:55.

1239
01:46:08,962 --> 01:46:10,896
And he was born after 12:00.

1240
01:46:10,964 --> 01:46:12,454
So he became 'Budh' (Wednesday).

1241
01:46:12,566 --> 01:46:15,467
Two bodies and one soul.

1242
01:46:15,969 --> 01:46:18,665
I won't spare him.
- Who? Your brother?

1243
01:46:18,772 --> 01:46:21,935
No, the one who robbed
my brother's jewelry shop.

1244
01:46:22,209 --> 01:46:23,471
Completely ruined him.

1245
01:46:23,544 --> 01:46:25,603
I won't spare him.

1246
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:26,805
I won't spare him.

1247
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:28,541
Mangal, he isn't the one.

1248
01:46:30,417 --> 01:46:31,816
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1249
01:46:31,885 --> 01:46:33,648
We're twins after all.

1250
01:46:33,721 --> 01:46:35,848
So there's this strong
feeling that exists between us.

1251
01:46:35,956 --> 01:46:39,357
Like, 'Ram Aur Shyam',
'Sita Aur Gita', 'Karan Arjun'.

1252
01:46:39,460 --> 01:46:41,724
'Karan Arjun' weren't twins, father.

1253
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:44,925
It was a case of reincarnation.

1254
01:46:44,965 --> 01:46:48,264
Father had said that..

1255
01:46:48,535 --> 01:46:51,504
..we should interrupt
when elders are speaking.

1256
01:46:51,739 --> 01:46:53,832
Are they your children?

1257
01:46:54,608 --> 01:46:56,303
So I was told.

1258
01:46:56,610 --> 01:46:59,704
But they are..
- Do you have a doubt?

1259
01:47:00,013 --> 01:47:01,776
No..
- No, you should.

1260
01:47:01,849 --> 01:47:03,214
I do it everyday.

1261
01:47:03,283 --> 01:47:04,807
They are like their mother.

1262
01:47:05,519 --> 01:47:08,454
He's Suryaprakash, and
he's Chandraprakash.

1263
01:47:11,525 --> 01:47:14,255
She's my wife, Shanti.

1264
01:47:14,361 --> 01:47:17,819
Anil Kapoor's step sister. Shakaal.

1265
01:47:19,566 --> 01:47:20,794
Hello.

1266
01:47:21,502 --> 01:47:22,799
Shanti, we have guests.

1267
01:47:22,903 --> 01:47:25,736
Show some hospitality.
- Right away.

1268
01:47:25,839 --> 01:47:27,773
Tea and onion fritters.

1269
01:47:28,709 --> 01:47:31,803
Brother, you do take
ginger in your tea, don't you?

1270
01:47:31,879 --> 01:47:33,744
Yes.

1271
01:47:33,814 --> 01:47:36,647
Okay. Come, sons.
- Mother.

1272
01:47:36,717 --> 01:47:37,911
We will visit the temple today.

1273
01:47:38,218 --> 01:47:39,708
How Indian.

1274
01:47:39,987 --> 01:47:42,387
I modified them as well.

1275
01:47:42,489 --> 01:47:44,787
Because cars look in am imported look.

1276
01:47:44,892 --> 01:47:46,951
And foreigners always look good..

1277
01:47:47,227 --> 01:47:48,558
..with Indian values.

1278
01:47:48,762 --> 01:47:52,220
Sir, juice.
- Thank you.

1279
01:47:52,633 --> 01:47:54,430
He is our Ramu.

1280
01:47:55,302 --> 01:47:57,236
Hello.
- Hello.

1281
01:47:57,337 --> 01:48:00,773
He must be the first Indian
who has enslaved a British.

1282
01:48:00,841 --> 01:48:02,206
Did you say anything, son?
- No.

1283
01:48:02,276 --> 01:48:04,870
Greetings, uncle.
- Bless you, son.

1284
01:48:05,813 --> 01:48:06,939
So, what car..

1285
01:48:07,247 --> 01:48:08,646
Hello. Uncle's gone.

1286
01:48:08,749 --> 01:48:09,773
Tell me which car do you want?

1287
01:48:09,850 --> 01:48:11,818
Cheetah, Swamp deer, dog.

1288
01:48:11,885 --> 01:48:14,718
What do you call that? I want that.
- Rhino.

1289
01:48:15,355 --> 01:48:17,823
Get something to eat, I will ready it.

1290
01:48:17,891 --> 01:48:20,860
Uncle, call aunt.

1291
01:48:33,674 --> 01:48:35,369
Naina's a smart girl.

1292
01:48:35,943 --> 01:48:37,274
She will handle it.

1293
01:48:44,551 --> 01:48:46,382
We've started receiving
signal from the device.

1294
01:48:52,860 --> 01:48:55,328
The camera's working as well.

1295
01:49:18,185 --> 01:49:20,585
Look at his car collection.

1296
01:49:20,854 --> 01:49:23,288
Bilal, didn't you
want to buy this car?

1297
01:49:37,204 --> 01:49:38,535
Show me, baby.

1298
01:49:44,344 --> 01:49:45,606
Let her in, baby.

1299
01:49:48,615 --> 01:49:50,344
Voice automated villa.

1300
01:49:52,252 --> 01:49:53,480
Ronnie's dream.

1301
01:49:54,254 --> 01:49:58,452
The rascal didn't just steal
our gold but also our dreams.

1302
01:49:59,293 --> 01:50:00,419
Next.

1303
01:50:16,176 --> 01:50:17,336
Next.

1304
01:50:20,647 --> 01:50:21,875
Cool it, baby.

1305
01:50:30,824 --> 01:50:32,621
Open the web, baby.

1306
01:50:59,453 --> 01:51:02,684
He's really shining
after stealing our gold.

1307
01:51:03,223 --> 01:51:04,622
Don't worry, Sunny.

1308
01:51:05,559 --> 01:51:08,187
We'll peel of that shine.

1309
01:51:08,462 --> 01:51:09,895
Nice place.

1310
01:51:10,197 --> 01:51:11,824
You are one rich dude.

1311
01:51:13,934 --> 01:51:19,497
There were some fools who
couldn't handle their wealth.

1312
01:51:19,706 --> 01:51:21,571
All thanks to them.

1313
01:51:21,641 --> 01:51:27,477
By the way, what is a
beautiful Indian like you doing here?

1314
01:51:27,814 --> 01:51:30,612
I can ask you the same question.

1315
01:51:31,651 --> 01:51:32,948
Well, I am here on business.

1316
01:51:33,220 --> 01:51:34,881
I am here to have some fun.

1317
01:51:36,857 --> 01:51:38,347
I like it.

1318
01:51:38,959 --> 01:51:40,324
Come in.

1319
01:52:30,777 --> 01:52:36,682
''Why is distance between us?''

1320
01:52:37,717 --> 01:52:44,316
''Let's come closer.''

1321
01:52:44,691 --> 01:52:50,755
''Feel it in every breath.''

1322
01:52:51,598 --> 01:52:58,333
''My intoxication.''

1323
01:52:59,439 --> 01:53:02,670
''My charm always works.''

1324
01:53:02,742 --> 01:53:06,234
''My beauty is alluring.''

1325
01:53:06,313 --> 01:53:14,413
''My Beauty will make you sway.''

1326
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:39,975
''The passion that's burning in me.''

1327
01:53:41,548 --> 01:53:47,680
''You will experience it too.''

1328
01:53:47,787 --> 01:53:51,018
''You will soon know why lovers..

1329
01:53:51,324 --> 01:54:00,926
..intentionally lay down
their lives for their love.''

1330
01:54:01,568 --> 01:54:04,833
''I am life and death.''

1331
01:54:04,905 --> 01:54:08,397
''I am your beginning and end.''

1332
01:54:08,475 --> 01:54:16,644
''Come in my refuge and sway.''

1333
01:54:46,479 --> 01:54:49,915
''I am lonely and so are you.''

1334
01:54:50,016 --> 01:54:52,814
''It's a beautiful opportunity.''

1335
01:54:53,954 --> 01:55:00,382
''Let's get to know each other.''

1336
01:55:00,493 --> 01:55:06,625
''I don't know how and when
I lost my heart to you.''

1337
01:55:07,801 --> 01:55:13,762
''I never realized it.''

1338
01:55:14,207 --> 01:55:17,574
''My innocent heart fell for you.''

1339
01:55:17,677 --> 01:55:20,942
''The real culprit got acquitted.''

1340
01:55:21,248 --> 01:55:29,451
''Just take my life
and keep on swaying.''

1341
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:46,238
The gold is surely behind those doors.

1342
01:55:47,707 --> 01:55:50,676
First the bed, baby. Then the Jacuzzi.

1343
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:54,777
Close it, baby.

1344
01:55:57,317 --> 01:55:58,477
Come on, Naina.

1345
01:56:02,889 --> 01:56:04,720
Come on, Naina.

1346
01:56:11,698 --> 01:56:12,790
Found it.

1347
01:56:12,866 --> 01:56:14,857
The underground vault is
below the rascal's Jacuzzi.

1348
01:56:23,610 --> 01:56:25,510
Send Naina the signal to come out.

1349
01:56:35,622 --> 01:56:36,953
Hello, everybody.

1350
01:56:37,957 --> 01:56:39,549
Oh, Charlie.

1351
01:56:40,226 --> 01:56:44,253
Just like you sent Riya
to General Yueberhoff..

1352
01:56:45,265 --> 01:56:48,723
..similarly you sent her to me.

1353
01:56:52,272 --> 01:56:53,466
Everybody out.

1354
01:56:53,973 --> 01:56:55,372
I said out.

1355
01:57:41,554 --> 01:57:45,490
Welcome to my web,
says spider to the fly.

1356
01:57:46,526 --> 01:57:48,892
When I found out that you are alive..

1357
01:57:48,995 --> 01:57:52,692
..and here in Wellington,
I was really happy.

1358
01:57:53,366 --> 01:57:56,301
Spider, my car was
followed from home this morning.

1359
01:57:56,369 --> 01:57:57,495
No you dumb woman.

1360
01:57:57,570 --> 01:57:59,265
You're being followed from Auckland.

1361
01:58:03,543 --> 01:58:05,909
The dealer who told you about me..

1362
01:58:06,212 --> 01:58:09,238
..also told me about you.

1363
01:58:09,682 --> 01:58:11,513
And now that you are here..

1364
01:58:11,584 --> 01:58:14,314
..I felt that I will face
action once again in life.

1365
01:58:14,421 --> 01:58:15,683
But, Charlie.

1366
01:58:15,789 --> 01:58:18,485
The same old tricks,
the same thinking.

1367
01:58:18,591 --> 01:58:20,889
And because of your foolishness..

1368
01:58:21,194 --> 01:58:24,960
..first that idiot Ronnie
and then that old Victor..

1369
01:58:28,635 --> 01:58:31,536
Next time you take my
papa's name, do it with respect.

1370
01:58:34,207 --> 01:58:35,265
What are you staring at?

1371
01:58:35,341 --> 01:58:37,605
You should be thankful
that it was my left hand.

1372
01:58:41,381 --> 01:58:42,939
Open the door, baby.

1373
01:58:48,421 --> 01:58:50,821
Oh. Charlie has got a gun now.

1374
01:58:50,924 --> 01:58:53,552
What will he do? Shoot me.
Come on, shoot me.

1375
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:57,457
You will surely, but not so easily.

1376
01:58:58,965 --> 01:59:03,664
First, I will steal the
thing that's most dear to you.

1377
01:59:05,538 --> 01:59:09,201
Your gold, to the last gram.

1378
01:59:10,410 --> 01:59:13,811
Gone. In the next 48 hours.

1379
01:59:14,380 --> 01:59:15,813
An open challenge?

1380
01:59:16,583 --> 01:59:17,845
Man to man.

1381
01:59:18,418 --> 01:59:19,680
Player to player.

1382
01:59:20,353 --> 01:59:22,787
But don't you think
48 hours is too less.

1383
01:59:22,889 --> 01:59:25,619
I mean what can you
possibly do in two days..

1384
01:59:25,692 --> 01:59:30,527
When I can bypass your world
class security in two minutes..

1385
01:59:31,865 --> 01:59:34,595
..imagine what I can do in two days.

1386
01:59:35,235 --> 01:59:37,829
For the first time you
impressed me, Charlie, I like it.

1387
01:59:41,541 --> 01:59:42,838
48 hours.

1388
01:59:43,376 --> 01:59:44,934
And your time starts now.

1389
01:59:45,778 --> 01:59:46,938
Tick-tock.

1390
01:59:47,213 --> 01:59:48,339
Tick-tock.

1391
01:59:48,848 --> 01:59:50,679
You keep a watch on the clock.

1392
01:59:50,950 --> 01:59:52,542
And I will keep my eye on the gold.

1393
01:59:57,390 --> 01:59:59,221
Bilal, I think my watch is fast.

1394
01:59:59,292 --> 02:00:01,419
How many hours left to 48 hours?

1395
02:00:01,861 --> 02:00:04,261
This is the 12th time you
are asking in the last 6 hours.

1396
02:00:04,364 --> 02:00:06,389
Sorry, but I am slightly tense.

1397
02:00:06,499 --> 02:00:08,763
He proudly said 48 hours to him..

1398
02:00:08,835 --> 02:00:10,200
..but I hope we don't
make a fool of ourselves.

1399
02:00:10,303 --> 02:00:13,397
And if he wanted to say,
he could have said 72.

1400
02:00:13,506 --> 02:00:14,700
He could have said 96.

1401
02:00:14,774 --> 02:00:16,799
But no, he had to say 48..

1402
02:00:18,578 --> 02:00:20,307
I was explaining to him..

1403
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:24,646
..if Charlie has said 48 then he
must have thought of something.

1404
02:00:25,385 --> 02:00:26,511
Sunny.

1405
02:00:29,255 --> 02:00:30,620
I thought about it before speaking.

1406
02:00:31,224 --> 02:00:32,589
It will take Debrovsky that long..

1407
02:00:32,692 --> 02:00:34,250
..to come here from Moscow.

1408
02:00:37,530 --> 02:00:39,225
Bilal, call Debrovsky.

1409
02:00:39,465 --> 02:00:41,831
Tell him that the gold
he's been looking for..

1410
02:00:41,868 --> 02:00:45,770
..for the past one year
is here in Wellington.

1411
02:00:46,239 --> 02:00:47,672
And if he wants it..

1412
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:50,265
..then he should
come here in 48 hours.

1413
02:00:51,411 --> 02:00:53,402
What are you saying, Charlie?

1414
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:54,808
If the Russian Mafia arrive..

1415
02:00:54,914 --> 02:00:56,905
..then they will take all the gold.

1416
02:00:57,517 --> 02:01:00,247
Our first motive to
come here was revenge..

1417
02:01:00,653 --> 02:01:02,280
..and not to steal the gold.

1418
02:01:03,323 --> 02:01:04,585
Charlie is right.

1419
02:01:04,691 --> 02:01:05,919
It's not about the gold.

1420
02:01:06,192 --> 02:01:07,887
We should call Debrovsky.

1421
02:01:08,194 --> 02:01:09,889
This time you stay out of it, Naina.

1422
02:01:10,597 --> 02:01:12,724
We stole the gold amidst
the military commandoes..

1423
02:01:12,799 --> 02:01:14,391
..and not you.

1424
02:01:14,901 --> 02:01:16,892
Charlie, shall we
accept defeat so easily.

1425
02:01:17,570 --> 02:01:19,902
Some things are bigger
than winning and losing, Riya.

1426
02:01:21,908 --> 02:01:23,500
Call Debrovsky.

1427
02:02:08,788 --> 02:02:11,484
Someday you will surely kill me.

1428
02:02:11,557 --> 02:02:12,785
Don't worry, baby.

1429
02:02:12,859 --> 02:02:15,487
This gun's still
loaded with rubber bullets.

1430
02:02:23,736 --> 02:02:26,000
You must have heard
everything through this microphone.

1431
02:02:26,606 --> 02:02:28,733
Charlie Mascarenhas.

1432
02:02:29,409 --> 02:02:30,501
What a loser.

1433
02:02:30,576 --> 02:02:32,567
He informed the Russian Mafia.

1434
02:02:32,679 --> 02:02:36,877
Sorry, baby. I couldn't hold
them for long. - It's okay.

1435
02:02:37,417 --> 02:02:39,681
Neither him nor the Russian Mafia..

1436
02:02:39,786 --> 02:02:41,549
..can reach my gold.

1437
02:02:43,589 --> 02:02:46,956
Our gold, not yours.

1438
02:02:49,262 --> 02:02:50,820
Now that's what I like about you.

1439
02:02:51,664 --> 02:02:53,029
Your attitude.

1440
02:02:53,566 --> 02:02:55,500
But, what now?

1441
02:02:55,568 --> 02:02:58,799
I already have.

1442
02:02:59,472 --> 02:03:01,303
Now that's what I like about you.

1443
02:03:01,607 --> 02:03:02,904
You're fast.

1444
02:03:06,813 --> 02:03:09,577
Bad news.
- What now?

1445
02:03:09,649 --> 02:03:11,344
I have just received
news from my contact that..

1446
02:03:11,417 --> 02:03:13,476
..Spider has hired an armor
truck from Ace Securities.

1447
02:03:13,553 --> 02:03:17,284
That means he's shifting
his gold before 48 hours.

1448
02:03:17,657 --> 02:03:18,954
Don't panic, Sunny.

1449
02:03:21,260 --> 02:03:22,557
That's good news.

1450
02:03:23,896 --> 02:03:27,525
Now we will rob the gold
from the streets of Wellington.

1451
02:03:29,268 --> 02:03:31,429
Just like we did in India.

1452
02:03:32,638 --> 02:03:34,299
In broad daylight.

1453
02:03:35,575 --> 02:03:36,735
Wow.

1454
02:03:38,611 --> 02:03:40,306
What an idea, Charlie?

1455
02:03:40,580 --> 02:03:42,639
You thought of this so quickly.

1456
02:03:43,015 --> 02:03:44,642
Now that's what I like about you.

1457
02:03:44,717 --> 02:03:45,911
You are fast.

1458
02:03:49,288 --> 02:03:51,483
You are the fastest, baby.

1459
02:03:52,358 --> 02:03:53,552
What a bitch.

1460
02:03:53,926 --> 02:03:55,826
Now explain the plan in detail.

1461
02:03:57,630 --> 02:03:58,858
Plan no.1.

1462
02:03:59,799 --> 02:04:02,962
Sunny, get all the maps of this city.

1463
02:04:03,536 --> 02:04:04,901
Maps for the roads.

1464
02:04:05,338 --> 02:04:07,568
And maps for the
tunnels below the roads.

1465
02:04:36,369 --> 02:04:37,631
Bilal.

1466
02:04:51,417 --> 02:04:52,884
How could this be closed?

1467
02:04:55,321 --> 02:04:57,551
According to the map
there should be a road here.

1468
02:04:58,024 --> 02:04:59,457
Mark it.

1469
02:05:06,833 --> 02:05:08,425
Plan no.2.

1470
02:05:09,602 --> 02:05:12,730
Naina, tomorrow you will have to turn
Wellington to Mumbai for some hours.

1471
02:05:13,306 --> 02:05:15,797
Wellington's biggest traffic jam.

1472
02:05:16,609 --> 02:05:17,667
It will be done, Charlie.

1473
02:05:17,777 --> 02:05:20,678
And anyway, we Indians
love causing a traffic jam.

1474
02:05:30,923 --> 02:05:32,413
Plan no.3.

1475
02:05:33,860 --> 02:05:37,421
Riya, you begin our exit plan.

1476
02:05:38,464 --> 02:05:40,557
You will find a ship
with the help of Bilal..

1477
02:05:40,666 --> 02:05:43,226
..which we will use to
transport gold out of New Zealand.

1478
02:05:43,302 --> 02:05:45,532
Here's your money.
- Okay.

1479
02:05:46,839 --> 02:05:48,306
Thanks.
- Thanks.

1480
02:05:48,474 --> 02:05:49,600
That's your ship.

1481
02:05:53,512 --> 02:05:55,309
And the most important.

1482
02:05:55,781 --> 02:05:58,011
We will have to arrange for cars..

1483
02:05:58,517 --> 02:06:02,578
..that look small but
are the fastest on road.

1484
02:06:42,428 --> 02:06:43,486
Amazing.

1485
02:06:43,596 --> 02:06:44,858
Perfect timing, Charlie.

1486
02:06:47,266 --> 02:06:48,392
Even with all the weight..

1487
02:06:48,501 --> 02:06:49,798
..the cars didn't slowdown at all.

1488
02:06:49,902 --> 02:06:51,233
Did you see?

1489
02:06:51,304 --> 02:06:53,636
The marvel of my mice.

1490
02:06:53,706 --> 02:06:55,833
They can get in anything,
get out of anything..

1491
02:06:55,908 --> 02:06:58,001
..and carry any number of weight.

1492
02:06:58,277 --> 02:07:00,006
If you use them in a race..

1493
02:07:00,313 --> 02:07:02,338
..they will surely win the gold.

1494
02:07:02,448 --> 02:07:03,847
That is exactly what we want to do.

1495
02:07:06,419 --> 02:07:07,613
There was another thing.

1496
02:07:07,687 --> 02:07:08,915
Tell me.

1497
02:07:13,192 --> 02:07:14,625
Great.

1498
02:07:15,461 --> 02:07:16,621
You've been promoted.

1499
02:07:16,696 --> 02:07:19,324
I will get all the gold in this.

1500
02:07:19,632 --> 02:07:22,795
Do your legs reach down there?
- Yes.

1501
02:07:22,868 --> 02:07:24,802
Of course they do.

1502
02:07:36,749 --> 02:07:39,411
'Can I know who you are talking to? '

1503
02:07:50,663 --> 02:07:52,324
'She might have gone home.'

1504
02:07:55,334 --> 02:07:59,930
'My daughter cannot
pick up the phone.'

1505
02:08:01,307 --> 02:08:02,774
'There's a nurse
that stays with her.. '

1506
02:08:03,376 --> 02:08:05,503
'.. who calls me up
and lets her talk to me.'

1507
02:08:07,880 --> 02:08:09,905
'But if this is against your rules.. '

1508
02:08:10,716 --> 02:08:12,650
'.. then I will tell
her not to call me.'

1509
02:08:13,586 --> 02:08:17,750
'After all, I am doing this for her.'

1510
02:08:18,824 --> 02:08:20,519
'There is no such rule.. '

1511
02:08:21,927 --> 02:08:24,191
'.. that can stop a father
from talking to her daughter.'

1512
02:08:31,871 --> 02:08:33,270
Hey, Supergirl.

1513
02:08:33,372 --> 02:08:35,465
I don't want to talk to you.

1514
02:08:35,841 --> 02:08:37,604
Seems like Gudiya is angry with me.

1515
02:08:37,710 --> 02:08:38,768
Of course.

1516
02:08:38,878 --> 02:08:40,505
You have been fooling me
for the past one week.

1517
02:08:40,613 --> 02:08:42,308
''I will come soon, I will come soon.''

1518
02:08:42,415 --> 02:08:44,406
When will you come back to me?

1519
02:08:47,253 --> 02:08:48,311
Soon.

1520
02:08:48,387 --> 02:08:50,947
And the surprise that you
were supposed to bring along?

1521
02:08:53,225 --> 02:08:55,557
I stayed away from you
because of that surprise.

1522
02:08:56,462 --> 02:08:57,827
It's a big surprise.

1523
02:08:58,464 --> 02:09:02,161
That's why it took
really long to get it.

1524
02:09:02,334 --> 02:09:04,802
And you will teach me magic when
you come this time, won't you?

1525
02:09:04,870 --> 02:09:06,929
I have told all my friends..

1526
02:09:07,239 --> 02:09:09,400
..that I will become a
magician when I grow up.

1527
02:09:09,475 --> 02:09:10,703
Just like my papa.

1528
02:09:10,810 --> 02:09:13,608
There is no one else like my papa.

1529
02:09:13,712 --> 02:09:16,510
Yes or no?
- Yes, dear.

1530
02:09:19,318 --> 02:09:20,945
There is no one like your papa.

1531
02:09:27,927 --> 02:09:30,487
Bye, dear.
- Bye.

1532
02:09:43,742 --> 02:09:46,404
This one's for Ronnie and Victor.

1533
02:09:46,745 --> 02:09:48,212
Cheers.

1534
02:09:54,987 --> 02:09:56,614
May the best player win.

1535
02:10:33,392 --> 02:10:34,586
Hurry up, boys.

1536
02:10:39,798 --> 02:10:40,856
Sunny, come in.

1537
02:10:40,966 --> 02:10:42,900
Sunny, here. Go ahead.

1538
02:10:42,968 --> 02:10:45,528
Are you in position?
- Yes, of course.

1539
02:10:45,638 --> 02:10:47,538
I am waiting for the gold.

1540
02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:02,550
Charlie, you were right.

1541
02:11:02,621 --> 02:11:03,883
Game on, guys.

1542
02:11:04,657 --> 02:11:06,249
Naina, follow the truck.

1543
02:11:06,325 --> 02:11:07,587
Okay.

1544
02:11:38,224 --> 02:11:39,555
Welcome to Mumbai.

1545
02:11:47,833 --> 02:11:49,232
Oh no.

1546
02:11:55,674 --> 02:11:57,232
What the hell is going on?

1547
02:12:05,751 --> 02:12:06,979
Check the system.

1548
02:12:07,253 --> 02:12:08,743
Check quickly.

1549
02:12:18,297 --> 02:12:19,787
God damn it, you..

1550
02:12:19,898 --> 02:12:21,422
You wanted to right, didn't you?

1551
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:23,263
Now you will go left.

1552
02:12:32,244 --> 02:12:34,542
Sunny, my job's done and yours begins.

1553
02:12:34,613 --> 02:12:35,739
Okay.

1554
02:12:37,850 --> 02:12:39,545
Come to me, my darling.

1555
02:12:39,652 --> 02:12:41,643
Come and give me the gold.

1556
02:12:51,430 --> 02:12:52,863
Move it, move it.

1557
02:13:11,684 --> 02:13:13,345
Ready for the race, guys.

1558
02:13:54,693 --> 02:13:56,752
At the count of three, sharp left.

1559
02:13:57,763 --> 02:13:58,991
Three.

1560
02:13:59,665 --> 02:14:00,723
Two.

1561
02:14:01,333 --> 02:14:02,493
One, go.

1562
02:14:14,446 --> 02:14:16,539
Oh no. Not again. God dam it.

1563
02:14:16,648 --> 02:14:18,479
Why are you getting angry?

1564
02:14:18,584 --> 02:14:20,779
Just a little bit more.

1565
02:14:31,764 --> 02:14:34,232
Bilal.
- I am ready.

1566
02:14:34,299 --> 02:14:36,790
Sunny, bring the truck on the mark.
- Okay.

1567
02:14:40,305 --> 02:14:43,672
Charlie, he's ready to
plunge in the tunnel.

1568
02:15:18,644 --> 02:15:19,838
Okay, bye.

1569
02:15:19,945 --> 02:15:21,378
See you later.

1570
02:15:35,828 --> 02:15:37,591
What a plan, Charlie.

1571
02:15:37,663 --> 02:15:40,860
I never realized
when you stole my gold.

1572
02:15:44,369 --> 02:15:47,702
Gift. Gift. Gift. Its here,
its here, its here.

1573
02:15:47,773 --> 02:15:49,400
What are you doing here?

1574
02:15:49,641 --> 02:15:50,699
Just do as we told you..

1575
02:15:50,809 --> 02:15:51,867
..and get to the place
where you were supposed to be.

1576
02:15:51,977 --> 02:15:53,911
Just let me see the gold once.

1577
02:15:53,979 --> 02:15:55,469
And then I will leave.

1578
02:15:55,581 --> 02:15:57,572
Sunny, the gold isn't in the truck.

1579
02:15:58,584 --> 02:15:59,642
The truck is empty.

1580
02:15:59,751 --> 02:16:00,843
Empty?

1581
02:16:00,953 --> 02:16:02,944
I checked the tire
pressure of the truck..

1582
02:16:03,255 --> 02:16:05,189
..while entering and
exiting the villa.

1583
02:16:05,290 --> 02:16:06,382
They were both the same.

1584
02:16:06,458 --> 02:16:08,187
They why did you heist this truck?

1585
02:16:08,293 --> 02:16:10,557
So that the bird hovering above you..

1586
02:16:10,629 --> 02:16:12,722
..thinks that we have
fallen for his trap.

1587
02:16:12,831 --> 02:16:14,765
And now he can
easily get the gold out.

1588
02:16:14,867 --> 02:16:16,926
That means he's shifting
the gold from somewhere else?

1589
02:16:17,236 --> 02:16:18,464
Let's go.

1590
02:16:28,647 --> 02:16:31,207
Pamela, get the gold.

1591
02:16:31,517 --> 02:16:34,509
And come straight to my airstrip.
- Sure, boss.

1592
02:16:44,763 --> 02:16:45,923
Yes, Pamela.

1593
02:16:46,231 --> 02:16:47,698
We're coming out.

1594
02:16:47,733 --> 02:16:49,928
Yes, we're ready at the exit point.

1595
02:16:56,708 --> 02:16:57,834
Move.

1596
02:17:04,416 --> 02:17:05,508
The truck's coming.

1597
02:17:06,184 --> 02:17:07,481
Get ready.

1598
02:17:09,555 --> 02:17:11,352
Three, two, one.

1599
02:17:56,268 --> 02:17:57,895
Get ready to die.

1600
02:18:10,949 --> 02:18:12,678
That was my right.

1601
02:18:30,335 --> 02:18:31,495
Hello.

1602
02:18:33,372 --> 02:18:34,566
Hello.

1603
02:18:35,974 --> 02:18:37,441
Speak up you bitch.

1604
02:18:37,776 --> 02:18:39,437
Your bitch is gone.

1605
02:18:43,415 --> 02:18:44,882
You're next.

1606
02:18:45,817 --> 02:18:47,910
Who?
- Your father.

1607
02:18:52,257 --> 02:18:53,884
I am taking your gold.

1608
02:18:54,660 --> 02:18:56,525
Do whatever you like.

1609
02:19:00,866 --> 02:19:02,333
Charlie.

1610
02:19:03,935 --> 02:19:05,197
Yes, boss.

1611
02:19:05,303 --> 02:19:07,203
Sam you fool, the
gold has been stolen.

1612
02:19:07,372 --> 02:19:09,431
Go inside and kill them.
- Okay, boss.

1613
02:19:09,641 --> 02:19:10,835
Come on, guys.

1614
02:20:09,367 --> 02:20:12,700
Come on, come on, all the best.

1615
02:20:12,771 --> 02:20:15,296
Come on, throw it, throw it.

1616
02:20:23,782 --> 02:20:25,511
Great, they fell down.

1617
02:22:15,827 --> 02:22:17,886
Hello.
- Charlie, where are you?

1618
02:22:17,996 --> 02:22:19,623
We are reaching Marina Bay.

1619
02:22:19,764 --> 02:22:21,698
Is everything ready?
- Absolutely.

1620
02:22:21,766 --> 02:22:23,427
I am waiting for you.

1621
02:22:24,302 --> 02:22:25,394
Marina Bay.

1622
02:22:29,741 --> 02:22:32,369
Careful, guys, don't hurt them.

1623
02:24:29,995 --> 02:24:31,895
Surprise. Surprise.

1624
02:24:32,564 --> 02:24:35,897
It's become a habit for me
to bring twist in the story.

1625
02:24:36,001 --> 02:24:41,268
Just like it's become your habit
to become predictable, Charlie.

1626
02:24:42,574 --> 02:24:44,565
There's another surprise for you.

1627
02:24:44,909 --> 02:24:47,639
Your old friend.

1628
02:24:56,755 --> 02:25:00,782
You thought you met her
again in the Mini Market.

1629
02:25:01,960 --> 02:25:03,860
But forgive me, friends.

1630
02:25:04,529 --> 02:25:09,193
She was actually keeping
a watch on all of you.

1631
02:25:12,837 --> 02:25:14,395
Why did you do this?

1632
02:25:14,606 --> 02:25:16,506
I didn't have a choice, Charlie.

1633
02:25:17,242 --> 02:25:18,504
What could I do?

1634
02:25:19,344 --> 02:25:23,474
A helpless girl who had
to face the world alone..

1635
02:25:23,915 --> 02:25:27,248
..she had to fulfill her
dreams and of her old parents.

1636
02:25:30,522 --> 02:25:32,649
Isn't that the kind of
story you want to hear?

1637
02:25:33,224 --> 02:25:37,718
Crap. The truth is I always
wanted to be with the winner.

1638
02:25:38,229 --> 02:25:41,460
And that night in
Moscow's club I found my winner.

1639
02:25:45,804 --> 02:25:46,896
'Nervous.'

1640
02:25:47,005 --> 02:25:47,903
'No.'

1641
02:25:47,972 --> 02:25:50,372
'But this waiting is.'

1642
02:25:54,612 --> 02:25:55,874
'I need a drink.'

1643
02:25:59,951 --> 02:26:01,578
'Sorry.
- It's okay. '

1644
02:26:04,756 --> 02:26:06,656
'One apple martini please. .'

1645
02:26:06,758 --> 02:26:08,316
'Spider, give me a cigarette.'

1646
02:26:08,426 --> 02:26:09,757
'I don't smoke.'

1647
02:26:12,597 --> 02:26:14,428
'Then whose packet is this? '

1648
02:26:18,770 --> 02:26:20,203
'And what is this? '

1649
02:26:25,343 --> 02:26:27,903
'Our exit plan after the robbery.'

1650
02:26:29,914 --> 02:26:31,677
'Smart, Spider.'

1651
02:26:33,585 --> 02:26:36,577
'What if I don't
tell this to anyone? '

1652
02:26:38,923 --> 02:26:40,652
Actually speaking I
did have a choice..

1653
02:26:40,758 --> 02:26:42,851
..and I could have told
you about Spider's plan.

1654
02:26:43,328 --> 02:26:45,888
But the mission was
impossible without Spider.

1655
02:26:46,464 --> 02:26:48,261
And what would I get in return?

1656
02:26:48,633 --> 02:26:51,397
Z E R O.

1657
02:26:51,503 --> 02:26:52,663
That means just for the money you..

1658
02:26:52,770 --> 02:26:54,670
Shut up. Stop this charade.

1659
02:26:54,772 --> 02:26:55,864
Tell me where is it?

1660
02:26:55,974 --> 02:26:58,670
It's a big place, it can be anywhere.

1661
02:27:01,813 --> 02:27:03,246
Where is my gold?

1662
02:27:25,503 --> 02:27:26,697
Where is the gold?

1663
02:27:31,209 --> 02:27:32,836
What the.. Where is the gold?

1664
02:27:33,978 --> 02:27:35,775
Surprise. Surprise.

1665
02:27:38,583 --> 02:27:41,211
If the gold isn't in the
car then where is it, Spider?

1666
02:27:45,523 --> 02:27:46,854
Sorry, Riya.

1667
02:27:47,825 --> 02:27:49,793
I didn't have a choice either.

1668
02:27:51,362 --> 02:27:53,728
You were sitting on 500 million.

1669
02:27:54,432 --> 02:27:58,368
So why did you have to steal the
painting from the Wellington Museum?

1670
02:27:58,803 --> 02:28:00,327
'She is leaving.'

1671
02:28:03,208 --> 02:28:04,607
You could've retired.

1672
02:28:05,510 --> 02:28:10,345
But then, only
policemen retire, not thieves.

1673
02:28:10,582 --> 02:28:14,313
He knew. He knew everything
about you, you dumb woman.

1674
02:28:16,521 --> 02:28:18,648
Why are you scolding
this dumb woman, Spider?

1675
02:28:19,190 --> 02:28:21,249
She was helpless before her habit.

1676
02:28:21,459 --> 02:28:23,222
You are the real fool.

1677
02:28:23,695 --> 02:28:26,664
Who asked you to put up
that same stolen painting..

1678
02:28:26,764 --> 02:28:29,198
..in your villa?

1679
02:28:29,634 --> 02:28:31,534
Open the door, baby.

1680
02:28:34,505 --> 02:28:38,464
500 million, and what
does he put up in his villa?

1681
02:28:38,977 --> 02:28:40,706
A stolen painting?

1682
02:28:42,580 --> 02:28:44,707
There's a limit to being cheap.

1683
02:28:46,918 --> 02:28:48,818
Speechless after hearing all this.

1684
02:28:49,921 --> 02:28:51,718
But I hope your watch is working.

1685
02:28:52,257 --> 02:28:53,315
Tick-tock.

1686
02:28:53,391 --> 02:28:54,483
Tick-tock.

1687
02:28:55,260 --> 02:28:59,526
There's still one
hour left to 48 hours.

1688
02:29:01,666 --> 02:29:04,260
Do you know what your
biggest problem is, Spider?

1689
02:29:05,637 --> 02:29:07,502
You're always ahead.

1690
02:29:08,840 --> 02:29:10,398
And the one who walks ahead..

1691
02:29:10,508 --> 02:29:14,376
..never realize when the
entire game has changed behind them.

1692
02:29:16,681 --> 02:29:19,172
And as far as the twist in
the story is concerned..

1693
02:29:20,551 --> 02:29:23,748
..how can you forget that the
last twist belongs to the hero..

1694
02:29:24,756 --> 02:29:26,656
..and not the villain.

1695
02:29:31,195 --> 02:29:36,326
Now even a fool like you
can understand this twist.

1696
02:29:39,704 --> 02:29:45,472
I gave you the information
that you wanted to hear.

1697
02:29:46,344 --> 02:29:47,902
'Call Debrovsky.'

1698
02:29:56,587 --> 02:29:59,681
I knew that Spider
would come out of his web..

1699
02:30:00,258 --> 02:30:02,556
..after hearing
about the Russian mafia.

1700
02:30:03,494 --> 02:30:04,756
And you did.

1701
02:30:05,263 --> 02:30:08,391
How predictable.

1702
02:30:08,533 --> 02:30:09,761
No, Charlie.

1703
02:30:10,268 --> 02:30:12,463
I will tell you who is predictable.

1704
02:30:12,870 --> 02:30:15,771
I can point a gun at
anyone here I want.

1705
02:30:16,674 --> 02:30:20,838
But I will point this gun
at..the bitch who betrayed you.

1706
02:30:25,516 --> 02:30:26,949
What are you doing, Spider?

1707
02:30:28,252 --> 02:30:29,310
Quiet.

1708
02:30:29,387 --> 02:30:31,378
Your expiry date is gone.

1709
02:30:31,556 --> 02:30:33,251
And anyway, you have
already given me..

1710
02:30:33,358 --> 02:30:35,292
..all the information you
had to in the last six months.

1711
02:30:35,393 --> 02:30:37,224
And as far as loyalty is concerned..

1712
02:30:37,328 --> 02:30:41,526
..so when you can betray
a nice guy like Charlie..

1713
02:30:41,899 --> 02:30:43,366
..then how can you be loyal to me?

1714
02:30:47,305 --> 02:30:50,502
Chill bitch, this time there
are real bullets in the gun.

1715
02:30:53,778 --> 02:30:55,405
Did I break your heart?

1716
02:30:58,483 --> 02:31:01,213
Charlie, do you know..

1717
02:31:01,252 --> 02:31:03,550
..why she asked me to put up
that charade of fake bullets?

1718
02:31:03,654 --> 02:31:06,214
Because she didn't want to
break your heart, Charlie.

1719
02:31:06,591 --> 02:31:08,752
She didn't want you to
know that she betrayed you..

1720
02:31:08,860 --> 02:31:10,657
..before you died.

1721
02:31:11,195 --> 02:31:15,359
You can kill someone
but not break his heart.

1722
02:31:16,868 --> 02:31:18,392
Women, I tell you.

1723
02:31:20,238 --> 02:31:22,331
So my predictable good man.

1724
02:31:22,807 --> 02:31:24,707
Tell me where my gold is.

1725
02:31:28,312 --> 02:31:30,337
So he's the winner you chose?

1726
02:31:35,853 --> 02:31:37,684
Come on, Charlie. Tell me.

1727
02:31:38,756 --> 02:31:40,348
Tell me, Charlie.

1728
02:31:40,925 --> 02:31:42,483
I don't have all the time.

1729
02:31:44,929 --> 02:31:47,523
Tell me, Charlie, or
else I will shoot her.

1730
02:31:48,299 --> 02:31:50,665
You are wasting my time now, Charlie,
I will shoot her.

1731
02:31:50,768 --> 02:31:52,235
Wait.

1732
02:31:53,404 --> 02:31:54,598
I will tell you.

1733
02:32:09,587 --> 02:32:10,815
Riya.

1734
02:32:18,863 --> 02:32:20,421
Sorry, Charlie.

1735
02:32:21,632 --> 02:32:23,827
I didn't have a choice then.

1736
02:32:25,570 --> 02:32:26,867
But I do now.

1737
02:32:32,844 --> 02:32:33,970
Riya.

1738
02:32:43,688 --> 02:32:44,916
Bilal.

1739
02:34:06,971 --> 02:34:08,461
Hit him.

1740
02:34:08,539 --> 02:34:10,734
We still don't know where the gold is.

1741
02:34:37,602 --> 02:34:42,232
All my life I will regret
that I couldn't kill you.

1742
02:35:11,302 --> 02:35:16,535
Down came the rain drop
and washed the Spider out.

1743
02:36:14,365 --> 02:36:16,629
Chief, there's a call for you.

1744
02:36:16,901 --> 02:36:18,334
Okay.

1745
02:36:19,570 --> 02:36:20,798
Hello.

1746
02:36:23,974 --> 02:36:25,441
Romanian gold?

1747
02:36:26,510 --> 02:36:27,943
Where in Wellington?

1748
02:36:28,779 --> 02:36:32,875
Where? Where?

1749
02:36:34,251 --> 02:36:35,343
Let's go.

1750
02:36:42,827 --> 02:36:44,556
Which are these three cars?

1751
02:36:44,662 --> 02:36:46,755
Just a minute. Just a minute.

1752
02:36:46,831 --> 02:36:49,891
I will tell you the
test of these three cars.

1753
02:36:59,977 --> 02:37:01,842
So now I understand.

1754
02:37:01,946 --> 02:37:04,244
You left the gold filled cars here.

1755
02:37:04,348 --> 02:37:05,940
And took these empty cars.

1756
02:37:06,250 --> 02:37:07,740
Great, Charlie.

1757
02:37:07,852 --> 02:37:10,412
All thanks to M. C and his family.

1758
02:37:10,521 --> 02:37:12,386
You are Indians.

1759
02:37:12,456 --> 02:37:15,721
And I can even lay
down my life for Indians.

1760
02:37:16,327 --> 02:37:18,921
Go on, go on.

1761
02:37:19,663 --> 02:37:21,927
If they had waited a
little while longer..

1762
02:37:22,199 --> 02:37:23,962
..they could've taken
the veneration offerings.

1763
02:37:24,268 --> 02:37:27,431
My darling, they
have got their reward.

1764
02:37:27,538 --> 02:37:30,336
Now I will conduct the
veneration and give you your reward.

1765
02:37:30,441 --> 02:37:31,499
Come on.
- No, no.

1766
02:37:31,609 --> 02:37:33,372
Come on. Saying no to offerings.

1767
02:37:44,455 --> 02:37:45,717
Guys, Russian Mafia.

1768
02:37:46,257 --> 02:37:47,451
Everyone be cool.

1769
02:37:47,625 --> 02:37:49,490
No one will argue with them.

1770
02:37:53,864 --> 02:37:55,422
Check their cars.

1771
02:37:56,834 --> 02:37:59,325
But, sir, please..
- Shut up.

1772
02:37:59,436 --> 02:38:00,698
Understand.

1773
02:38:05,409 --> 02:38:06,501
Empty.

1774
02:38:06,677 --> 02:38:07,769
No gold.

1775
02:38:12,950 --> 02:38:14,212
No gold.

1776
02:38:14,318 --> 02:38:15,615
It's not in this car either.

1777
02:38:15,719 --> 02:38:16,913
Then where is the gold?

1778
02:38:17,221 --> 02:38:18,313
Be quiet.

1779
02:38:29,834 --> 02:38:31,961
You look angry.

1780
02:38:32,269 --> 02:38:34,737
Look, don't lock horns with me today.

1781
02:38:34,839 --> 02:38:37,501
I have suffered a loss of 100 million.

1782
02:38:37,608 --> 02:38:39,701
I put my life at stake to get
the gold and what did I get?

1783
02:38:39,810 --> 02:38:40,936
Zilch.

1784
02:38:41,512 --> 02:38:43,412
What will I tell my
father when I return home?

1785
02:38:43,581 --> 02:38:44,809
You have the cars for your father.

1786
02:38:44,915 --> 02:38:46,906
What car?

1787
02:38:46,984 --> 02:38:48,417
Forget this.

1788
02:38:48,519 --> 02:38:51,420
Give him champagne.
- Yes, give me some poison.

1789
02:38:51,522 --> 02:38:53,717
Drink champagne and not poison.

1790
02:38:55,826 --> 02:38:57,851
At least spare this car.

1791
02:38:57,962 --> 02:38:59,725
That's the only memorabilia.

1792
02:39:10,841 --> 02:39:13,503
Oh my, it's made of gold.

1793
02:39:14,211 --> 02:39:15,303
And the rest of the cars?

1794
02:39:15,412 --> 02:39:16,436
What do you think?

1795
02:39:16,814 --> 02:39:21,547
Do you make cars only of
steel or iron.. - Brass, copper..

1796
02:39:21,652 --> 02:39:25,179
..fiber, thermocol, anything you want.

1797
02:39:25,956 --> 02:39:27,821
Gold.
- I..

1798
02:39:28,325 --> 02:39:30,589
Gold?
- Gold.

1799
02:39:32,463 --> 02:39:34,693
You mean the gold wasn't in the car..

1800
02:39:34,798 --> 02:39:36,561
..the car was made of gold itself.

1801
02:40:08,799 --> 02:40:11,666
Uncle, autograph please.

1802
02:40:13,704 --> 02:40:15,899
People will be stunned..

1803
02:40:16,206 --> 02:40:19,903
..when they see the
gold tires of my car.

1804
02:40:24,949 --> 02:40:27,281
Wow.
- Say it.

1805
02:40:27,785 --> 02:40:29,412
Open the gate, papa.

1806
02:41:20,838 --> 02:41:26,640
''Why is distance between us?''

1807
02:41:27,878 --> 02:41:34,181
''Let's come closer.''

1808
02:41:35,185 --> 02:41:41,351
''Feel it in every breath.''

1809
02:41:42,259 --> 02:41:49,324
''My intoxication.''

1810
02:41:50,267 --> 02:41:53,668
''Your charm always works.''

1811
02:41:53,771 --> 02:41:57,400
''Your beauty is alluring.''

1812
02:41:57,508 --> 02:42:00,807
''Your Beauty makes me sway.''

1813
02:42:00,911 --> 02:42:04,438
''I am enchanted by you.''

1814
02:42:04,548 --> 02:42:07,847
''Your intoxication is like a dream.''

1815
02:42:07,951 --> 02:42:11,443
''Your Beauty makes me sway.''

1816
02:42:11,555 --> 02:42:19,963
''You dwell in my thoughts,
my questions and my answers.''

1817
02:42:32,776 --> 02:42:39,272
''You are my desire.''

1818
02:42:40,584 --> 02:42:47,285
''You are my passion.''

1819
02:42:47,391 --> 02:42:53,762
''My life depends on you.''

1820
02:42:54,932 --> 02:43:00,962
''Always stay with me.''

1821
02:43:01,338 --> 02:43:04,774
''You have now become my habit.''

1822
02:43:04,842 --> 02:43:08,437
''Not just my habit, but I need you.''

Cigarette smoking is
injurious to health.

00:00:05,437 --> 00:00:07,849
Cigarette smoking is
injurious to health.

3
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:11,584
It causes CANCER.

4
00:00:14,847 --> 00:00:16,884
Cigarette smoking is
injurious to health.

5
00:00:19,318 --> 00:00:21,229
It causes CANCER.

6
00:02:56,508 --> 00:02:58,510
Please. Please.
- Get lost. Go on.

7
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:01,424
Constable.

8
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:04,290
Here's Rs. 100.
- What for?

9
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:05,823
I ran a red light yesterday.

10
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:08,330
A woman was pregnant.
I had to rush her to the hospital.

11
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:09,627
This is the fine for
breaking the signal.

12
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:10,666
Wow, Savitribai.

13
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:11,633
If everyone can be as honest as you..

14
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,794
âThere will be no need for us.

15
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:14,269
Okay, Jai Hind.

16
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:16,567
Hey. Where's the receipt?

17
00:03:17,496 --> 00:03:19,305
Oh! I completely forgot.

18
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,309
Here's your receipt.

19
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,868
How's your son? Where is he?

20
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:24,113
He is fine.
He's studying in school now.

21
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:25,847
When he grows up I'll
make him a police officer.

22
00:03:26,138 --> 00:03:27,310
I see, you mean like us.

23
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,743
I'll make him an
honest police officer.

24
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:31,114
Jai Hind.

25
00:03:31,643 --> 00:03:35,489
Children. This is India.

26
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:38,153
In the North are the Himalayas.

27
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:41,198
And in the South is the Indian Ocean.

28
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:43,325
Vishwas.

29
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:45,526
Vishwasl
- Yes, sir.

30
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,735
What's in the South of India?
- Rajnikant.

31
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:49,668
Quiet!

32
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:50,898
And what'sâ

33
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:52,800
What's that in your hands?
- Nothing.

34
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:54,868
Nothing.
- Show me.

35
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,578
So this is what you read in class?

36
00:03:57,636 --> 00:03:58,512
Film magazines!

37
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,277
Sir, this belongs to Gopi not me.

38
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:02,216
Gopi..
- No, sir. He asked me to get it.

39
00:04:02,274 --> 00:04:03,651
Sir, he didâ
- No, sir, it was him..

40
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:04,744
Quiet!

41
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,187
You don't have a father.

42
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:07,383
Your mother works hard all dayâ

43
00:04:07,446 --> 00:04:08,516
âto pay for your educationâ

44
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:09,725
...so that you can become
someone successful.

45
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:11,788
I want to be successful like someone,
sir. - Like whom?

46
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,830
Shahrukh Khan? Salman Khan?
Amir Khan?

47
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:15,459
No, sir. Why would
I be successful like them?

48
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,865
I am Rao. Vishwas Rao.

49
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,693
Hero Vishwas Rao.

50
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,764
What did you study in school today?

51
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:27,675
Don't ask about the study.
I'm tired of studying all day.

52
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,438
I see. Here.
I've brought dry-fruits for you.

53
00:04:31,703 --> 00:04:33,876
Mom. Let me drive for a while.

54
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:35,646
No. Not yet.

55
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,849
Only after you turn
18 and get a licenseâ

56
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,151
...you can drive then.

57
00:04:40,212 --> 00:04:42,317
Come on, mom.
Let me drive for a while.

58
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:44,793
No one's watching anyway.

59
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:47,788
Get down!

60
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,597
Don't ever say that again.

61
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:54,429
I'm watching, God's watching.

62
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,535
So never do anything wrong.

63
00:04:56,595 --> 00:04:57,573
Do you get that?
- Yes.

64
00:04:58,864 --> 00:04:59,842
No, you didn't.

65
00:05:00,265 --> 00:05:01,437
I'll explain to you.

66
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:06,444
Stand in front of all
the trees here and sayâ

67
00:05:06,905 --> 00:05:12,514
""I swear on you, my mother and God..""

68
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,683
""..that I will never
do anything wrong.""

69
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,749
Go on.

70
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,760
Go.

71
00:05:24,356 --> 00:05:25,334
Say it.

72
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:31,265
I swear on you, my mother and Godâ

73
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,867
âthat I will never do anything wrong.

74
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,581
""I'll become an honest
police officer.""

75
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,653
I'll become an honest police officer.

76
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,318
Bravo.

77
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:54,721
In future he'll be a police officer.

78
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:56,766
I want you to train him..

79
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,464
âSo that he can beat-up the bad guys.

80
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,333
Definitely, sister.
He will beat them all up.

81
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:03,202
I will train him so wellâ

82
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,242
âthat he'll beat
up 10 bad guys at a time.

83
00:06:05,797 --> 00:06:07,572
That's it, only 10?

84
00:06:09,735 --> 00:06:13,342
You're going to become a
police officer? - Yes, Gopi. I am.

85
00:06:13,405 --> 00:06:15,043
I will be a police officer.

86
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,612
I'll be a Don.

87
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:20,248
I'll be a judge. I'll be a doctor.

88
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:21,791
I'll be an engineer too.

89
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:23,690
But how can you be all that?

90
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:25,786
Because I'll be a movie-star.

91
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,728
Help!
- Wait.

92
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:14,167
Help!

93
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,659
Hey Vishu.

94
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,300
Who are you?

95
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:49,464
I just showed a little style,
a little attitudeâ

96
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:51,303
âand you're already scared.

97
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,503
The hero's just made his entry.

98
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,846
Wait and watch what happens next.

99
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:57,812
Thrash him.

100
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:00,816
Hey morons.

101
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:04,342
If you have the guts...then..

102
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:06,787
âDon't come one-by-one.

103
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:07,789
Come together.

104
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,058
I'm in a hurry.

105
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,053
Start!

106
00:10:21,753 --> 00:10:23,391
Catch them.

107
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:30,800
Through the poster, emerges the hero.

108
00:10:30,862 --> 00:10:32,500
Fantastic dialogues.

109
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:33,907
Terrific fighting.

110
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:37,503
Just like a hero.
- That's what I want to be, Gopi.

111
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:38,513
Just wait and watch.

112
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,880
Soon you'll see huge posters of me.

113
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:42,748
Did you hear, aunt?
- No, mom.

114
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:45,413
Hero?

115
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:46,353
Go on.

116
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:48,448
Your mother will definitely
make you a police officer.

117
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,487
Tomorrow is your entrance exam.

118
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:51,789
Go and prepare.

119
00:10:57,222 --> 00:10:58,599
<i>Vishwas Ram'</i>

120
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:01,731
May I come in, sir?
- Come in.

121
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:04,073
Thank you, sir.

122
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:07,341
Sir!

123
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:09,712
Are you unwell?
- No, sir.

00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:14,775
You see, sir...l get breathless soon.

125
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:17,477
But nothing to worry about, sir.

126
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,283
It's been like this since childhood.

127
00:11:19,744 --> 00:11:20,745
Sir!

128
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:23,349
Did you hurt your leg?
- No, sir.

129
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:26,225
You see...I've one short leg.

130
00:11:27,385 --> 00:11:28,864
But nothing to worry about, sir.

131
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,422
It's been like this since childhood.

132
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,299
And yet you want to join
the police force? - Yes, sir.

133
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,538
I want to join the police
force and serve the country.

134
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,472
That's been my childhood dream.

135
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,406
Sir!

136
00:11:39,464 --> 00:11:40,602
Fine.

137
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:43,145
Let's check your eyes.
- Yes, sir.

138
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:47,914
Read the first letter.

139
00:11:48,273 --> 00:11:49,581
Which letter sir?

140
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:52,581
First letter. It's up there.

141
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,716
Up where, sir?

142
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:57,690
Up on the chart.

143
00:11:57,749 --> 00:11:58,819
What chart, sir?

144
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,565
The chart that's on the stand.
- What stand, sir?

145
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,759
Impossible!

146
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:08,737
What was that?
- Nothing, sir.

147
00:12:08,793 --> 00:12:09,863
What was that?

148
00:12:10,161 --> 00:12:13,108
Sometimes I...check it like this.

149
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,769
Y-

150
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:17,836
The first letter is Y.

151
00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:19,513
Rejected.

152
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:22,677
Selected!
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.

153
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:23,617
Sir!

154
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:26,520
So you've a hearing problem as well.

155
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:27,318
Sometimes, sir.

156
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,188
But nothing to worry about, sir.

157
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:31,227
It's been like this since childhood.

158
00:12:31,516 --> 00:12:32,494
Get out!

159
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,389
Get out!

160
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:35,226
Get out!

161
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:36,288

Sir!

166
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:55,550
Take down my telephone number. Please.

167
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:00,186
If my country ever needs me..

168
00:13:00,478 --> 00:13:02,219
...I'm always at service.

169
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,585
You get exhausted even while talking.

170
00:13:06,217 --> 00:13:08,561
You can't walk few steps properly.

171
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,725
You can't see or hear properly.

172
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,531
What good are you to the country?

173
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,401
I think you're angry right now?

174
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:17,734
I'll come later and explain to you.

175
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:19,731
What time do I come, sir?

176
00:13:20,165 --> 00:13:21,303
Why you..

177
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:23,539
Get lost you cripple!

178
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:25,412
Get lost you deaf!

179
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,414
Get lost! Get lost!

180
00:13:34,913 --> 00:13:36,654
I still don't understandâ

181
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,218
...why you always fail
the police entrance test.

182
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:39,819
Forget it, mom.

183
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:41,761
These policemen are not too smart.

184
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,662
What?

185
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:45,896
See what's written here?
- What?

186
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:50,469
It says here ""Terrorists
attack a group of policemen"".

187
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:53,233
""12 policemen dead.""

188
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:56,769
""Three of them were new recruits.""

189
00:13:57,202 --> 00:13:58,909
They were just my age. Did you hear?

190
00:13:59,404 --> 00:14:00,678
What if I had died like this?

191
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,218
Then, what about you?

192
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:05,448
No, mom.
I don't want to make you upsetâ

193
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,580
...by joining the police.

194
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:09,349
I would've felt proud,
instead of being upset.

195
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:10,222
I see.

196
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:11,851
You didn't read this other news.

197
00:14:12,183 --> 00:14:13,218
It's written here..

198
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:17,055
""Dacoits shot a police
officer's mother dead.""

199
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:18,857
Did you hear?

200
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:20,527
They shot the mother.

201
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:22,868
No, mom.
I can't put your life in danger.

202
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,837
I will never join the police force,
that's it.

203
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:28,133
What did you say?

204
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:29,809
How dare you?
- Mom.

205
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:31,404
Listen to me, mom.
- Stop. Stop I say.

206
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:32,504
Listen to me..
- Stop.

207
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,176
I'll leach you a lessonâ
- I'm going.

208
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:39,119
I'll show you when you
come back in the evening.

209
00:14:54,726 --> 00:15:00,472
""All I want is you, forever, mom.""

210
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:06,141
""I want you to be my earth and sky,
forever, mom.""

211
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:16,820
""All I want is you, forever, mom.""

212
00:15:17,415 --> 00:15:22,592
""I want you to be my earth and sky,
forever, mom.""

213
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:27,797
""I know...that Lord
dwells in our heart.""

214
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:33,866
""But...my sweet-innocent
mom dwells in my heart.""

215
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:39,507
""But...my sweet-innocent
mom dwells in my heart.""

216
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:53,857
""The world's crazy.""

217
00:15:54,419 --> 00:16:02,429
""They go to temples and
shrines to cajole the Lord.""

218
00:16:02,827 --> 00:16:07,827
""My shrine's in my home,
whenever I look at mom.""

219
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:19,653
""Whenever I look at mom.""

220
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:27,230
""You're the only one
I pray for forever, mom.""

221
00:16:27,585 --> 00:16:32,534
""You're the only feeling
I want forever, mom.""

222
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:35,767
Stop. Stop. Stop.

223
00:16:36,594 --> 00:16:37,698
Congratulation.

224
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:40,174
This is the reply to the applicationâ

225
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:41,539
âthat we sent to
the police department.

226
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:44,272
Vishwas has been called
to Mumbai for an interview.

227
00:16:46,137 --> 00:16:46,774
Mumbai?

228
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:48,513
You just hit the jackpot, Vishu.

229
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:50,314
What jackpot, Gopi?

230
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:52,248
Mom's sending me for
the police selection.

231
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,288
I know she is.

232
00:16:53,344 --> 00:16:54,789
She always refused earlier.

233
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:56,223
Now you can go to Mumbai. Be a star.

234
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,624
""Yeah right. Go. Be a star.""

235
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,795
As if every director's
waiting for my arrival.

236
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:02,155
Didn't I tell you?

237
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,166
The girl you saved
at the cinema hall..

238
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:06,202
âHas a distant uncle. Yogi.

239
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:07,702
He's a renowned writer.

240
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:10,262
He knows every producer/director
in the industry.

241
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:12,330
He will get you a break in acting.

242
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:14,438
Really?
- Yes.

243
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:47,773
Traitor,
why did you go meet our enemyâ

244
00:17:47,832 --> 00:17:49,573
...Jt. Commissioner Khare?

245
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:51,375
And what did you tell him? Speak up.

246
00:17:52,503 --> 00:17:54,881
He was saying, something despicableâ

247
00:17:55,173 --> 00:17:57,244
âis about to happen in the city..

248
00:17:57,308 --> 00:17:59,652
...by the name of
'Mission White Elephant'.

249
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:02,780
What is that?

250
00:18:03,147 --> 00:18:04,558
Andâ
- And?

251
00:18:05,283 --> 00:18:11,199
He wanted to know when
Napoleon sir is arriving.

252
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:16,130
RDX.
- Yes, sir.

253
00:18:16,194 --> 00:18:18,697
Take him along,
and practise target on him.

254
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:20,106
Yes, sir.
- No, sir.

255
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:25,638
Jt. Commissioner Khareâ

256
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,251
âhas got a whiff of our mission.

257
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,047
And about Napoleon, sir.

258
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,222
Now there will be war.

259
00:18:44,522 --> 00:18:45,762
What do I do, Lord?

260
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:47,125
What do I do?

261
00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:50,404
After making me blind,
You've turned deaf.

262
00:18:51,262 --> 00:18:52,673
I haven't eaten for three days.

263
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:55,804
I don't even have
the money to buy poison.

264
00:18:57,568 --> 00:18:59,605
Now You've to help
me in taking my life.

265
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,548
No, mister. Don't lose hope so soon.

266
00:19:01,606 --> 00:19:03,711
I've some money. Here you go.

267
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,379
Keep it. To buy poisonâ
- Huh!

268
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:06,820
I mean to buy food.

269
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,260
Did you really think I was blind?

270
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:15,257
Sorry.
- That's okay.

271
00:19:15,753 --> 00:19:18,791
I'm an actor.
And this is my first earning.

272
00:19:20,124 --> 00:19:22,229
I am lstiyaq. And you?
- Vishwas.

273
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:23,271
I'm hereto see Yogi bhai.

274
00:19:23,528 --> 00:19:25,030
How did you know I'm
here to become an actor?

275
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,368
People come with the same
dreams to Sapna Guest House.

276
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:29,810
But do their dreams gel fulfilled?

277
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:30,845
Will I get a role?

278
00:19:31,135 --> 00:19:35,606
All one gets are dates,
dates, dates and more dates.

279
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:37,380
But no roles.

280
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:38,753
That's Vishwanath.

281
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:39,814
He's rehearsing.

282
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:41,256
Tomorrow's his date.

283
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:42,580
I mean audition.

284
00:19:43,314 --> 00:19:45,419
Who is he, lstiyaq?
- He's one of us.

285
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,058
I see. Another aspiring actor.

286
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:48,361
Vishwas.

287
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:49,295
Vishwanath.

288
00:19:56,928 --> 00:19:58,168
Guruji.

289
00:19:58,496 --> 00:19:59,566
Guruji.

290
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,079
I think he's sleeping.

291
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:06,378
No, he's thinking.

292
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,215
He's a renowned writer.

293
00:20:08,272 --> 00:20:09,512
Let's go.
- Yes.

294
00:20:10,675 --> 00:20:11,847
Who is it?

295
00:20:12,543 --> 00:20:15,080
Some Vishwas is hereto see you.

296
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,554
Hello, sir.

297
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,226
Vishwas. Come.

298
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,194
Gopi informed me that you're coming.

299
00:20:25,823 --> 00:20:26,893
Now that you've come to meâ

300
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:29,831
...you'll definitely be successful.
- Thank you.

301
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:32,738
By the way,
what films have you written?

302
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:39,582
Have you seen 'Ghajini'?
- I have.

303
00:20:40,304 --> 00:20:42,341
'Gadar'?
- I saw it twice, sir.

304
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,644
'Dhoom'?
- 'Dhoom' was a blast. I did.

305
00:20:46,677 --> 00:20:48,657
'Wanted?
- I saw it thrice, sir.

306
00:20:49,914 --> 00:20:52,326
'Dabbang?
- Of course I watched 'Dabbang'.

307
00:20:52,383 --> 00:20:53,794
I watched it umpteen times.

308
00:20:53,851 --> 00:20:55,626
Did you write all these films?

309
00:20:58,823 --> 00:21:00,302
I almost did.

310
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:04,196
I had all these ideas.

311
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:07,175
But...someone else made the films.

312
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:10,110
I didn't even write it on paper.

313
00:21:10,368 --> 00:21:12,245
I had cooked it up fresh in my mind.

314
00:21:13,137 --> 00:21:14,514
Yet they stole it.

315
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,678
That means you never wrote anything.

316
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:20,381
I will...for you.

317
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:24,152
I can see an actor in your eyes.

318
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:28,587
I can see your future.
You're going to be a superstar.

319
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:32,901
Have you brought a photo?
- Yes, sir. I did.

320
00:21:32,957 --> 00:21:34,402
Just a minute.

321
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:37,266
Here.

322
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:43,278
That's a stamp.
- It's a photo.

323
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:47,614
So small?

324
00:21:47,872 --> 00:21:49,874
It will make your future small.
- I see.

325
00:21:50,174 --> 00:21:52,916
Big. Bring a bigger photo.

326
00:21:53,878 --> 00:21:54,754
And listen.

327
00:21:55,446 --> 00:21:56,789
Get me a whiskey...

328
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,825
âwhile coming back.

329
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,328
Okay?

330
00:22:00,785 --> 00:22:01,695
Listen.

331
00:22:02,653 --> 00:22:04,189
Buy a big bottle.

332
00:22:04,755 --> 00:22:07,565
Think big,
only then can you make it big.

333
00:22:08,693 --> 00:22:14,871
""I've spent so...many
nights with this desire.""

334
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:20,541
""I've spent so...many
nights with this desire.""

335
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:25,179
""There's so much...that
I want to say.""

336
00:22:28,546 --> 00:22:29,388
How much?

337
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:31,191
She's here. She's here.

338
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:33,661
She's here. That girl's here.

339
00:22:33,718 --> 00:22:34,662
Get up everyone. Get back to work.

340
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:35,459
Get back.

341
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,863
What are you doing, sir?

342
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:38,594
Kajal's here, sir. Get up. Get up.

343
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:39,794
Kajal's here.

344
00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:42,337
Borekar, don't bore me..

345
00:22:42,393 --> 00:22:43,531
Complaint Kajal, sir.

346
00:22:43,594 --> 00:22:45,437
I think she's got a new complaint.

347
00:22:45,496 --> 00:22:46,600
Come on.

348
00:22:47,565 --> 00:22:49,169
Where's inspector Ghorpade?

349
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:51,273
Come, sir.

350
00:22:51,335 --> 00:22:52,905
Some boys are causing
vandalism outside City Mall.

351
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,449
Come right now and arrest them.

352
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:55,745
I can't come now.

353
00:22:55,806 --> 00:22:57,717
Register your complaint
like you always do.

354
00:22:57,775 --> 00:22:58,685
And then I'll take action.

355
00:22:58,743 --> 00:23:00,313
Don't you see I am busy?

356
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:01,755
Yes, I can see how busy you are.

357
00:23:01,812 --> 00:23:03,155
First learn to hold
the FIR book correctly.

358
00:23:03,214 --> 00:23:04,215
And come with me.

359
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,558
Otherwise I'll complain to the ACP.

360
00:23:06,617 --> 00:23:07,823
Additional Commissioner.

361
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,860
<i>M. Commissioner Khare, sir.
- Madamâ</i>

362
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,559
The Commissionerâ
- Madam, madamâ

363
00:23:11,622 --> 00:23:12,623
Have a glass of water.

364
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:13,691
Sir, better hurry up.

365
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:15,169
The speed at which she's going..

366
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:17,433
âShe'll definitely
gel to the CM or PM.

367
00:23:17,495 --> 00:23:18,269
So what have you decided?

368
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:20,172
What have we decided?
- We'll arrest them.

369
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:21,175
And we'll do it now.

370
00:23:21,632 --> 00:23:23,373
Boys.
- Yes, sir!

371
00:23:23,434 --> 00:23:25,744
We've to arrest some
hooligans outside City Mall.

372
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,706
Follow me.
- Sir.

373
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,844
Do you recognise all of them?

374
00:23:30,141 --> 00:23:31,347
One of them is the Counselloï¬s son.

375
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:32,285
Ashok Pure.

376
00:23:32,343 --> 00:23:33,378
Ashokâ

377
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:34,883
Well, let's see.

378
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:37,420
And the other is MLA
Gulab Thakur's nephew.

379
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:38,585
Lal Thakur.

380
00:23:39,183 --> 00:23:40,218
Him too?

381
00:23:40,284 --> 00:23:41,228
We'll try.

382
00:23:41,285 --> 00:23:42,889
And Gudappa Das' brother-in-law.

383
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:44,524
Dharam Prakash. DP.

384
00:23:44,855 --> 00:23:45,856
Then I'll have to think about it.

385
00:23:46,157 --> 00:23:46,897
What did you say?

386
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,494
Borekar.
- Yes, sir.

387
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,335
The goons have threatened
to kill your father today, right?

388
00:23:51,395 --> 00:23:53,432
Sir, my father's already..
- Your fatherâ

389
00:23:53,497 --> 00:23:55,170
âthat lives in the room above.

390
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,645
Try to understand, Borekar?
- Yes. Yes.

391
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:00,842
We'll deal with those goons later.

392
00:24:00,905 --> 00:24:03,511
First we need to
save Borekar's father.

393
00:24:03,574 --> 00:24:05,178
Boys.
- Yes, sir.

394
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:06,085
Follow me.

395
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,589
Let's go, sir.

396
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:10,824
I get it, Inspector.

397
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,427
You're evading your duty.

398
00:24:12,516 --> 00:24:14,689
But there must be one
brave inspector in the city.

399
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:15,761
I am there.

400
00:24:17,488 --> 00:24:18,466
I'm shooting.

401
00:24:21,826 --> 00:24:23,772
The law has long arms.

402
00:24:27,898 --> 00:24:29,502
That wasn't a pose.

403
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,514
Yes, mom.
- Son. How are you?

404
00:24:33,571 --> 00:24:34,641
Absolutely fine, mom.

405
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:37,350
What's the progress on
your admission in the police

406
00:24:37,408 --> 00:24:39,718
Yes...yes, mom.
I'm preparing for that.

407
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:43,257
Good. Good.
Give me the good news, soon.

408
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:44,190
Of course I will, mom.

409
00:24:44,248 --> 00:24:45,852
And look after yourself.

410
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:49,295
And keep calling...whenever
you get the time.

411
00:24:49,353 --> 00:24:51,458
Good thing we got pictures
of you in two getups.

412
00:24:51,522 --> 00:24:52,728
Yes, that's great.

413
00:24:53,157 --> 00:24:55,569
Where are my clothes?

414
00:24:56,327 --> 00:24:57,601
Where could they go?

415
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,573
Were you wearing clothes
when you came in?

416
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:01,268
You think I came in nude?

417
00:25:01,332 --> 00:25:03,835
Don't get angry,
you will get your clothes back.

418
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:06,279
Wear this. This is the new
'Kathiawadi' (traditional) dress.

419
00:25:06,337 --> 00:25:07,247
It'll look nice on you.

420
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,683
If I wear this outside,
people will think I'm crazy.

421
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,276
Then wear what you're wearing now.

422
00:25:11,342 --> 00:25:12,753
People will salute you.

423
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,847
You want my scooter
for few days, right?

424
00:25:14,912 --> 00:25:15,583
Take it.

425
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:27,198
Let's go, quickly.
- Who are you?

426
00:25:27,258 --> 00:25:29,704
Follow that black car.
- But I..

427
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,330
Stop talking, let's go.

428
00:25:31,395 --> 00:25:33,204
A girl's being abducted
in that black car.

429
00:25:33,264 --> 00:25:34,334
You don't understand.

430
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:35,672
This is no time to talk, Inspector.

431
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:37,542
It's time for action.
Let's go, quickly.

432
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,739
Help!

433
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:42,580
That car's speeding away, hurry up.

434
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,348
Look, you're mistakenâ
- No, I'm not.

435
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:48,720
I heard it myself.
The girl was yelling, ""Help! Help!""

436
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:50,258
It means the girl's in danger.

437
00:25:50,314 --> 00:25:51,349
Drive faster.

438
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:53,292
There is the car.

439
00:25:53,617 --> 00:25:55,460
Help!
- Keep quite.

440
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:56,862
Somebody help me.

441
00:25:56,921 --> 00:25:58,764
There's a police inspector
following us, sir.

442
00:25:58,823 --> 00:25:59,824
What nonsense!

443
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,301
Inspector Ghorpade saidâ

444
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,635
...there won't be any policeman there.

445
00:26:04,128 --> 00:26:05,505
Okay. Calm down. Calm down.

446
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:08,407
I know, show my photo
to the inspector.

447
00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:13,513
How dare he?

448
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,845
He's showing you his boss' photo.

449
00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:16,209
He's mocking you.

450
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:18,318
We will catch them now.

451
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,356
We won't spare them.
Driver faster. Faster.

452
00:26:24,915 --> 00:26:26,360
Why are you taking wrong way,
Inspector?

453
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,358
He changed route seeing your photo.

454
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,790
Very good. Very good.

455
00:26:31,255 --> 00:26:33,360
Sir, the girl's going that
way and you're going thisâ

456
00:26:33,424 --> 00:26:35,597
What kind of an inspector are you?
- I'm no inspector.

457
00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:37,229
There goes the real inspector.

458
00:26:37,294 --> 00:26:38,705
Lion-heart inspector.

459
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,141
Who?
- Inspector Chulbul Pandeyl

460
00:26:41,198 --> 00:26:43,701
Robinhood Salman Khan!

461
00:26:45,936 --> 00:26:47,472
Sir, there's a policeman following us.

462
00:26:47,538 --> 00:26:49,484
Police? What now?

463
00:26:50,274 --> 00:26:51,412
Did you jump a signal?
- No, sir.

464
00:26:51,475 --> 00:26:52,852
PUC? - It's there.
Insurance? - It's there.

465
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,888
License?
- It's there.

466
00:26:53,944 --> 00:26:54,888
Do you want me to speed up?

467
00:26:54,945 --> 00:26:56,481
Do you wish to take me to the moon?

468
00:26:56,547 --> 00:26:59,619
'Wanted',
'Baht-pang', 'Ready', 'Ek Tha Tiger'.

469
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:00,822
What a body.

470
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,091
Fantastic fighter.

What happened, sir?

475

I'm a big fan.
- I see. Thank you.

476
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,477
Can I get an autograph?
- Of course.

477
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:22,847
Hey, hold on to this.

478
00:27:26,744 --> 00:27:27,620
Careful.

479
00:27:29,513 --> 00:27:31,618
Your name?
- Vishwas.

480
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,356
Her name?

481
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:39,095
Her name?
- Don't know.

482
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:42,499
Kajal.

483
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,561
Kajal.

484
00:27:44,428 --> 00:27:47,102
Very nice. To Vishwas and Kajal.

485
00:27:47,364 --> 00:27:48,775
Here.
- Thank you, bhai.

486
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:49,868
Thank you.
- Welcome.

487
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,511
Someday I will be like you.
- Of course.

488
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,141
Of course, you sure can.
- Bye.

489
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,753
Why would he become like me?

490
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,352
I pose as inspector in films.

491
00:28:04,281 --> 00:28:06,022
And this inspector
wants to be a movie star.

492
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,798
Anyone can be a hero these days.

493
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:11,292
He can too.

494
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,669
Listen, take me to
Rajkumar Santoshfs office.

495
00:28:17,094 --> 00:28:19,301
The narration of 'Andaz
Apna Apna-2' is in progress.

496
00:28:21,298 --> 00:28:22,140
Oh no!

497
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:24,437
Aamir again.

498
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:29,778
He looks more handsome in real life.

499
00:28:30,741 --> 00:28:32,652
The black car's heading this way.

500
00:28:35,813 --> 00:28:37,759
That inspector turned
out to be really smart, sir.

501
00:28:38,282 --> 00:28:40,387
He took a short-cut and cut us off.

502
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:42,863
What? What are you
still thinking about?

503
00:28:43,153 --> 00:28:44,257
Get out of there.

504
00:28:46,557 --> 00:28:48,798
Forget the girl.
Take the photo and make a run for it.

505
00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:52,272
You goons. Where are you going?
- Run. Run. Run.

506
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:54,275
Sir, we scared them off.

507
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,647
Thank you, sister. You saved me.

508
00:28:59,703 --> 00:29:01,148
Not me, he did.

509
00:29:01,405 --> 00:29:03,214
Thank him. He saved you.

510
00:29:03,474 --> 00:29:05,613
Thank you officer, for saving me.

511
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:06,820
I am Suman Thappa.

00:29:09,613 --> 00:29:11,024
Sister, please give me your phone.

Thank you.

515

Sir, forgive me.

516
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:18,165
I misunderstood you.
- You still misunderstand me..

517
00:29:18,222 --> 00:29:20,498
No, no, now I know you very well.

518
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:21,798
Salman Khan was just an excuse.

519
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:24,504
Actually, you wanted to take
a short-cut and cut them off. Right?

520
00:29:25,129 --> 00:29:27,803
You're the first brave and honest
officer I've come across in the city.

521
00:29:28,198 --> 00:29:29,506
I'm really impressed.

522
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:30,541

How much more money do you want?

Like I said I don't know
that inspectorâ - Don't lie to me.

526
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:54,158
There was a time,
when police officers were honest.

527
00:29:54,825 --> 00:29:56,498
They had character.

528
00:29:57,394 --> 00:29:58,839
We would grease their palmsâ

529
00:29:59,296 --> 00:30:01,435

No need to talk.

I really don't know who he is, sir.

536
00:30:18,248 --> 00:30:19,784
Lying again.

537
00:30:21,318 --> 00:30:22,160
Biscuit.

538
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:25,730
You won't make this mistake again.

539
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:26,631
Yes, sir,

540
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:29,696
Sir...

541
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:34,733
...maybe that inspector's
one of Chinappa Das' man.

542
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:36,376
Right.

543
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:37,878
You're right, Ghorpade.

544
00:30:38,168 --> 00:30:39,545
Thank you, sir.
- Biscuit.

545
00:30:44,975 --> 00:30:47,216
So you are wearing Vishwas' clothes.

546
00:30:47,511 --> 00:30:49,787
If you keep this up,
someday you'll be defamed.

547
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:53,684
""Munni was defamed,
darling only for you.""

548
00:30:54,218 --> 00:30:55,288
I'm from the Daily Paper.

549
00:30:55,552 --> 00:30:57,429
Mr. Lalwani was supposed
to give me a photograph.

550
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:59,866
Daddy, someone's here
from the Daily Paper.

551
00:30:59,923 --> 00:31:01,869
Yes. Give him the inspector's photo.

552
00:31:01,925 --> 00:31:03,666
It's kept ready on the table.
- Ready?

553
00:31:14,304 --> 00:31:16,443
Stop, sister. Stop.

554
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:17,812
Good news.

555
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:20,219
Vishwas has become
a police inspector. - What?

556
00:31:20,277 --> 00:31:22,257
Look, his photo's been
published in the papers.

557
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:24,893
What's written in it?
- I don't know.

558
00:31:25,182 --> 00:31:26,183
The paper's torn.

559
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,389
I got my hands on it in the temple.

560
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,696
Hail Goddess Durgal
- Yes, Lord.

561
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,794
My son's become a police inspector.

562
00:31:34,191 --> 00:31:35,727
Take this. You take too.

563
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,830
My son's become a police inspector.

564
00:31:38,262 --> 00:31:39,866
My son's become a police inspector.

565
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:41,339
Thief I

566
00:31:41,965 --> 00:31:43,410
Thief I Thief I

567
00:31:43,734 --> 00:31:44,474
Thief I

568
00:31:45,736 --> 00:31:48,876
He won't stop if you yell ""Thief"".
- Then what do we do?

569
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:50,646
Shout ""Police"", they will nab him.
- Yes.

570
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:51,618
Police! Police! Police!

571
00:31:51,675 --> 00:31:53,916
All you need is one breakâ

572
00:31:53,977 --> 00:31:56,287
âand you will be a movie star.

573
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,520
Like this.

574
00:31:57,881 --> 00:31:59,451
Movie star?

575
00:31:59,983 --> 00:32:00,654
Like this?

576
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,129
Police!

577
00:32:05,622 --> 00:32:07,226
You're fantastic, sir.

578
00:32:07,591 --> 00:32:10,470
No, no, it was a mistakeâ
- No, mistake.

579
00:32:10,527 --> 00:32:12,165
Throwing that peel was just an excuse.

580
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:15,210
You wanted to catch the
thief without laying a finger.

581
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,474
He's a police officer.

582
00:32:17,534 --> 00:32:18,774
Honest. Brave.

583
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:19,712
Thank you, Officer.

584
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:22,376
This Gundappa Das' thug
was fleeing with my diamonds.

585
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:25,477
Which station should Hake him to?
- Take him to anyone.

586
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:26,850
Heard that. Take him away.

587
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:28,485
Come on! Come.

588
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:29,780
Fantastic, sir.

589
00:32:30,147 --> 00:32:32,388
You're always at the crime-scene.

590
00:32:32,449 --> 00:32:34,258
But you arrive before me.

591
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:40,800
I am Kajal.
- I am Vishwas.

592
00:32:41,358 --> 00:32:42,132
Sir.

593
00:32:47,197 --> 00:32:49,905
She looks like a heroine.
- Yes, she does.

594
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,238
But she can't be yours.
- Why?

595
00:32:53,537 --> 00:32:54,743
She's a Mumbai girl.

596
00:32:54,805 --> 00:32:56,375
She'll giggle while talking.

597
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,748
But if you try to flirt with herâ

598
00:32:58,275 --> 00:32:59,777

600
00:33:02,346 --> 00:33:06,089
So don't love her, don't follow her.

601
00:33:06,483 --> 00:33:07,427
Come on, follow me.

602
00:33:11,822 --> 00:33:15,599
""Let's make deal of our love.""

Touch sir's feet.

674
00:37:33,817 --> 00:37:35,455
Al least say hello.

Hello, sir. I'm Vishwas Rao.

676

As soon as you step out of
the swimming pool.. - Sir, please!

679
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,881
Give me one chance.
- What's this, Yogi?

680
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:55,246
Just give him one chance, just once.

681
00:37:55,305 --> 00:37:56,784
He's a good actor. He'll do good.

682
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,115
This role won't suit him.

683
00:37:59,476 --> 00:38:00,147
Okay?

684
00:38:03,246 --> 00:38:04,350

As soon as you step out of
the swimming pool.. - Sir, please!

I will act well.

687
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:16,361
Look, this role is of a bad character.

688
00:38:16,693 --> 00:38:18,366
You look more like a good character.

689
00:38:18,628 --> 00:38:21,302
You can't do it. Okay.

690
00:38:22,265 --> 00:38:23,403
Goodbye.

At least see my acting first.

695
00:38:35,545 --> 00:38:38,424
Sir, when am I coming out of the pool?

696
00:38:38,815 --> 00:38:40,317
You will. You will.

697
00:38:42,552 --> 00:38:43,860
What are these?

698
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:46,294
What are these?

699
00:38:47,157 --> 00:38:48,135
Eyes, sir.

700
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:49,636
They are cameras.

701
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:52,300
I can tell what one can, or cannot do.

702
00:38:52,362 --> 00:38:53,636
You cannot do it.

703
00:38:53,697 --> 00:38:56,200
Go. Get out!
- No, sir..

Hey, misterâ

You were wrong.

714
00:39:24,728 --> 00:39:26,230
You shouldn't have insulted my mother.

715
00:39:27,497 --> 00:39:29,170
She's a mother after all..
- Stop thisâ

716
00:39:29,232 --> 00:39:30,233
Quiet!

717
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,211
He came here for job.

718
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:33,748
He didn't come hereto beg you.

719
00:39:36,473 --> 00:39:38,180
I wanted to become an actor.

720
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:40,811
It was my childhood dream.

721
00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:43,585
I thought I would come to Mumbai,
work hardâ

722
00:39:44,748 --> 00:39:46,352
Carve a niche for myself.

723
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:47,417
But this stupidâ.

724
00:39:47,484 --> 00:39:49,259
âIs in a hurry to
get her out of the pool.

725
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:50,764
That's why he's throwing us out!

726
00:39:53,456 --> 00:39:56,062
Let's go, Vishwas, he..
- What did I say to him?

727
00:39:56,526 --> 00:39:59,473
I said ""Give me a chance.
Give me a chance to act"".

728
00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:00,701
He says, ""These are..""

729
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:06,409
<i>plasma-l</i>

730
00:40:06,469 --> 00:40:07,539
What did you say?

731
00:40:09,506 --> 00:40:10,450
What are these?

732
00:40:11,908 --> 00:40:12,818
What are these?

733
00:40:12,876 --> 00:40:13,820
What are these?

734
00:40:14,277 --> 00:40:17,884
Eyes.
- No. Camera.

735
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:20,684
Yes. Camera.

736
00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:24,230
You can see everything.

737
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:28,329
so...what am I going to do?
- What?

738
00:40:28,391 --> 00:40:30,132
Say it, otherwise your cameraâ

739
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:33,336
Sir, is this bad enough?

740
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:36,578
What?
- You said it's a bad character.

741
00:40:38,368 --> 00:40:39,870
Acting?
- Yes, sir.

742
00:40:40,403 --> 00:40:41,245
Good.

743
00:40:41,638 --> 00:40:44,619
I can be worse, sir.
- No, no. Good.

744
00:40:44,674 --> 00:40:46,620
Bad. Good. Bad.

745
00:40:46,676 --> 00:40:47,654
Goodâ

746
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:50,521
Very good. Very good.

747
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,490
Selected.

748
00:40:52,282 --> 00:40:53,488
Great, sir.

749
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,791
What happened?
- He got the role.

750
00:40:57,854 --> 00:40:59,356
He's a star now. Star.

751
00:40:59,923 --> 00:41:01,061
The phone's ringing.

752
00:41:01,324 --> 00:41:03,201
It's ringing. Answer it.

753
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,538
Yes, mom. How are you?

754
00:41:07,597 --> 00:41:10,100
I never thought you'll do this to me.

755
00:41:11,534 --> 00:41:13,070
I know everything.

756
00:41:13,937 --> 00:41:15,439
Sorry, mom, I..
- Be quiet.

757
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,614
You got selected as a police
officer and didn't tell me.

758
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,856
Police officer?
- Enough.

759
00:41:22,912 --> 00:41:24,482
Stop with your charades.

760
00:41:24,547 --> 00:41:26,891
I saw your photo in the paper.

761
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,861
In the police uniform.
- Photo?

762
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:30,524
Police?

763
00:41:30,587 --> 00:41:32,328
I am coming to Mumbai
day-after-tomorrow.

764
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:33,732
For three days.
- What?

765
00:41:34,224 --> 00:41:36,704
I've a desire to see
you in the police uniform.

766
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:38,702
To see you doing your duty.

767
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:40,799
My train will arrive at 3 o'clock.
Pick me up from the station.

768
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:46,404
No, Guru. I can't do it.

769
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,807
I've already lied to mother before.

770
00:41:48,872 --> 00:41:50,317
I've hurt her once.

771
00:41:50,573 --> 00:41:52,143
I can't hurt her anymore.

772
00:41:52,442 --> 00:41:54,149
You've great sentiments.

773
00:41:54,577 --> 00:41:55,885
Tomorrow when she finds out thatâ

774
00:41:56,179 --> 00:41:58,819
...you're preparing to be an actor,
not a police officer..

775
00:41:58,882 --> 00:42:00,691
âDo you think it'll make her happy?

776
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:01,854
What do I do, Guru?

777
00:42:02,218 --> 00:42:03,822
What do I do?
- Just do as I said.

778
00:42:03,887 --> 00:42:05,525
Just pose as a police inspectorâ

779
00:42:05,588 --> 00:42:07,226
...in front of your mother, that's it.

780
00:42:07,924 --> 00:42:10,234
Just like Sanjay Dutt posed
as a doctor in 'Munnabhai'?

781
00:42:10,293 --> 00:42:13,604
Exactly, son. Same to same.

782
00:42:14,197 --> 00:42:15,540
Mom's coming home for three days.

783
00:42:15,598 --> 00:42:18,841
We'll borrow a house, jeep
and a police uniform for few days.

784
00:42:18,902 --> 00:42:22,509
You just have to pretend
that you're a police inspector.

785
00:42:22,572 --> 00:42:24,779
Guru, this will give us
a chance to act as well. - Right.

786
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:27,412
We'll act really well, Guru.
- Right.

787
00:42:27,477 --> 00:42:29,650
And I'll do the best
acting of my life.

788
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,784
See. Everything's very good.

789
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:03,458
No. Don't touch my feet
while you're still in uniform.

790
00:43:03,513 --> 00:43:04,548
Respect it.

791
00:43:04,614 --> 00:43:05,524
Give it to me.

792
00:43:06,883 --> 00:43:09,591
What happened, mom?
- Nothing.

793
00:43:09,652 --> 00:43:10,824
Nothing.

794
00:43:11,554 --> 00:43:13,659
How are you?
- I'm fine.

795
00:43:13,723 --> 00:43:15,100
How are you?
- Me?

796
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,437
Inspector Vishwas Rao.
- Hello, Father Anthony Gonzalez.

797
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:23,705
God bless you, my child.
God bless you.

798
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,872
You did a splendid
job by closing down..

799
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:29,217
âThe bars and gambling
dens in our area.

800
00:43:29,272 --> 00:43:30,774
That's my duty, Father.

801
00:43:31,608 --> 00:43:35,454
I'm so proud of you, my child!

802
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:40,894
A honest, loyal, capable,
talented police officer like you..

803
00:43:41,351 --> 00:43:43,456
âCan't be in our area.

804
00:43:43,953 --> 00:43:49,904
Inspector Vishwas. I would
like to...meet your mom, just once.

805
00:43:50,393 --> 00:43:51,531
She's my mom, Father.

806
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:56,875
I am so lucky to be meeting you.

807
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,907
How many sons do you have?

808
00:43:59,335 --> 00:44:00,837
I have just one son.

809
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:03,845
How sad. How very sad.

810
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,711
Why didn't you have
some more children? - What?

811
00:44:06,776 --> 00:44:08,119
It would've been in
the interest of the country.

812
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:10,852
You're just great to give
birth to an officer like him.

813
00:44:11,247 --> 00:44:12,692
Bless me, O mother!

814
00:44:13,249 --> 00:44:15,354
He's taking her blessings.

815
00:44:16,252 --> 00:44:18,732
Bless me so that next
time I can be your son..

816
00:44:18,788 --> 00:44:20,290
âAnd a brave officer like him.

817
00:44:20,356 --> 00:44:21,767
Make my country proud. Make the police
department proud. - Excuse me, lady.

818
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,601
Is that your bag?
The red and yellow. - No, no.

819
00:44:24,661 --> 00:44:25,639
Okay, thank you.

820
00:44:27,897 --> 00:44:31,868
Son, where's the priest?
- Mom. It was time for his prayers.

821
00:44:33,603 --> 00:44:34,638
Go on, son.

822
00:44:35,772 --> 00:44:37,376
Don't disgrace your Guru.

823
00:44:41,277 --> 00:44:42,779
Hello, sir.
- Hello.

824
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:46,692
Sir. Is she your mother?
- Yes. She is.

825
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:48,821
Hello, madam.

826
00:44:49,285 --> 00:44:52,095
I want to be honest with you.

827

Your sonâ
- Yes.

828
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:57,296
Your son...isn't a police officer.
- What?

829
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:59,403
He's not a police officer.
- What are you saying?

830
00:44:59,462 --> 00:45:00,406
He's God.

831
00:45:01,264 --> 00:45:02,743
God, dressed in a uniform.

832
00:45:03,132 --> 00:45:08,741
You risked your life alone,
lo protect us helpless..

833
00:45:09,172 --> 00:45:11,618
âAnd drove out 50 goons.

834
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:15,288
And you thrashed them so hard that.

835
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:16,119
How?

836
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:17,658
He thrashes them so hardâ

837
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:19,625
...the other goons fled for
their lives hearing them scream.

838
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:23,354
You are...the protector of the poor.

839
00:45:23,753 --> 00:45:26,529
You...are just!

840
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:29,768
You are...the pride of our country.

841
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,671
""May our flag always soar high.""

842
00:45:34,597 --> 00:45:37,806
""The pride and glory of our country.""

843
00:45:37,867 --> 00:45:41,144
""May our flag always soar high.""

844
00:45:41,204 --> 00:45:43,684
Before he goes up the
Red Fort with the flagâ

845
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:44,775
Bring him down?
- Hmmm.

846
00:45:44,841 --> 00:45:45,876
Coolie.
- Yes.

847
00:45:45,942 --> 00:45:49,685
O Inspector.
I'll build a shrine for you.

848
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:52,352
Aunt. I'll keep you there too.

849
00:45:52,415 --> 00:45:53,189
What?

850
00:45:53,249 --> 00:45:55,593
And...worship you bothâ

851
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:02,333
Aunt, are those black
and yellow bags yours? - No.

852
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:03,496
Sorry.

853
00:46:03,826 --> 00:46:05,567
Where is he?

854
00:46:05,628 --> 00:46:07,733
Mom, it was time for him to pray.

855
00:46:07,797 --> 00:46:08,832
Come, mom.

856
00:46:14,337 --> 00:46:16,180
One minutes.

857
00:46:17,807 --> 00:46:18,615
Do fast.

858
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:22,621
Some on help.

859
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:25,057
What's going on?

860
00:46:25,348 --> 00:46:26,190
Where, mom?

861
00:46:27,116 --> 00:46:29,460
Look. Some goons are beating them up.

862
00:46:30,453 --> 00:46:31,830
Where, mom?

863
00:46:33,256 --> 00:46:35,099
Not there, here.

864
00:46:36,259 --> 00:46:40,298
Save me, Inspector.
- Sir. Sir.

865
00:46:40,563 --> 00:46:41,735
They are calling you.
- No, no.

866
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:44,438
Mom...they aren't calling me,
but their area's inspector.

867
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,138
Mister, hurry up.
- Done, sir.

868
00:46:46,202 --> 00:46:48,409
Go take a look.
- I can't go, mom.

869
00:46:48,471 --> 00:46:49,677
This isn't my area.

870
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:52,776
Hurry up. - You mind your area,
and I'll deal with them.

871
00:46:52,842 --> 00:46:53,752
Mom.

872
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:54,652
Mom.

873
00:46:54,911 --> 00:46:55,855
Mom.

874
00:46:57,413 --> 00:46:58,255
Move back.

875
00:46:58,581 --> 00:46:59,423
Stop.

876
00:46:59,482 --> 00:47:00,392
Who are you, woman?

877
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:03,355
I'm the inspector's mother.

878
00:47:03,419 --> 00:47:04,727
Mom, what are you doing? Let's go.

879
00:47:04,787 --> 00:47:07,233
Inspector. Are you new in the area?

880
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,133
What would you do if he was old?

881
00:47:09,192 --> 00:47:10,193
Mom, wait.

882
00:47:10,259 --> 00:47:13,536
Inspector, we've been running
this school for 60 years.

883
00:47:13,796 --> 00:47:17,243
And now Gudappa Das'
henchmen want to force us out.

884
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,644
They want to build a dance bar here.

885
00:47:20,303 --> 00:47:21,805
Are you done? You heard enough?

886
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:23,778
Once the bar opens you
can come have free food.

887
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,841
Get going-

888
00:47:24,907 --> 00:47:27,251
Vishwas. What's he saying?
- Yesâ

889
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:29,483
How dare you scold
me in front of my mother?

890
00:47:29,545 --> 00:47:33,118
Not just that,
he's scolding you, a police officer.

891
00:47:33,182 --> 00:47:36,595
Yes, mom. I'm a police inspector.

892
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:37,688
What's your name?

893
00:47:38,187 --> 00:47:41,293
Stupid. Insects like you..

894
00:47:41,357 --> 00:47:44,531
...know me for my fist, not my name.

895
00:47:49,832 --> 00:47:51,709
Good one, mom?
- First class.

896
00:47:57,173 --> 00:47:59,813
Stop that and thrash him.
- I will.

897
00:48:00,243 --> 00:48:01,654
What did you say?
- Get lost!

898
00:48:01,711 --> 00:48:02,485
Get lost!

899
00:50:23,152 --> 00:50:24,290
This is our house, mom.

900
00:50:24,353 --> 00:50:25,832
Isn't it first class?

901
00:50:26,689 --> 00:50:30,569
Wow! You've such a big house.

902
00:50:30,626 --> 00:50:33,232
No, mom. Not the one downstairs.
That's closed.

903
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:34,832
We've just rented the top floor.

904
00:50:35,598 --> 00:50:37,703
Rented?
- No, aunt. Let me tell you.

905
00:50:37,767 --> 00:50:41,442
Sir means the government
has rented out the room to him.

906
00:50:41,504 --> 00:50:43,745
Do you get it?
Because they're happy with his work.

907
00:50:43,806 --> 00:50:46,878
Of course.
My son's done such a good job.

908
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,923
The government's got to be pleased.

909
00:50:49,645 --> 00:50:51,716
Very good. Very, very, good.

910
00:50:52,782 --> 00:50:54,386
Ghorpade.
- Yes, sir.

911
00:50:54,784 --> 00:50:57,890
Which new officer did you
train in your police stationâ

912
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:00,460
âthat's doing such
a great job in your area?

913
00:51:01,123 --> 00:51:03,660
The other day he saved
a girl from abduction.

914
00:51:04,427 --> 00:51:06,498
Then he apprehended the thief.

915
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,776
And today he thrashed
Gundappa's goons.

916
00:51:09,832 --> 00:51:10,867
Single-handedly.

917
00:51:11,434 --> 00:51:12,538
I am impressed.

918
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:16,743
Sir, I..
- Of course.

919
00:51:16,806 --> 00:51:19,252
I will put in a recommendation
for your promotion.

920
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:20,779
<i>L am very hï¬PPY-</i>

921
00:51:20,843 --> 00:51:23,881
Sir, he reallyâ
- You really have done a good job.

922
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,688
I will put in a
recommendation for your..

923
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:30,562
Borekar. What's this?

924
00:51:30,853 --> 00:51:32,833
You had moustaches, didn't you?

925
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,493
I still do, sir.

926
00:51:39,428 --> 00:51:41,374
Well. Gentlemen.

927
00:51:42,932 --> 00:51:44,434
There's bad news.

928
00:51:45,568 --> 00:51:47,673
Napoleon's coming to Mumbai.

929
00:51:48,938 --> 00:51:52,886
Interpol's sent us some
photographs of Napoleon.

930
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,483
Take a close look at these photosâ

931
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:57,619
âand recognise him well.

932
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:05,323
Did you get a good look?

933
00:52:08,424 --> 00:52:09,232
Good!

934
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,465
Smuggling. Drugs. Terrorism.

935
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:14,640
Napoleon takes
contracts for all these.

936
00:52:14,897 --> 00:52:17,173
According to the information
received from RAW..

937
00:52:17,233 --> 00:52:18,837
âHe's coming to Mumbai soon.

938
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:21,581
To execute a dangerous mission.

939
00:52:21,637 --> 00:52:25,175
And his mission's called
'Mission While Elephant'.

940
00:52:25,841 --> 00:52:30,256
We've to thwart 'Mission
White Elephant' at any cost.

941
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,486
And we've to catch Napoleon alive..

942
00:52:32,748 --> 00:52:35,228
âAnd make Mumbai police proud.

943
00:52:35,651 --> 00:52:36,493
Andâ

944
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:40,394
Let's catch him first.

945
00:52:42,491 --> 00:52:45,734
Guru. How did you like mom's cooking?
- Fantastic.

946
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:47,866
I say let's gel some
for dinner as well.

947
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:48,874
Hot vegetables.

948
00:52:49,198 --> 00:52:51,872
I'm eating your cooked
food after so long.

949
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:53,272
Feels so nice.

950
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,440
But, mom.
It would've been so much betterâ

951
00:52:54,503 --> 00:52:55,777
...if you could stay for few more days.

952
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:57,515
Why did you come for just three days?

953
00:52:57,573 --> 00:52:59,814
Yes, son.
I was thinking the same thing.

954
00:53:04,413 --> 00:53:05,187
Water.

955
00:53:05,247 --> 00:53:07,591
But, mom. How can you stay back here?

956
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:09,687
You've things to do
back in the village. - Yes.

957
00:53:09,752 --> 00:53:10,730
No, son.

958
00:53:10,786 --> 00:53:12,163
When you're insistingâ

959
00:53:12,221 --> 00:53:13,757
âthen I'll stay
a few months with you.

960
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:17,464
Yes, yes. Of course.

961
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,737
Butâ
- Mind your duty, sir.

962
00:53:19,795 --> 00:53:20,830
How can you stay back?

963
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:23,770
Three days later you've to
leave with the CM for three months.

964
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:26,143
For security reasons.
- Yes.

965
00:53:26,769 --> 00:53:29,648
No. I'll refuse the CM.

966
00:53:29,905 --> 00:53:32,886
I'll tell him, ""My mom's arrived from
the village, so I'm slaying with her"".

967
00:53:33,175 --> 00:53:37,089
Right, mom.
- Duty comes first, mother later.

968
00:53:37,413 --> 00:53:39,450
Don't worry about me.
I'll come visit you again.

969
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:43,794
She's saying she'll
come visit you again.

970
00:53:50,726 --> 00:53:52,467
Good morning, sir.. Evening?

971
00:53:52,528 --> 00:53:54,371
Afternoon, sir.
- You called?

972
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:56,910
You sent that inspector again,
Ghorpadeâ

973
00:53:56,966 --> 00:53:59,446
âto beat-up my men.

974
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:00,606
Sir, I've told you before.

975
00:54:00,669 --> 00:54:03,809
He's not one of usâ
- Lying again.

976
00:54:04,106 --> 00:54:06,848
Why don't you just say
how much money do you want?

977
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:08,417
I don't want money, sir?
- So?

978
00:54:08,677 --> 00:54:10,179
Do you want property this time?

979
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:12,624
No, sir. I mean...l don't
know who the inspector is.

980
00:54:12,681 --> 00:54:15,252
Sir, that inspector
thrashed us really bad.

981
00:54:15,317 --> 00:54:16,523
He jumped kicked us.

982
00:54:16,585 --> 00:54:18,258
He made us run for our lives, sir.

983
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,163
Look. He thrashed them so badly.

984
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:24,432
He beat Madan black and blue.
- Sir, I'm Mohan.

985
00:54:24,693 --> 00:54:26,536
He's beat them up so badly.

986
00:54:26,595 --> 00:54:29,838
You can't make out who's Madan,
who's Mohan.

987
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:31,537
We're going back to our village, sir.

988
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,670
See, Ghorpade.

989
00:54:32,735 --> 00:54:33,873
Half of them are heading
back to their villageâ

990
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,478
âand the other half
are in the hospital.

991
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:37,540
Mission White Elephant
is in its final stages.

992
00:54:37,606 --> 00:54:41,281
Sir.. - Either you drag
him here by his foot or his hair..

993
00:54:41,343 --> 00:54:47,294
âBut bring him to me,
or else I'll skin you alive.

994
00:54:48,884 --> 00:54:49,862
What?

995
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:52,331
Director Anees Bazmi's
given an appointment?

996
00:54:52,388 --> 00:54:55,335
<i>Yes, knees Bazmi.
- Green, Guru.</i>

997
00:54:55,391 --> 00:54:56,734
I'll be right there.

998
00:54:56,792 --> 00:54:59,568
Just don't let Anees leave.
- Who is Anees?

999
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:03,310
Anees is a very big movieâ
- Movie?

1000
00:55:03,632 --> 00:55:04,736
Don.

1001
00:55:05,334 --> 00:55:06,472
He's a don.

1002
00:55:06,535 --> 00:55:07,843
Just like there are
dangerous villains in films..

1003
00:55:08,137 --> 00:55:09,775
âSimilarly, they are real life dons.

1004
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:11,479
We finally managed
to get a grip on them.

1005
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:12,650
I mean, find them.

1006
00:55:12,708 --> 00:55:15,154
So...I'll go make a plan to catch him.
Give me your blessings.

1007
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:29,794
No need to worry.
I've found out everything.

1008
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:32,738
Joint commissioner Khare's
home is undergoing repairs.

1009
00:55:32,795 --> 00:55:36,572
So he's rented the ground floor
of your home for a month. That's it.

1010
00:55:36,632 --> 00:55:40,205
Guru. If that joint commissioner
sees me in uniform..

1011
00:55:40,269 --> 00:55:41,680
âHe'll throw me in jail.

1012
00:55:41,737 --> 00:55:42,875
That won't happen.

1013
00:55:42,938 --> 00:55:44,815
Just do as you were
doing until now. Acting..

1014
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:46,217
Silence.

1015
00:55:49,845 --> 00:55:51,256
Hello, sir.
- Hello.

1016
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:54,327
My son's a police inspector too.

1017
00:55:54,383 --> 00:55:56,590
We live on the upper floor.
- I see.

1018
00:55:56,852 --> 00:55:58,763
Yes. He just joined the police force.

1019
00:55:59,421 --> 00:56:02,459
He's closed down many bars
and gambling dens. - I see.

1020
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:05,498
And he beat up some
criminals so badlyâ

1021
00:56:05,561 --> 00:56:09,065
...that the other goons fled
the city hearing their screams.

1022
00:56:10,566 --> 00:56:11,840
What's his name?

1023
00:56:12,868 --> 00:56:14,370
Vishwas Rao.

1024
00:56:15,604 --> 00:56:19,074
He's after some Don.. Yes.

1025
00:56:19,408 --> 00:56:22,821
He's planning to apprehend
some don called Anees.

1026
00:56:22,878 --> 00:56:23,754
Anees?

1027
00:56:23,812 --> 00:56:25,723
Anees Ismail? That dangerous don.

1028
00:56:25,781 --> 00:56:27,556
He's planning to catch him.

1029
00:56:27,616 --> 00:56:29,220
Then I would like
to meet him right now.

1030
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:30,059
What?
- Yes.

1031
00:56:38,427 --> 00:56:39,462
You're laughing.

1032
00:56:39,528 --> 00:56:41,405
The commissioner's waiting
for you downstairsâ

1033
00:56:43,866 --> 00:56:45,539
Mom, you got fooled too.

1034
00:56:45,601 --> 00:56:46,705
You're so innocent.

1035
00:56:47,269 --> 00:56:48,805
He's no police commissioner.

1036
00:56:49,238 --> 00:56:50,512
He's not the commissioner.

1037
00:56:50,906 --> 00:56:53,409
He's an actor.
- Actor?

1038
00:56:53,475 --> 00:56:56,081
He used to work as a
commissioner in TV serials.

1039
00:56:56,478 --> 00:56:58,651
One day he suddenly
stopped getting work..

1040
00:56:58,714 --> 00:56:59,818
âAnd lost his mind.

1041
00:57:00,282 --> 00:57:01,784
Then?
- He went mad.

1042
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,191
He dons the police uniform
and sets out on the road.

1043
00:57:05,254 --> 00:57:07,598
He goes and sits in any
police station that he sees.

1044
00:57:07,656 --> 00:57:10,535
Oh Lord!
- Lord, have mercy on him.

1045
00:57:10,893 --> 00:57:13,430
And he's been kept here
for treatment. - I see.

1046
00:57:13,495 --> 00:57:17,341
And those people around him,
in uniform, are crazy. - What?

1047
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:18,838
I mean they're actors.

1048
00:57:19,134 --> 00:57:21,341
They're acting so that
he feels he's the commissioner.

1049
00:57:21,403 --> 00:57:23,110
But why?
- Because the doctor's saidâ

1050
00:57:23,172 --> 00:57:24,651
...this is the only way to treat him.

1051
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:29,679
And the doctor's also said
keep his illusion intact. - Why?

1052
00:57:29,745 --> 00:57:33,557
Because if his illusion shatters,
then he can lose his life.

1053
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,687
Heart-fail.

1054
00:57:37,586 --> 00:57:38,428
Sonâ

1055
00:57:39,188 --> 00:57:41,361
Son, we won't shatter
his illusion either.

1056
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:43,269
You've got to act
in front of him as well.

1057
00:57:43,325 --> 00:57:46,704
Mom. You know I can't act.

1058
00:57:47,129 --> 00:57:50,167
Try.
- Okay, mom. I will.

1059
00:57:50,432 --> 00:57:51,308
Only for you.

1060
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:58,809
My mom'sâ

1061
00:58:00,342 --> 00:58:01,184
What?

1062
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,386
That's why I..

1063
00:58:06,715 --> 00:58:08,752
Look, first speak then cry.

1064
00:58:08,817 --> 00:58:10,421
Or first cry then speak.

1065
00:58:10,486 --> 00:58:11,829
Don't speak and cry together,
Inspector.

1066
00:58:12,187 --> 00:58:14,258
I am not an inspector.
- What?

1067
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:17,097
And this uniform?
- It's rented.

1068
00:58:17,459 --> 00:58:19,803
I've worn it to keep my mother alive.

1069
00:58:20,462 --> 00:58:23,306
What's this story?
- It's a sad story.

1070
00:58:30,105 --> 00:58:32,517
My mother loved watching films.

1071
00:58:32,875 --> 00:58:34,650
One day she went to watch a film.

1072
00:58:35,277 --> 00:58:38,315
The story of an honest
officer and his mother.

1073
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:41,452
Suddenly, the fan above
fell on my mother's head.

1074
00:58:41,517 --> 00:58:43,053
Oh, my God! Then what?

1075
00:58:43,352 --> 00:58:45,855
The fan stopped,
but my mother lost her mind.

1076
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:48,362
Oh no.
- Oh yes.

1077
00:58:49,191 --> 00:58:51,535
Since then she thinks
I'm a police officer.

1078
00:58:51,593 --> 00:58:53,834
And I wear this uniform
in front of her.

1079
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:56,268
But what do the doctors say?

1080
00:58:56,598 --> 00:58:59,238
They say this is the
only way to treat her.

1081
00:58:59,635 --> 00:59:02,775
Keep her illusion intact.
- Why?

1082
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:04,715
Because if I take off my uniform..

1083
00:59:05,107 --> 00:59:07,053
...then my mother will lose her life.

1084
00:59:08,644 --> 00:59:10,055
No, no. Keep this uniform on.

1085
00:59:10,779 --> 00:59:12,725
We'll keep your mother's
illusion intact, Vishwas.

1086
00:59:14,616 --> 00:59:16,425
Inspector Vishwas.

1087
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:25,632
Mr. Commissioner, she's my mother.

1088
00:59:25,694 --> 00:59:26,638
Yes, we've met before.

1089
00:59:26,695 --> 00:59:28,436
Mom, he's the Commissioner.

1090
00:59:29,298 --> 00:59:31,141
My son really praises you.

1091
00:59:31,433 --> 00:59:33,811
He says you're a big televisionâ
- Mom..

1092
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:34,808
Television?

1093
00:59:35,571 --> 00:59:37,812
I mean, there's no other police
officer like you in this city.

1094
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:39,245
Yes.

1095
00:59:39,308 --> 00:59:42,585
And I say, your son acts so wellâ

1096
00:59:42,644 --> 00:59:43,588
Sir..

1097
00:59:43,645 --> 00:59:47,559
Act?
- I meant active.

1098
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:51,198
He's the most active inspector
in our entire department.

1099
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:52,824
Right, Vishwas?

1100
00:59:53,322 --> 00:59:54,801
Inspector Vishwas.

1101
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:57,497
Mr. Commissioner,
do look after yourself.

1102
00:59:57,559 --> 01:00:00,096
You shouldn't go out on the
streets wearing this uniform.. - Mom.

1103
01:00:00,462 --> 01:00:01,372
Alone on the streets?

1104
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:04,640
I mean, you should keep
your constables with you. - Yes.

1105
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:07,375
And you should watch fewer films.
- Sir.

1106
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:10,407
I don't watch films.

1107
01:00:11,173 --> 01:00:14,211
I do. I watch lots of films.

1108
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:17,322
Just a minute, madam.
Just come with me. - Yes.

1109
01:00:20,616 --> 01:00:22,425
Vishwas, what is she saying?

1110
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,857
Television serial?
Don't roam the streets? I'm confused.

1111
01:00:25,921 --> 01:00:29,664
There's no confusion. It's simple.

1112
01:00:30,192 --> 01:00:32,297
Really? - You're not
the joint commissioner.

1113
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:34,102
What?
- For my mother.

1114
01:00:34,763 --> 01:00:37,835
But you are, for me.
- Thank God.

1115
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,881
I'm a police inspector.
- But you said you're not.

1116
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,672
For my mom, sir.

1117
01:00:42,738 --> 01:00:44,718
But I'm not, for you.

1118
01:00:45,674 --> 01:00:48,917
Andâ
- I get it. I understand.

1119
01:00:49,478 --> 01:00:52,357
I'm the joint commissioner,
but I am not.

1120
01:00:52,681 --> 01:00:53,785
In your mom's view.

1121
01:00:54,249 --> 01:00:57,458
And you're not a police inspector,
but you are one.

1122
01:00:57,519 --> 01:00:58,793
In your mom's view.

1123
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:00,358
And mother's a mother after all.

1124
01:01:01,123 --> 01:01:03,069
But she isn't, in whose view?

1125
01:01:03,325 --> 01:01:04,861
A mother's always a mother,
in everyone's view.

1126
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:06,702
Sir, you're soâ
- Yes.

1127
01:01:07,129 --> 01:01:08,403
A mother's always a mother.

1128
01:01:13,435 --> 01:01:15,745
There are bigger malls in Mumbai.

1129
01:01:15,804 --> 01:01:17,784
Hello, sir. I was looking for you.

1130
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,242
Sir.

1131
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:20,150
Hello.

1132
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:22,454
Who is she?

1133
01:01:22,511 --> 01:01:23,615
She's my mother.
- What?

1134
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:25,454
Sorry. Are you my mother?

1135
01:01:25,714 --> 01:01:26,692
Vishwas.

1136
01:01:28,684 --> 01:01:31,358
She's my mother.
- Aunt.

1137
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:33,094
Bless you, dear.

1138
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:35,332
Who is she?
- She's a girl.

1139
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:37,597
I know that, but who is she?

1140
01:01:38,293 --> 01:01:40,364
She's a girl, andâ
- Kajal.

1141
01:01:40,429 --> 01:01:42,431
She's Kajal, mom.

1142
01:01:42,931 --> 01:01:46,105
Whenever anything
bad occurs in the city..

1143
01:01:46,368 --> 01:01:47,574
...you will find her there.

1144
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,872
What?
- Aunt, let me tell you.

1145
01:01:50,272 --> 01:01:51,580
I'm a social worker.

1146
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,551
Whenever I see anything
wrong happening in the city..

1147
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:57,216
...I inform the police.
- Great. You do the right thing.

1148
01:01:57,279 --> 01:01:59,816
And I'm here with a complaint
right now, aunt. For him.

1149
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,624
Sir, Paradise club at Gol Chowki..

1150
01:02:02,684 --> 01:02:05,460
âDeal in every kind
of illegal drugs and business.

1151
01:02:05,821 --> 01:02:06,822
I just found out thatâ

1152
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,495
âsome juvenile girls
are being held captive there.

1153
01:02:09,558 --> 01:02:10,866
Oh God!
- Yes. Let's go.

1154
01:02:11,159 --> 01:02:13,400
Let's go lodge a complaint
with the police. - What?

1155
01:02:13,462 --> 01:02:14,805
I'm the police.

1156
01:02:15,297 --> 01:02:16,332
I'm the police.

1157
01:02:16,398 --> 01:02:19,436
But that isn't my area, Kajal.

1158
01:02:19,501 --> 01:02:21,412
So, go lodge a complaint
with the area's inspector.

1159
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:23,472
Go fast. I did go there.
- You did.

1160
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:25,485
But inspector Ghorpade
isn't ready to listen.

1161
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:27,418
He isn't?
- No. - Forget the area.

1162
01:02:27,476 --> 01:02:29,456
Go, go with her.
And free those girls. Go.

1163
01:02:29,511 --> 01:02:30,888
I can't go, mom.

1164
01:02:31,179 --> 01:02:32,249
L..
- Hold this.

1165
01:02:32,781 --> 01:02:34,260
Dear, which way?
- Aunt.

1166

At Gol Chowki, there's a..
- Quiet.

Hold this, mom.

Let's go, mom. Come, Kajal.
- Come.

1169
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:45,830
100 million in cash.

1170
01:02:46,428 --> 01:02:48,271
Anything special?
- It's very special.

1171
01:02:48,697 --> 01:02:51,268
All this money is for
'Mission White Elephant'.

1172
01:02:52,267 --> 01:02:55,441
Remember.
Gundappa sir has said, ""Be careful"".

1173
01:02:55,804 --> 01:02:56,874
Don't worry.

1174
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,543
This is one of Gundappa
sir's safest places.

1175
01:02:58,607 --> 01:03:00,314
No one can come here.
- Good.

1176
01:03:00,375 --> 01:03:01,649
Let us go!

1177
01:03:07,115 --> 01:03:08,219
What a club!

1178
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:10,796
Till now I only saw them in films.

1179
01:03:12,654 --> 01:03:14,395
It's the Abode of Gods!

1180
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:18,303
Rambha. Menka.
Urvashi. They're all here.

1181
01:03:19,828 --> 01:03:24,106
They are not girls,
they're vanilla ice-cream.

1182
01:03:26,134 --> 01:03:29,343
Sir. What are you staring at?

1183
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:32,484
I wasn't staring. I was thinking,
girls like you shouldn't go lo a..

1184
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:35,454
...club like this to see such
cheap dance.

1185
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:36,716
We should leave right now.

1186
01:03:36,778 --> 01:03:38,519
Sir, we're not hereto see the dance.

1187
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:39,854
We're hereto free the girls.

1188
01:03:40,148 --> 01:03:42,628
Inspector!
- Don't you know thatâ

1189
01:03:42,684 --> 01:03:44,163
âthe police are not
allowed in this club?

1190
01:03:44,486 --> 01:03:45,829
So what are you doing here?

1191
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:50,497
Just taking a stroll around.
Just like that.

1192
01:03:50,792 --> 01:03:52,635
It's nice.
- No, it's not.

1193

We're hereto conduct a raid.

1194
01:03:53,929 --> 01:03:55,636
I'm a reporter.
And I've information thatâ

01:03:55,697 --> 01:03:57,802
...you've held some girls captive here.

1196

Bring them out.
- Hey, girl. What nonsense.

1197
01:04:00,702 --> 01:04:01,840
Calm down, Kajal. Calm down.

1198
01:04:02,137 --> 01:04:04,139
Sir. Are you scared of fighting?

1199
01:04:04,206 --> 01:04:06,447
No, I'm not scared. I enjoy fighting.

1200
01:04:07,309 --> 01:04:08,447
You see, Kajal.

1201
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:11,855
If they injure my face
my career will be over forever.

1202
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:13,189
What?

1203
01:04:13,248 --> 01:04:15,319
Let me talk to them.
- You will talk to us?

1204
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:16,590
You will talk to us?

Why call so many people to talk?

1209

This is how we talk here.

We're hereto teach you a lesson.

This inspector is a
bulldozer without brakes.

Once he starts he doesn't stop.

1215
01:04:40,575 --> 01:04:42,248
I see.
- Move aside.

1216
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:43,288
Shoot him!

Come on, get out quickly. Run away!

1230
01:06:27,482 --> 01:06:29,120
Money.

1231
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:37,435
What's going on here?

1232
01:06:40,295 --> 01:06:41,603
Let's go.

1233
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:45,173
Attention!

1234
01:06:45,233 --> 01:06:47,270
Officer, attentionâ

1235
01:06:47,335 --> 01:06:49,281
Ghorpade, we called you long ago.

1236
01:06:49,337 --> 01:06:50,782
Ghorpade sir, this isn't right.

1237
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:52,341
Why did you take so long to come here?

1238
01:06:52,407 --> 01:06:53,385
You have again sent the
same inspector.

1239
01:06:53,675 --> 01:06:55,882
No, I meanâ Move on.

1240
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:00,390
Breaking news.

1241
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:03,459
Police conduct a raid
at Gundappa Das' Paradise club.

1242
01:07:03,518 --> 01:07:06,590
On the orders of Gol
Chowki police station'sâ

1243
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:08,100
âsenior inspector Ghorpadeâ

1244
01:07:08,156 --> 01:07:09,658
...one of his young officers,
didn't just thrash the goons..

1245
01:07:09,724 --> 01:07:11,670
âBut also rescued
some juvenile girls.

1246
01:07:11,726 --> 01:07:13,831
And confiscated millions of rupees.

1247
01:07:14,262 --> 01:07:16,333
Ghorpade sir,
what would you like to say?

1248
01:07:16,598 --> 01:07:17,474
Me?

1249
01:07:17,799 --> 01:07:18,777
I am sorry, sir.

1250
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:20,443
What do I say?

1251
01:07:20,502 --> 01:07:22,448
I don't know who did it.

1252
01:07:22,504 --> 01:07:24,415
I just arrived recently.

1253
01:07:24,439 --> 01:07:25,747
How much is this?

1254
01:07:25,774 --> 01:07:26,775
Who told you?

1255
01:07:30,512 --> 01:07:31,855
Kajal, what are you doing?

1256
01:07:31,913 --> 01:07:33,392
What if it starts raining?

1257
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:35,787
The doctor's asked
you to keep the wound dry.

1258
01:07:36,251 --> 01:07:37,252
It feels nice.

1259
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:39,799
Of course, all the girls were rescued.

1260
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:41,334
Except for one.
- What?

1261
01:07:41,623 --> 01:07:43,500
No, they all ran away.

1262
01:07:43,558 --> 01:07:44,593
I saw it myself.

1263
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,733
Why are you laughing?
- Just like that.

1264
01:07:47,796 --> 01:07:49,673
Only crazy people
laugh without a reason.

1265
01:07:52,467 --> 01:07:54,310
I can't see a rickshaw around either.

1266
01:07:54,369 --> 01:07:56,246
If it starts raining,
we'll be in trouble.

1267
01:07:56,771 --> 01:07:58,773
That'll be even better.

1268
01:07:59,941 --> 01:08:02,387
I don't know,
but everything seems nice.

1269
01:08:02,744 --> 01:08:04,587
I'm injured, but even that feels nice.

1270
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:08,626
Madam. Did you hit your head?

1271
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:11,330
Have you lost your mind?

1272
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:18,797
I grew up alone.

1273
01:08:21,329 --> 01:08:25,141
I was very young, when my parentsâ

1274
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:33,651
And, I neverâ

1275
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:37,756
âhad a kin.

1276
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:41,761
Today, for the first timeâ

1277
01:08:44,853 --> 01:08:49,802
It felt like...I've a kin.

1278
01:08:57,465 --> 01:09:00,173
""You're the dream.""

1279
01:09:00,235 --> 01:09:02,476
""I'm the slumber.""

1280
01:09:02,737 --> 01:09:08,278
""Together we make up the night.""
- I am always with you.

1281
01:09:08,343 --> 01:09:13,343
""Every day I praymlhal
our wishes are fulfilled.""

1282
01:09:19,154 --> 01:09:22,260
""Our wishes are fulfilled.""

1283
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:32,540
""I'm the colour of syrups.""

1284
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,773
""And you're the sweet of river.""

01:09:35,236 --> 01:09:37,648
""I'm the colour of syrups.""

""Slowly, calmly,
I've woven your dreams logetheru""

1293
01:10:06,267 --> 01:10:10,511
""..with my slumber.""

1294
01:10:11,306 --> 01:10:16,221
""I don't want the earth,
or the heaven.""

1295
01:10:16,511 --> 01:10:20,618
""All I want is you in my life.""

1296
01:10:21,282 --> 01:10:23,785
""You're the saga of love.""

1297
01:10:23,852 --> 01:10:26,264
""And I'm naively.""

1298
01:10:26,321 --> 01:10:31,634
""Togethermwe can make up our story.""

1299
01:10:31,693 --> 01:10:33,832

""Your thoughts are the
only place I want to be.""

01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:07,264
""You mean everything to me,
always did.""

1305
01:11:07,328 --> 01:11:11,674
""The rest of the world

""YIN-I'm a traveller ""

1307

""And you're the sweet of river.""

1317

The cash that I sent
for 'Mission White Elephant'..

01:11:50,371 --> 01:11:51,577
âWas confiscated.

1319
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,647
Why?
- Yes, sir.

1320
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:56,382
There's a police inspectorâ

1321
01:11:56,744 --> 01:12:01,625
âwho, for no reason...always..

1322

Sir, I've seen that inspector.

Andmsoon I'll find him.

1324
01:12:09,657 --> 01:12:10,727
Finish him.

1325
01:12:11,626 --> 01:12:12,798
And be careful.

1326
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:17,838
RAW and Interpol are keeping
an eye on our movements.

1327
01:12:17,899 --> 01:12:18,877
Look.

1328
01:12:19,934 --> 01:12:22,312
We won't discuss this any further.

1329
01:12:23,338 --> 01:12:25,113
I'm sending you the entire
information of this mission..

1330
01:12:25,473 --> 01:12:27,749
âThrough an agent, on a CD.

1331
01:12:28,276 --> 01:12:30,381
And make no mistakes.

1332
01:12:31,746 --> 01:12:33,225
I'm arriving next week.

1333
01:12:33,715 --> 01:12:35,092
Okay?

1334
01:12:35,283 --> 01:12:37,661
I have left for the station.

1335
01:12:39,587 --> 01:12:42,090
What's this crowd for?
- Don't know, madam.

1336
01:12:43,191 --> 01:12:44,431
I will miss my train.

1337
01:12:44,492 --> 01:12:47,302
Hire another rickshaw.
- Okay.

1338
01:12:49,764 --> 01:12:52,370
What is my mistake... let me go.

1339
01:12:52,433 --> 01:12:53,673
Let me go.

1340
01:12:53,968 --> 01:12:56,312
Don't beat me. Someone help me.
- You lodge complaint.

1341
01:12:56,371 --> 01:12:57,907
Come with me.
- Leave me. Let me go.

1342
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,379
What is my mistake... don't beat me.

1343
01:13:04,512 --> 01:13:05,547
Leave me.

1344
01:13:08,116 --> 01:13:09,254
Someone help me.
- You lodge complaints.

1345
01:13:09,317 --> 01:13:09,727
Come to the police station.

1346
01:13:09,784 --> 01:13:11,661
Someone help me.
- Leave her.

1347
01:13:13,121 --> 01:13:16,125
Mom.. - Don't call me mom.
Don't call me mom.

1348
01:13:16,491 --> 01:13:20,166
You've humiliated your mother,
not just this uniform.

1349
01:13:20,228 --> 01:13:21,673
Why didn't you just die.

1350
01:13:21,729 --> 01:13:23,504
Why didn't you die?

1351
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:25,841
What's going on?
Get her out! Get her out!

1352
01:13:27,202 --> 01:13:28,545
She's my mom.

1353
01:13:28,603 --> 01:13:29,741
There is shooting going on here.

1354
01:13:30,138 --> 01:13:31,583
There is shooting going on here.

1355
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:36,611
Listen to me, mom.

1356
01:13:40,515 --> 01:13:42,324
Drive away this madwoman from here.

1357
01:13:56,531 --> 01:13:57,407
Move from here.

1358
01:13:57,732 --> 01:13:59,769
Don't touch my mother.
Don't touch my mother.

1359
01:14:00,168 --> 01:14:03,638
Listen to me, mom. Mom..

1360
01:14:07,842 --> 01:14:10,413
Mom..

1361
01:14:14,582 --> 01:14:16,584
Mom!

1362
01:14:17,218 --> 01:14:18,697
Someone get me a rickshaw.

1363
01:14:18,753 --> 01:14:19,823
Someone get me a taxi.

1364
01:14:19,887 --> 01:14:21,798
Someone get me a rickshaw.

1365
01:14:56,829 --> 01:14:58,240
How's mom?

1366
01:15:02,335 --> 01:15:03,643
Don't know.

1367
01:15:23,356 --> 01:15:25,336
I'm not a police inspector, Kajal.

1368
01:15:25,725 --> 01:15:27,033
I was only lying.

1369
01:15:30,496 --> 01:15:32,203
I lied to mom as well.

1370
01:15:33,733 --> 01:15:34,677
That's why sheâ

1371
01:15:36,436 --> 01:15:38,006
Mom will be fine, Vishwaâ

1372
01:15:45,311 --> 01:15:50,989
""I know...I'm lonely.""

1373
01:15:51,584 --> 01:15:57,125
""How can I live...if you leave me?""

1374
01:15:57,690 --> 01:16:03,299
""Don't stay silent, say something.""

1375
01:16:04,063 --> 01:16:09,376
""You can scold me if you like.""

1376
01:16:10,136 --> 01:16:16,985
""You can scold me if you like.""

1377
01:16:29,322 --> 01:16:31,165
Will you do as I say, son?

1378
01:16:31,457 --> 01:16:34,666
Of course, mom. I will.

1379
01:16:37,263 --> 01:16:39,106
Will you deceive me again?

1380
01:16:41,267 --> 01:16:42,302
No, mom.

1381
01:16:43,402 --> 01:16:45,177
Never again.

1382
01:16:45,671 --> 01:16:47,150
Forgive me.

1383
01:16:48,608 --> 01:16:50,087
What do you want?

1384
01:16:52,011 --> 01:16:56,016
Get me...some poison.

1385
01:16:57,717 --> 01:17:00,129
I don't want to live.

1386
01:17:00,586 --> 01:17:02,327
Don't say that.

1387
01:17:02,388 --> 01:17:03,662
Don't say that, mom.

1388
01:17:05,191 --> 01:17:07,068
I'll never do anything wrong again.

1389
01:17:07,126 --> 01:17:08,605
Never again.

1390
01:17:10,696 --> 01:17:13,074
You acted so well.

1391
01:17:16,169 --> 01:17:20,174
Even...your mother
couldn't recognise you.

1392
01:17:23,709 --> 01:17:25,655
You'll be a good actor.

1393
01:17:30,616 --> 01:17:32,061
No, mom.

1394
01:17:32,718 --> 01:17:34,391
I don't want to be an actor.

1395
01:17:36,255 --> 01:17:38,292
I want to be a police officer.

1396
01:17:38,558 --> 01:17:41,095
An honest police officer.
I don't want to be an actor.

1397
01:17:42,061 --> 01:17:43,540
What are you doing inside?

1398
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:46,307
Please go out, it's not allowed.

1399
01:17:47,466 --> 01:17:49,104
Look, her condition's critical.

1400
01:17:49,168 --> 01:17:50,670
She needs complete rest.

1401
01:17:51,103 --> 01:17:53,947
Doctor, will my mother be okay?
- We can't say right now.

1402
01:17:54,373 --> 01:17:55,374
Please leave.

1403
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:02,184
Your mother will be fine, Vishwas.

1404
01:18:04,016 --> 01:18:05,495
She's just shocked.

1405
01:18:07,587 --> 01:18:09,328
Because her dreams were shattered.

1406
01:18:10,690 --> 01:18:12,101
When you were one year old..

1407
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,699
Your father was a cruel officer.

1408
01:18:17,363 --> 01:18:19,274
He would take money from the rich..

1409
01:18:19,732 --> 01:18:21,734
âAnd do their dirty jobs for them.

1410
01:18:22,335 --> 01:18:24,576
'Savitri. Don't interfere.'

1411
01:18:24,637 --> 01:18:25,707
'She's a decent girl, let her..'

1412
01:18:25,771 --> 01:18:29,116
'I want to teach a lesson
to this decent girl's father.'

1413
01:18:29,175 --> 01:18:32,213
'That girl's father,
Shashtri owned a factoryu'

1414
01:18:32,278 --> 01:18:34,656
'..which was the only means
of earning for the villagers.'

1415
01:18:34,714 --> 01:18:36,751
'The rich men wanted that land.'

1416
01:18:36,816 --> 01:18:39,729
No, inspector.
Don't do that. I will sign.

1417
01:18:39,785 --> 01:18:42,129
'Helpless Shashtri
signed on the papers.'

1418
01:18:42,788 --> 01:18:46,702
'The same night both father
and daughter committed suicide.'

1419
01:18:46,759 --> 01:18:51,139
'People were furious,
they set out to kill your father.'

1420
01:18:51,197 --> 01:18:53,575
'I've told you before,
slop these illegal deeds.'

1421
01:18:53,633 --> 01:18:55,203
'The curse of these poor people..'

1422
01:18:55,268 --> 01:18:56,440
""..will never let us live happily.'

1423
01:18:56,502 --> 01:18:58,482
'If anything happens to you..'

1424
01:18:58,537 --> 01:19:01,609
'The same old thing.
The same old lecture.'

1425
01:19:02,008 --> 01:19:04,545
'I made a big mistake marrying you.'

1426
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:07,250
'I admit your father
was an honest policeman.'

1427
01:19:07,313 --> 01:19:09,657
'But how did he die? A pauper.'

1428
01:19:09,715 --> 01:19:12,525
'I don't want to die like that,
Savitri.'

1429
01:19:12,585 --> 01:19:14,223
'Everyone has to die one day.'

1430
01:19:14,287 --> 01:19:15,527
'Everyone does.'

1431
01:19:15,588 --> 01:19:18,194
'But the question
is how does one live.'

1432
01:19:18,257 --> 01:19:20,237
'If you want to live
then come with me.'

1433
01:19:20,526 --> 01:19:22,005
'They cam.'

1434
01:19:26,832 --> 01:19:27,776
Listen.

1435
01:19:57,596 --> 01:20:01,510
There are his wife and kid.
Finish them!

1436
01:20:02,301 --> 01:20:03,541
Stop!

1437
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:06,677
No one will lay a finger on them.

1438
01:20:07,039 --> 01:20:08,609
I will break your heads.

1439
01:20:08,674 --> 01:20:10,517
You will save them!

1440
01:20:10,576 --> 01:20:13,284
Our curse will finish
Yashwanl Rae's family.

1441
01:20:14,013 --> 01:20:14,753
We won't spare them either.

1442
01:20:14,814 --> 01:20:17,556
We left the village.
- Both mother and son will suffer.

1443
01:20:17,616 --> 01:20:19,357
And your mother sworeâ

1444
01:20:20,086 --> 01:20:22,464
...that she will repent
for your father's crimes.

1445
01:20:23,289 --> 01:20:25,326
By making you an
honest police officer.

1446
01:20:26,325 --> 01:20:29,033
And people will sing
praises of your honesty.

1447
01:20:29,562 --> 01:20:32,441
It will restore people's trust
on policemen.

1448
01:20:33,165 --> 01:20:36,044
That's why I named you
Vishwas (Trust).

1449
01:20:48,214 --> 01:20:49,284
Mr. Vishwas.

1450
01:20:52,284 --> 01:20:54,161
Dr. Vinod Khanna's calling you.

1451
01:20:57,323 --> 01:20:58,666
Vinod Khanna's turned a doctor?

1452
01:20:59,058 --> 01:21:01,163
What? But he's always been a doctor.

1453
01:21:01,227 --> 01:21:02,570
Come.
- I see.

1454
01:21:03,596 --> 01:21:05,633
So, he was acting
in films just like that.

1455
01:21:05,698 --> 01:21:07,507
Stop thinking about films, Vishwas.

1456
01:21:07,566 --> 01:21:09,409
Vinod Khanna can be
someone else's name too.

1457
01:21:10,403 --> 01:21:11,381
Come on.

1458
01:21:11,704 --> 01:21:13,581
Your mother's in a bad condition.

1459
01:21:14,173 --> 01:21:15,345
We'll have to perform surgery.

1460
01:21:15,775 --> 01:21:17,277
It'll cost around one million.

1461
01:21:20,713 --> 01:21:21,657
One million?

1462
01:21:22,214 --> 01:21:23,750
Deposit the money soon.

1463
01:21:24,216 --> 01:21:25,194
We don't have much time.

1464
01:21:28,354 --> 01:21:30,197
Start preparing for
the surgery, Doctor.

1465
01:21:30,556 --> 01:21:33,298
I'll get the money.

1466
01:21:34,326 --> 01:21:35,066
Somehow.

1467
01:21:46,038 --> 01:21:47,483
You are under arrest.

1468
01:21:47,773 --> 01:21:49,309
For posing as a cop.

1469
01:21:50,509 --> 01:21:52,511
My mother's very ill.

1470
01:21:53,546 --> 01:21:55,617
I've to arrange for
one million for her surgery.

1471
01:21:56,215 --> 01:21:57,319
I am sorry!

1472
01:21:58,284 --> 01:21:59,456
Come with us.

1473
01:22:02,288 --> 01:22:03,289
Come.

1474
01:22:04,089 --> 01:22:06,296
Tell me, sir.
Where are you taking me to?

1475
01:22:06,358 --> 01:22:07,359
To us.

1476
01:22:07,426 --> 01:22:08,632
Who said that?

1477
01:22:09,595 --> 01:22:12,508
L...am Gundappa Das.

1478
01:22:14,266 --> 01:22:15,506
But why bring me here?

1479
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:19,381
You need rupees one million.

1480
01:22:19,772 --> 01:22:21,115
We'll help you.

1481
01:22:22,074 --> 01:22:22,677
Why?

1482
01:22:23,242 --> 01:22:24,448
Why will you give me the money?

1483
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:26,956
Because you will do a job for us.

1484
01:22:27,213 --> 01:22:29,523
Look. I won't do anything wrong.

1485
01:22:33,686 --> 01:22:37,498
No one pays one million
for doing anything good, son.

1486
01:22:42,695 --> 01:22:44,470
Hello.
- Dr. Khanna, here.

1487
01:22:44,530 --> 01:22:47,067
Your mother's condition
is getting critical.

1488
01:22:49,001 --> 01:22:50,674
And you haven't paid the money yet.

1489
01:22:51,203 --> 01:22:52,648
No, sir. I'm trying, sir.

1490
01:22:53,072 --> 01:22:55,018
Please understand
and do something fast.

1491
01:22:55,074 --> 01:22:56,917
I'm trying.

1492
01:23:01,647 --> 01:23:03,149
I want rupees one million.

1493
01:23:03,582 --> 01:23:04,526
Tell me the job.

1494
01:23:05,084 --> 01:23:07,462
A cultural dance troupeâ

1495
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:08,726
âhas arrived in
Mumbai from Hong Kong.

1496
01:23:09,388 --> 01:23:12,369
Our agent has sent a CD through them.

1497
01:23:13,125 --> 01:23:14,195
They're performing a show today.

1498
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:17,573
You'll go up on the
stage during the showâ

1499
01:23:17,630 --> 01:23:19,473
âcollect the CD and bring it here.

1500
01:23:19,732 --> 01:23:21,734
But any of your henchmen
can do this job.

1501
01:23:23,235 --> 01:23:24,737
The security there is tight.

1502
01:23:25,271 --> 01:23:28,013
And it's impossible
for any stranger to get in.

1503
01:23:28,741 --> 01:23:30,152
Then how will I get in?

1504
01:23:30,809 --> 01:23:34,518
The chief security officer
for the show is Bhimsingh Thappa.

1505
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:37,424
And we had kidnapped his girl..

1506
01:23:37,483 --> 01:23:40,555
âAnd you rescued her on Link Road.

1507
01:23:42,087 --> 01:23:43,191
'I am Suman Thappa..'

1508
01:23:43,255 --> 01:23:45,531
'..chief security officer
Bhimsingh Thappa's daughter.'

1509
01:23:46,559 --> 01:23:48,698
Both, father and daughter think..

1510
01:23:48,994 --> 01:23:51,099
...you're an honest police officer.

1511
01:23:52,698 --> 01:23:57,010
So with their help,
you can easily get on stage.

1512
01:24:08,781 --> 01:24:11,728
""I'm the bird that
soars in the skies.""

1513
01:24:11,784 --> 01:24:14,731
""Belovedmyou are the
fruit that dangles on earth.""

1514

1515
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:20,600
""Belovedmyou are the

1516
01:24:20,659 --> 01:24:21,467
""But.""

1517
01:24:21,527 --> 01:24:24,474
""The heart's...definitely crazy.""

1518
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:27,170
""It jumps up and down.""

1519
01:24:27,533 --> 01:24:30,309
""But it's always in the best mood.""

1520
01:24:30,369 --> 01:24:32,349
""One, two, three, four, five..""

1521

""My heart's like magnet.""

01:24:56,095 --> 01:24:57,438
""My heart's like magnet.""

1529
01:24:57,496 --> 01:24:58,634
""My heart.""

1530
01:24:58,697 --> 01:25:00,438
""My heart's like the magnet.""

1531
01:25:00,499 --> 01:25:03,139
""I've cancelled all others.""

1532
01:25:03,202 --> 01:25:05,113
""You're my true lover.""

1533
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:06,547
""You're my true lover.""

1534
01:25:06,605 --> 01:25:07,606
""MY lover. ""

1535
01:25:07,673 --> 01:25:09,209
""You're my true lover.""

1536
01:25:09,274 --> 01:25:12,744
""Pleased in a moment,

1537
01:25:12,811 --> 01:25:14,381
""My heart's technicolor.""

1538
01:25:14,446 --> 01:25:15,754
""Changes in a moment.""

1539
01:25:15,814 --> 01:25:18,761
""But it's always in the best mood.""

1540
01:25:18,817 --> 01:25:22,264
""It always counts one,
two, three, four, five..""

1541
01:25:22,321 --> 01:25:23,163

- Stop. Vishwas.

1556
01:26:16,208 --> 01:26:17,448
Catch him, Ghorpade.

1557
01:27:16,535 --> 01:27:17,479
Vishwasl

1558
01:27:17,536 --> 01:27:19,174
Vishwasl What have you done?

1559
01:27:19,438 --> 01:27:20,974
You killed two policemen.

1560
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:23,117
Give me the gun.

1561
01:27:24,476 --> 01:27:25,750
You were supposed to
keep the police engrossed.

1562
01:27:26,278 --> 01:27:27,279
How did they come here?

1563
01:27:27,346 --> 01:27:28,518
I don't know.

1564
01:27:28,781 --> 01:27:31,352
Come to your senses, Vishwas.

1565
01:27:31,416 --> 01:27:33,191
The car's here. Run.

1566
01:27:33,252 --> 01:27:35,129
<i>Ru-M</i>

1567
01:27:37,623 --> 01:27:39,261
Vishwas killed two policemen, sir.

1568
01:27:39,324 --> 01:27:40,200
What?

1569
01:27:42,261 --> 01:27:44,263
That's good, Ghorpade.

1570
01:27:44,329 --> 01:27:46,502
Now Vishwas has no other optionâ

1571
01:27:46,565 --> 01:27:49,205
âand we've a new
lifetime gang-member.

1572
01:27:51,036 --> 01:27:51,741
Yesâ

1573
01:28:00,078 --> 01:28:00,715
Kajal.

1574
01:28:01,213 --> 01:28:02,658
Yes, Kajal. How's mom?

1575
01:28:03,081 --> 01:28:04,492
Mom's not in the hospital, Vishwas.

1576
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:06,028
She's not in the hospital?

1577
01:28:06,318 --> 01:28:08,764
We looked everywhere,
but can't find her.

1578
01:28:16,295 --> 01:28:19,071
Very good. Very good.

1579
01:28:19,131 --> 01:28:20,667
Boys...
- Where's my mom?

1580
01:28:21,834 --> 01:28:22,710
Mom!

1581
01:28:24,636 --> 01:28:26,115
She's right here.

1582
01:28:27,573 --> 01:28:29,678
And she's perfectly alright.

1583
01:28:31,677 --> 01:28:33,179
Don't worry.

1584
01:28:33,245 --> 01:28:34,349
She's absolutely fine.

1585
01:28:34,413 --> 01:28:36,359
She didn't need any surgery.

1586
01:28:37,349 --> 01:28:38,623
She only had blood pressureâ

1587
01:28:38,684 --> 01:28:40,254
âand we controlled
it with medication.

1588
01:28:41,987 --> 01:28:43,364
So, why did you lie to me?

1589
01:28:43,622 --> 01:28:44,623
I told him to.

1590
01:28:46,191 --> 01:28:49,400
Because I wanted you to do this job.

1591
01:28:50,495 --> 01:28:52,600
This is our gang-doctor.

1592
01:28:54,032 --> 01:28:57,070
Just like a family doctor
is called family doctorâ

1593
01:28:57,603 --> 01:28:59,640
âsimilarly, I am his gang's doctor.

1594
01:29:01,039 --> 01:29:02,541
What's this nonsense?

1595
01:29:04,142 --> 01:29:06,122
Your lie ruined my entire life.

1596
01:29:06,511 --> 01:29:08,650
I killed two policemen today,
and you..

1597
01:29:08,714 --> 01:29:11,194
Calm down, sonny. Calm down.

1598
01:29:12,084 --> 01:29:13,995
You asked me for a million
rupees for surgery..

1599
01:29:14,386 --> 01:29:15,763
...which I am giving you.

1600
01:29:19,358 --> 01:29:20,735
To heck with your money.

1601
01:29:21,293 --> 01:29:22,237
Where's my mom?

1602
01:29:23,228 --> 01:29:24,298
She's in that room.

1603
01:29:26,431 --> 01:29:27,774
She's angry with you.

1604
01:29:30,068 --> 01:29:32,309
You killed two policemen.

1605
01:29:35,574 --> 01:29:36,780
I had to tell her.

1606
01:29:51,056 --> 01:29:51,591
You?

1607
01:29:52,257 --> 01:29:54,203
Get out of here. Go away.

1608
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:56,264
I don't want to see your face.

1609
01:29:56,328 --> 01:29:58,433
Listen to me, mom..
- I don't want to hear anything.

1610
01:29:58,497 --> 01:30:00,977
I don't want to hear anything.
Just go away. Just go away.

1611
01:30:01,433 --> 01:30:03,344
Your mother's dead.

1612
01:30:03,402 --> 01:30:04,608
Your mother's dead.

1613
01:30:05,637 --> 01:30:09,278
Just go away. Go away or I'll
kill myself right now. - No, mom.

1614
01:30:09,341 --> 01:30:11,753
Just go away. Just go away.
- I'm going.

1615
01:30:12,044 --> 01:30:14,081
Go away.
- I'm leaving.

1616
01:30:14,146 --> 01:30:15,716
Just go away.

1617
01:30:24,656 --> 01:30:26,294
Your decision isn't right.

1618
01:30:27,359 --> 01:30:30,465
Once you join the gang,
you won't have a way out.

1619
01:30:32,230 --> 01:30:34,267
Let's go and tell the police..
- No, Kajal.

1620
01:30:36,668 --> 01:30:37,738
Mom's in their captivity.

1621
01:30:39,271 --> 01:30:42,445
You won't tell the
police anything, Kajal.

1622
01:30:42,507 --> 01:30:43,451
For my sake.

1623
01:30:44,376 --> 01:30:46,583
But, Vishwas, how is thisâ
- Just forget me, Kajal.

1624
01:30:47,379 --> 01:30:50,326
Your world's full
of bright life, hopes.

1625
01:30:51,416 --> 01:30:53,487
My world's filled with
darkness and nothing else.

1626
01:30:56,488 --> 01:30:58,161
We cannot be together, Kajal.

1627
01:30:58,590 --> 01:30:59,500
Andâ

1628
01:31:01,059 --> 01:31:01,662
And?

1629
01:31:03,095 --> 01:31:04,005
And what?

1630
01:31:05,030 --> 01:31:06,134
Say it.

1631
01:31:13,005 --> 01:31:14,279
We won't meet again.

1632
01:31:18,276 --> 01:31:19,152
I'm sorry.

1633
01:31:23,015 --> 01:31:25,325
""Without me..""

1634
01:31:25,717 --> 01:31:28,527
""Without me..""

1635
01:31:28,587 --> 01:31:31,295
""Without me..""

1636
01:31:31,356 --> 01:31:33,529
""Without me..""

1637
01:31:33,792 --> 01:31:39,333
""Without me you'll be happier.""

1638
01:31:39,398 --> 01:31:44,643
""Don't let my thought
ever cross your mind.""

1639
01:31:45,237 --> 01:31:47,615
""Without me..""

1640
01:31:48,006 --> 01:31:50,452
""Without me..""

1641
01:31:50,709 --> 01:31:53,417
""Without me..""

1642
01:31:53,478 --> 01:31:57,221
""Without me..""

1643
01:32:06,691 --> 01:32:12,437
""I wonder where you're headed..""

1644
01:32:12,497 --> 01:32:17,742
""..leaving me at two ways.""

1645
01:32:18,036 --> 01:32:22,542
""You gave me happiness..""

1646
01:32:22,607 --> 01:32:28,216
""But you snatched it from me.""

1647
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:30,419
""What did you get.""

1648
01:32:31,083 --> 01:32:33,393
""What did you get.""

1649
01:32:33,752 --> 01:32:38,599
""What did you get by making me cry?""

1650
01:32:39,024 --> 01:32:44,201
""Don't let my thought
ever cross your mind.""

1651
01:32:44,763 --> 01:32:47,209
""Without me..""

1652
01:32:47,532 --> 01:32:50,308
""Without me..""

1653
01:32:50,368 --> 01:32:54,316
""Without me..""

1654
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:04,018
1000 kilos of cocaine,

1655
01:33:04,683 --> 01:33:06,321
will be delivered tomorrow afternoonâ

1656
01:33:06,384 --> 01:33:09,024
âto the special chamber
of the Versova warehouse.

1657
01:33:11,456 --> 01:33:14,096
The computerized lock will open..

1658
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:16,196
...only through the CD that I sent you.

1659
01:33:16,795 --> 01:33:19,605
Collect the consignment
and keep it in your warehouse.

1660
01:33:21,533 --> 01:33:22,603
I'm arriving day-after-tomorrow.

1661
01:33:22,667 --> 01:33:24,578
Same place, same time,

1662
01:33:25,637 --> 01:33:27,275
where I always land.

1663
01:33:27,339 --> 01:33:28,147
Good bye.

1664
01:33:29,074 --> 01:33:32,248
That's Napoleon sir's mission.

1665
01:33:32,744 --> 01:33:34,348
White elephant!

1666
01:33:34,646 --> 01:33:36,956
1000 kilos of cocaine!

1667
01:34:05,243 --> 01:34:06,517
Hands up. No one moves.

1668
01:34:06,578 --> 01:34:07,454
Load it. Load it.

1669
01:34:07,512 --> 01:34:08,422
Load the goods.

1670
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:10,687
Get down.
Get down. Jesse. Lock everybody up.

1671
01:34:10,749 --> 01:34:12,092
Lock everyone up.

1672
01:34:13,018 --> 01:34:13,428
Lock.

1673
01:34:13,485 --> 01:34:14,486
Lock them.

1674
01:34:15,587 --> 01:34:16,122
Lock.

1675
01:34:16,188 --> 01:34:19,692
Jesse. Call the area
in-charge and call them here.

1676
01:34:20,058 --> 01:34:22,504
I'm taking the truck
to the police warehouse.

1677
01:34:26,097 --> 01:34:27,405
Vishwas, you?

1678
01:34:47,252 --> 01:34:48,492
Vishwas.

1679
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:55,770
Sir..

1680
01:34:56,061 --> 01:34:58,667
How did Khare get there?

1681
01:34:58,730 --> 01:35:00,732
They're policemen;
they're bound to get there.

1682
01:35:00,799 --> 01:35:02,107
But why did Vishwas go there?

1683
01:35:02,167 --> 01:35:03,441
Didn't you tell him not to?

1684
01:35:03,501 --> 01:35:04,571
He's a novice.

1685
01:35:04,636 --> 01:35:06,081
The commissioner
must have arrested him..

1686
01:35:06,137 --> 01:35:07,207
âAnd he must have blurted everything.

1687
01:35:07,272 --> 01:35:08,751
And the police must
be on their way here.

1688
01:35:11,643 --> 01:35:13,680
We're dead.
- Saved.

1689
01:35:14,346 --> 01:35:16,485
Here's your enemy,
Joint Commissioner Khare.

1690
01:35:17,148 --> 01:35:19,128
And I've delivered your truck
loaded with goods to your warehouse.

1691
01:35:19,451 --> 01:35:21,453
Ghorpade.
- Yes, sir.

1692
01:35:21,519 --> 01:35:23,999
You here?
- I work second shift here, sir.

1693
01:35:24,256 --> 01:35:25,997
Aren't you ashamed?
- I am, sir.

1694
01:35:26,291 --> 01:35:28,100
Well done, Vishwas. Well done.

1695
01:35:28,159 --> 01:35:30,799
Napoleon sir will
be very pleased with you.

1696
01:35:31,162 --> 01:35:32,607
To heck with your Napoleon.

1697
01:35:32,664 --> 01:35:35,008
I'm doing this for my mom.

1698
01:35:35,533 --> 01:35:37,035
My mom's suffering here.

1699
01:35:37,335 --> 01:35:38,643
I want to take her
back to our village.

1700
01:35:38,703 --> 01:35:40,080
How can you go?

1701
01:35:40,138 --> 01:35:42,345
The entire Mumbai
police will come here..

1702
01:35:42,407 --> 01:35:44,011
...looking for Khare sir.

1703
01:35:44,075 --> 01:35:46,112
They won't.
- Why?

1704
01:35:46,177 --> 01:35:48,316
Because he'll inform his departmentâ

1705
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:50,485
...that he's going out
of the city for a few daysâ

1706
01:35:50,548 --> 01:35:52,459
âand they shouldn't look for him.
- No, I won't.

1707
01:35:54,419 --> 01:35:55,022
What?

1708
01:35:56,421 --> 01:35:57,764
You will.

1709
01:35:57,822 --> 01:35:59,563
You will say it and also help us.

1710
01:36:00,625 --> 01:36:03,162
Will you say it or not?

1711
01:36:04,195 --> 01:36:06,072
Speak.
- Yes, I will.

1712
01:36:06,431 --> 01:36:07,466
I will.

1713
01:36:08,066 --> 01:36:09,067
Good boy.

1714
01:36:09,134 --> 01:36:10,306
Tie him up.

1715
01:36:12,137 --> 01:36:13,775
Take some lessons from him, Ghorpade.

1716
01:36:14,839 --> 01:36:16,648
Take some lessons from him.

1717
01:36:19,144 --> 01:36:21,590
Why are you tying up this poor man?

1718
01:36:21,646 --> 01:36:22,716
TighUY-

1719
01:36:22,781 --> 01:36:25,557
Look, he's no police officer.

1720
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:28,023
He just likes to
roam around in uniform.

1721
01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:31,325
He's a television actor.

1722
01:36:31,389 --> 01:36:32,800
I know, I know.

1723
01:36:32,857 --> 01:36:34,336
There's no television in your room.

1724
01:36:34,392 --> 01:36:36,394
That's why we brought this actor here.

1725
01:36:36,461 --> 01:36:38,998
Now watch him perform.

1726
01:36:39,297 --> 01:36:40,241
Listenâ

1727
01:36:48,139 --> 01:36:49,140
Madam.

1728
01:36:51,009 --> 01:36:53,216
I am actually the joint
commissioner of police.

1729
01:36:54,713 --> 01:36:55,623
Let it be.

1730
01:36:56,381 --> 01:36:58,486
Get yourself treated by a good doctor.

1731
01:36:58,817 --> 01:37:00,694
No, try to understand.

1732
01:37:04,122 --> 01:37:06,398
Madam. These gang membersâ

1733
01:37:06,458 --> 01:37:08,369
âwere forcing Vishwas
to do a wrong deedâ

1734
01:37:08,426 --> 01:37:11,236
...by making the excuse
of your illness.

1735
01:37:11,563 --> 01:37:13,133
That's when he came to me.

1736
01:37:14,366 --> 01:37:16,243
I won't do anything wrong again, sir.

1737
01:37:17,469 --> 01:37:20,006
I've a suggestion, Vishwas.
- Yes, sir.

1738
01:37:20,305 --> 01:37:21,716
Just like Gundappa said,
collect the CD..

1739
01:37:21,773 --> 01:37:23,218
âAnd deliver it to him.

1740
01:37:24,075 --> 01:37:26,487
Do they pay you too?
- Oh shut up!

1741
01:37:26,778 --> 01:37:29,054
I want you to join Gundappa's gang.

1742
01:37:30,048 --> 01:37:31,493
That means they definitely do.

1743
01:37:31,549 --> 01:37:32,653
L-ley, sit down!

1744
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:36,665
I've a plan.

1745
01:37:37,255 --> 01:37:40,600
This way we can eradicate
Gundappa and his gang.

1746
01:37:41,059 --> 01:37:42,265
And that's why..

1747
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:45,666
...I want you to execute
this job and enter his gang.

1748
01:37:46,364 --> 01:37:49,971
I want you to join their
gang and extract informationâ

1749
01:37:50,468 --> 01:37:51,708
I got it, sir.

1750
01:37:53,004 --> 01:37:55,143
Just like Amitabh
Bachchan did in 'Don'.

1751
01:37:55,206 --> 01:37:56,184
Right, sir?

1752
01:37:56,608 --> 01:37:58,019
Yes.

1753
01:37:58,710 --> 01:38:03,352
And if you do that, they will
pay for your mother's surgery.

1754
01:38:03,415 --> 01:38:04,689
She will receive treatment.

1755
01:38:05,350 --> 01:38:08,524
And you will join their gang
and work as a police informer.

1756
01:38:09,587 --> 01:38:11,260
I will work for the police?

1757
01:38:12,524 --> 01:38:15,164
My mother will be really happy.

1758
01:38:15,593 --> 01:38:17,698
Sister, for your happinessâ

1759
01:38:17,762 --> 01:38:20,208
âVishwas agreed to do
policeman's job.

1760
01:38:20,598 --> 01:38:25,069
While doing this job,
you will kill two policemen.

1761
01:38:25,136 --> 01:38:26,547
What are you saying, sir?

1762
01:38:26,604 --> 01:38:29,278
Not really. Fake bullets. Fake deaths.

1763
01:38:30,475 --> 01:38:34,787
This way Gundappa
will start trusting you.

1764
01:38:35,146 --> 01:38:38,025
And he won't kill you,
instead he'll let you join his gang.

1765
01:38:38,416 --> 01:38:40,293
What an idea, sir.

1766
01:38:40,585 --> 01:38:43,429
No one can imagine
that you can think so well.

1767
01:38:43,488 --> 01:38:44,432
Thank you.

1768
01:38:44,489 --> 01:38:45,661
What did you say?
- See you, sir.

1769
01:38:46,057 --> 01:38:47,536
Stop.
- What now?

1770
01:38:48,059 --> 01:38:49,697
Vishwas, keep this watch.

1771
01:38:49,761 --> 01:38:51,741
Whenever you press this buttonâ.

1772
01:38:52,130 --> 01:38:53,700
...a light will blink
on the other watch.

1773
01:38:53,998 --> 01:38:56,478
After that,
regardless of where we are..

1774
01:38:56,534 --> 01:38:59,674
âWe can talk to each other,
through this watch-phone.

1775
01:39:00,171 --> 01:39:00,672
<i>Now watch.</i>

1776
01:39:00,738 --> 01:39:03,218
I'll talk and you listen.
- Sir.

1777
01:39:04,609 --> 01:39:06,111
Hello, Vishwas.

1778
01:39:06,611 --> 01:39:07,715
I've entrusted you with the jobâ

1779
01:39:07,779 --> 01:39:10,089
...of a secret agent
for the Mumbai Police.

1780
01:39:10,615 --> 01:39:14,085
You'll have to do this
job with great responsibility.

1781
01:39:14,552 --> 01:39:15,997
Are you listening?

1782
01:39:16,588 --> 01:39:18,693
Of course, sir. I'm with you, sir.

1783
01:39:19,324 --> 01:39:22,396
You had to stand there and
listen over the watch-phone, idiot!

1784
01:39:23,228 --> 01:39:24,400
Where are you going?

1785
01:39:24,462 --> 01:39:26,066
To stand there and listen, sir.

1786
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:27,131
Vishwas.

1787
01:39:27,198 --> 01:39:28,142
Sir..

1788
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,643
Will you be able to do this job?

1789
01:39:30,702 --> 01:39:32,340
Of course, sir.
I'll do it really well.

1790
01:39:33,304 --> 01:39:34,146
Okay.

1791
01:39:35,540 --> 01:39:37,315
Then keep this phone.
- Thank you, sir.

1792
01:39:37,375 --> 01:39:38,718
But I have a phone.

1793
01:39:38,776 --> 01:39:41,484
This isn't for making calls, Vishwas.

1794
01:39:41,546 --> 01:39:44,322
When you press this button twice..

1795
01:39:44,382 --> 01:39:46,726
...It will give out a blinding flashâ

1796
01:39:47,018 --> 01:39:50,124
âand severe everyone's
vision for a while.

1797
01:39:50,188 --> 01:39:52,464
This will help you
when you're in trouble.

1798
01:39:52,757 --> 01:39:54,065
Wonderful, sir.

1799
01:39:54,125 --> 01:39:56,298
You just turned me
into James Bond, sir.

1800
01:39:57,462 --> 01:39:59,237
Why did you press the button now?

1801
01:39:59,297 --> 01:40:00,674
I was testing it, sir.

1802
01:40:00,732 --> 01:40:03,611
You could've told me so.
I would've closed my eyes.

1803
01:40:04,135 --> 01:40:06,445
Now listen.
- Sir, I can't see a thing.

1804
01:40:06,504 --> 01:40:09,508
You need ears to listen.

1805
01:40:09,574 --> 01:40:10,746
I do have ears, sir.

1806
01:40:11,042 --> 01:40:13,579
So, look..
- I can't see, sir.

1807
01:40:13,645 --> 01:40:17,650
Oh God! Listen and understand.
- Yes, sir.

1808
01:40:18,049 --> 01:40:21,519
The secret, that you're
working for Mumbai Police..

1809
01:40:21,586 --> 01:40:23,361
...you won't reveal it to anyone.

1810
01:40:23,421 --> 01:40:25,264
Not even your mother.
- Why, sir?

1811
01:40:25,323 --> 01:40:28,600
If the gang-members find out,
they will shoot you.

1812
01:40:29,027 --> 01:40:30,370
And if you have an
encounter with the police..

1813
01:40:30,428 --> 01:40:32,305
âThey will kill you too.
- Oh God!

1814
01:40:32,363 --> 01:40:33,501
But why, sir?

1815
01:40:33,565 --> 01:40:36,171
I'm working for the police.
- Yes.

1816
01:40:36,234 --> 01:40:39,272
You know it, I know it..

1817
01:40:39,337 --> 01:40:41,408
...but the police department doesn't.

1818
01:40:41,472 --> 01:40:42,712
I can see again.

1819
01:40:43,675 --> 01:40:44,676
Where are you?

1820
01:40:45,443 --> 01:40:46,581
There you are.
- Sirâ

1821
01:40:47,278 --> 01:40:48,313
Sir, I suggest that
you write it down on paperâ

1822
01:40:48,379 --> 01:40:49,323
âthat I work for
the police departmentâ

1823
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:50,450
âand keep it somewhere safe.
- Why?

1824
01:40:50,515 --> 01:40:53,223
Because,
if you die I'll be in trouble.

1825
01:40:53,518 --> 01:40:55,395
Amitabh had to face lot
of problems in 'Don', sir.

1826
01:40:55,453 --> 01:40:57,626
Fine, fine. I will.

1827
01:40:57,689 --> 01:41:00,260
But now you go and execute
your mission cautiously.

1828
01:41:00,325 --> 01:41:01,303
Good luck.

1829
01:41:02,226 --> 01:41:04,934
Vishwas is working for the police.

1830
01:41:06,331 --> 01:41:08,333
Is it true, Mr. Commissioner?

1831
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:10,208
Absolutely true.

1832
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:14,546
No, madam. Please don't cry.

1833
01:41:15,106 --> 01:41:17,382
Vishwas is always worried about you.

1834
01:41:17,709 --> 01:41:18,744
Please don't worry.

1835
01:41:19,210 --> 01:41:20,689
Everything will be alright.

1836
01:41:21,179 --> 01:41:22,522
Goddess.

1837
01:41:23,414 --> 01:41:28,227
Let my Vishwas be
successful in his mission.

1838
01:41:28,286 --> 01:41:30,527
We've to foil Vishwas'
mission at any cost.

1839
01:41:30,588 --> 01:41:32,590
We should stop him from
committing anymore crime.

1840
01:41:32,657 --> 01:41:34,568
You said he's joined some gang.

1841
01:41:34,626 --> 01:41:36,469
What can we possibly do now?

1842
01:41:37,295 --> 01:41:40,674
We should do something to
foil the entire gang's mission.

1843
01:41:40,732 --> 01:41:42,473
And Vishwas gets the credit for it.

1844
01:41:42,533 --> 01:41:44,513
And he becomes a hero
in the view of the law.

1845
01:41:44,569 --> 01:41:45,639
Hero?

1846
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:49,017
To be the hero one
needs to kill the villain.

1847
01:41:49,273 --> 01:41:50,274
Tell me one thingâ

1848
01:41:50,341 --> 01:41:51,649
In his film..
- What?

1849
01:41:51,709 --> 01:41:55,350
Sorry. Who's the villain in his story?

1850
01:42:03,021 --> 01:42:04,261
Yes!

1851
01:42:04,322 --> 01:42:05,426
Napoleon sir.

1852
01:42:05,490 --> 01:42:08,232
I've configured this
just like you wanted me to.

1853
01:42:08,292 --> 01:42:10,033
Ready to go.
- Very good.

1854
01:42:10,695 --> 01:42:11,571
Ready to...go.

1855
01:42:14,232 --> 01:42:15,404
Relax, gentlemen.

1856
01:42:15,466 --> 01:42:16,467
Relax.

1857
01:42:17,335 --> 01:42:21,112
He knew too much about
our mission White Elephant.

1858
01:42:21,372 --> 01:42:22,646
I don't take chances.

1859
01:42:24,008 --> 01:42:25,282
Now I'm ready.

1860
01:42:25,643 --> 01:42:28,385
Ready to tighten the
noose around Mumbai's neck.

1861
01:42:28,746 --> 01:42:30,521
As soon as I wring Mumbai's neckâ

1862
01:42:30,782 --> 01:42:32,659
âentire India will scream.

1863
01:42:34,152 --> 01:42:37,133
Your organization's motive
will be fulfilled soon.

1864
01:42:37,188 --> 01:42:38,963
And what if you fail?

1865
01:42:39,424 --> 01:42:42,962
Remember,
you can deceive the Indian Police..

1866
01:42:43,294 --> 01:42:44,602
âBut not us.

1867
01:42:45,596 --> 01:42:49,009
You know what we canâ

1868
01:42:49,567 --> 01:42:51,342
âand are capable of doing.

1869
01:42:51,402 --> 01:42:54,474
Escaped convict
inspector Yeshwant Rao.

1870
01:42:56,574 --> 01:43:00,215
You shouldn't utter
the name of the dead.

1871
01:43:01,479 --> 01:43:04,426
Napoleon always completes his mission.

1872
01:43:05,383 --> 01:43:07,954
Everyone knows that in our world.

1873
01:43:08,352 --> 01:43:11,128
Transfer the money in my account.

1874
01:43:13,324 --> 01:43:14,735
Goodbye.

1875
01:43:17,361 --> 01:43:19,534
What's wrong, sir?
You called for me urgently.

1876
01:43:19,797 --> 01:43:22,038
You know her?
- Hello.

1877
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,207
You? Who are you?

1878
01:43:25,269 --> 01:43:27,579
Well done! Bravo, son!

1879
01:43:27,638 --> 01:43:30,118
Today you refuse to
recognise my daughter.

1880
01:43:30,174 --> 01:43:32,245
But I hope you recognise me.

1881
01:43:32,310 --> 01:43:33,755
Thakur Joginder Singh.

1882
01:43:34,178 --> 01:43:35,350
Who are they, sir?

1883
01:43:35,413 --> 01:43:37,120
Let's kill him, father..
- Let's kidnap him, father.

1884
01:43:37,181 --> 01:43:38,524
Shut up you fool.

1885
01:43:39,016 --> 01:43:41,326
Do you want to make
your sister a widow?

1886
01:43:41,686 --> 01:43:44,292
Have you thought
what we'll tell Manglu?

1887
01:43:44,555 --> 01:43:47,468
Manglu? Who's Manglu?
- I don't know, sir.

1888
01:43:47,525 --> 01:43:49,095
Let's kill him, father..
- Let's kidnap him, father..

1889
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:51,140
Quiet. We'll kill him,
we'll kidnap him.

1890
01:43:51,662 --> 01:43:54,006
But for now,
we're here to talk marriage.

1891
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:57,508
Stop that, Priest.

1892
01:43:57,568 --> 01:43:59,445
He's right. Don't waste it.

1893
01:43:59,971 --> 01:44:01,473
Now he'll convince the groom.

1894
01:44:01,773 --> 01:44:04,219
Uncle Gundu.
- Gundu?

1895
01:44:04,275 --> 01:44:05,015
Yes, you.

1896
01:44:05,076 --> 01:44:06,714
Convince him or we'll call the police.

1897
01:44:07,011 --> 01:44:09,719
Give me your phone.
- No police. No police.

1898
01:44:10,014 --> 01:44:11,493
Wow! it must be telepathy,
the police are already here.

1899
01:44:11,549 --> 01:44:14,655
Lovely India, dear.
- Sir, you called me urgently.

1900
01:44:14,719 --> 01:44:17,461
Who are they?
- Kajal? You here?

1901
01:44:17,522 --> 01:44:19,524
Thank God, at least you recognised me.

1902
01:44:19,590 --> 01:44:22,332
Do you know her?
- Yes. She's complaint Kajal.

1903
01:44:22,393 --> 01:44:24,395
She always comes to the
police station with a complaint.

1904
01:44:24,462 --> 01:44:25,668
I've a complaint today as well.

1905
01:44:25,730 --> 01:44:27,403
Who's it about?
- Him.

1906
01:44:28,099 --> 01:44:31,478
He loved me. We sung duets.

1907
01:44:31,536 --> 01:44:35,211
He promised to marry me. Andâ
- No.

1908
01:44:37,208 --> 01:44:40,678
No, dear.
Don't get into too much detail.

1909
01:44:41,145 --> 01:44:43,625
You've already lost your honour.

1910
01:44:43,681 --> 01:44:46,321
Now think about your father.

1911
01:44:46,384 --> 01:44:47,761
Sir, they're all lying.

1912
01:44:48,419 --> 01:44:50,524
Let's kill him, father..
- Let's kidnap him, father.

1913
01:44:50,588 --> 01:44:51,566
Shut up you fool.

1914
01:44:52,089 --> 01:44:56,765
If we kill him,
what are we going to tell Manglu?

1915
01:44:56,828 --> 01:44:59,468
Manglu? Who's Manglu?
- I don't know, Gundappa sir.

1916
01:44:59,530 --> 01:45:01,532
Let's kill him, father..
- Let's kidnap him, father.

1917
01:45:01,599 --> 01:45:03,408
Violence again!

1918
01:45:03,467 --> 01:45:05,276
Small moustache, big mouth.

1919
01:45:05,336 --> 01:45:09,307
If we kill him,
what are we going to tell Manglu?

1920
01:45:09,373 --> 01:45:10,613
Just a minute.

1921
01:45:10,675 --> 01:45:12,655
Who is Manglu?

1922
01:45:12,710 --> 01:45:15,247
You don't know about Manglu, sir?
- No, I don't.

1923
01:45:16,714 --> 01:45:18,159
Manglu. Little son.

1924
01:45:18,216 --> 01:45:20,389
Vishwas' little son. Still to be born.

1925
01:45:20,451 --> 01:45:22,453
He's still in my daughter's womb.

1926
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:23,521
Manglu. Hold this, son.

1927
01:45:23,588 --> 01:45:25,499
Vishwas. What is this?

1928
01:45:25,556 --> 01:45:27,126
I don't know, sir. This is not mine.

1929
01:45:27,191 --> 01:45:28,761
Shut up. Come here.

1930
01:45:28,826 --> 01:45:33,536
Come here. Come here.
Look. Napoleon sir's arriving tonight.

1931
01:45:33,598 --> 01:45:36,772
If they mess up anything,
then we'll be dead.

1932
01:45:36,834 --> 01:45:39,405
Just tell me clearly.
If you don't know themâ

1933
01:45:39,470 --> 01:45:41,143
...I'll kill them right
now and bury them here.

1934
01:45:42,206 --> 01:45:43,150
Now tell me clearly.

1935
01:45:43,207 --> 01:45:45,983
Did you have any
relation with this girl?

1936
01:45:50,314 --> 01:45:51,292
A little.

1937
01:45:51,782 --> 01:45:53,125
Just a little?

1938
01:45:57,455 --> 01:45:59,696
A little more.

1939
01:45:59,757 --> 01:46:01,395
Oh Godâ

1940
01:46:03,728 --> 01:46:07,175
Look. I've convinced
Vishwas for the marriage.

1941
01:46:08,332 --> 01:46:10,642
Stop that, Priest.
Or I will shoot you.

1942
01:46:11,102 --> 01:46:12,706
I just convinced him for now.

1943
01:46:14,071 --> 01:46:14,742
Look.

1944
01:46:14,805 --> 01:46:16,250
We've an important job to do.

1945
01:46:16,307 --> 01:46:18,253
We'll first finish that
job and then the wedding.

1946
01:46:18,309 --> 01:46:20,755
That's called justice.

1947
01:46:21,045 --> 01:46:22,991
His Majesty's justice.

1948
01:46:23,547 --> 01:46:25,788
I won't say it! I won't say it!

1949
01:46:25,850 --> 01:46:26,692
I won't say it!

1950
01:46:26,751 --> 01:46:28,753
You'll have to say it, sir!
Right, sir?

1951
01:46:29,053 --> 01:46:31,363
What, sir?
Tell him what he has to say.

1952
01:46:31,422 --> 01:46:35,393
He'll say it. - Sir,
you'll have to make up an excuseâ

1953
01:46:35,459 --> 01:46:38,497
âand divert the coast
guards at Gorai tonight.

1954
01:46:38,562 --> 01:46:39,472
Okay?

1955
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:43,640
I will shoot you, sir.

1956
01:46:44,201 --> 01:46:46,306
I won't say it even if you shoot me.

1957
01:46:46,370 --> 01:46:49,749
You're refusing us?
I will cut off your nose.

1958
01:46:50,041 --> 01:46:51,714
No, not my nose.

1959
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:53,619
Then I'll cut off your tongue.

1960
01:46:54,445 --> 01:46:56,186
If you do that, how will I speak?
- Yeah.

1961
01:46:56,247 --> 01:46:58,750
You will say it, won't you
- Of course I will.

1962
01:46:58,816 --> 01:47:00,454
I will. I will.

1963
01:47:00,518 --> 01:47:02,589
I will do just as you say.

1964
01:47:03,154 --> 01:47:04,724
Take some lessons, Ghorpade.

1965
01:47:05,289 --> 01:47:07,291
Take some lessons from him.
- Yes, sir.

1966
01:47:07,358 --> 01:47:08,234
God bless you.

1967
01:47:10,528 --> 01:47:12,166
Sir. You asked for a knife.

1968
01:47:12,229 --> 01:47:13,731
Here's the knife.
- Thank you.

1969
01:47:14,031 --> 01:47:16,341
But, sir. You've diverted the police.

1970
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:17,777
How will they catch Napoleon now?

1971
01:47:17,835 --> 01:47:19,473
We don't catch Napoleon tonight.

1972
01:47:19,537 --> 01:47:22,643
We've to catch Napoleon tonight.
- No worry.

1973
01:47:22,707 --> 01:47:25,244
Even if the police
manage to catch Napoleon..

1974
01:47:25,309 --> 01:47:28,051
âWe won't find his
other agents in India.

1975
01:47:28,112 --> 01:47:31,423
We'll prove that capturing
Napoleon was Vishwas' plan.

1976
01:47:31,849 --> 01:47:34,090
Yes. - And Vishwas'
crimes will be pardoned.

1977
01:47:34,485 --> 01:47:36,158
Then he'll become a hero tomorrow.

1978
01:47:36,220 --> 01:47:37,198
Not tomorrow, but the day-afterâ

1979
01:47:37,254 --> 01:47:38,756
...we'll arrest Napoleon,
his entire gangâ

1980
01:47:38,823 --> 01:47:41,133
âand all his agents red-handed.

1981
01:47:41,192 --> 01:47:43,138
Wow! What a plan, sir.

1982
01:48:05,783 --> 01:48:06,693
Napoleon!

1983
01:48:06,751 --> 01:48:08,196
Surrender yourself.

1984
01:48:24,568 --> 01:48:26,570
One year of hard work..

1985
01:48:27,371 --> 01:48:29,442
âWas foiled in a single night.

1986
01:48:30,641 --> 01:48:33,121
All because of one traitor.

1987
01:48:34,245 --> 01:48:35,315
Who is it?

1988
01:48:37,448 --> 01:48:38,688
Who is it?

1989
01:48:40,217 --> 01:48:42,254
Who is the traitor amongst you..

1990
01:48:42,319 --> 01:48:43,662
âThat informed the police?

1991
01:48:43,721 --> 01:48:46,668
The police...arrived
their coincidentally, sir.

1992
01:48:46,724 --> 01:48:50,069
It was no coincidence!

1993
01:48:50,661 --> 01:48:53,107
They came prepared.

1994
01:48:54,131 --> 01:48:57,112
Thank God I managed to save this bag.

1995
01:48:57,535 --> 01:48:59,981
Otherwise,
everything would've been over.

1996
01:49:00,805 --> 01:49:03,285
This mission can't be completedâ

1997
01:49:03,340 --> 01:49:05,251
...without this bag.

1998
01:49:07,144 --> 01:49:09,090
Find that traitor.

1999
01:49:09,547 --> 01:49:11,720
Otherwise, I will kill all of you.

2000
01:49:12,216 --> 01:49:13,194
Sir.

2001
01:49:15,186 --> 01:49:16,494
I doubt someone.

2002
01:49:20,291 --> 01:49:22,532
You doubt me? Me?

2003
01:49:23,194 --> 01:49:25,196
I could've been arrested as well.

2004
01:49:25,696 --> 01:49:27,676
I could've died in
the police firing as well.

2005
01:49:28,599 --> 01:49:30,078
How could you forget Gundappa sir..

2006
01:49:30,134 --> 01:49:31,579
...who risked his life
to bring you that CD?

2007
01:49:32,236 --> 01:49:33,146
Me.

2008
01:49:34,805 --> 01:49:36,580
I had to kill two policemen
and I didn't hesitateâ

2009
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:38,517
âjust for your CD, Gundappa sir.

2010
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:41,956
But you still doubt me.

2011
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:43,584
Mel

2012
01:49:47,518 --> 01:49:48,929
Hello, aunt.

2013
01:49:49,487 --> 01:49:51,398
You here?

2014
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:53,735
These goons abducted you too.

2015
01:49:53,791 --> 01:49:55,361
They can't abduct me.

2016
01:49:55,426 --> 01:49:58,066
I came here willingly.
- What?

2017
01:49:58,329 --> 01:50:01,105
And that day,
I brought your truck safe and soundâ

2018
01:50:01,165 --> 01:50:02,576
âfrom the warehouse!

2019
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:05,971
And also brought your enemy Khare.

2020
01:50:07,304 --> 01:50:09,181
But you stillâ

2021
01:50:13,777 --> 01:50:17,520
My son's doing a good job here.
- Good job?

2022
01:50:18,082 --> 01:50:20,722
Did you join the gang
along with your son?

2023
01:50:21,485 --> 01:50:25,365
If you still don't trust me..

2024
01:50:25,422 --> 01:50:26,992
Then it's better that I die.

2025
01:50:27,358 --> 01:50:29,065
Then it's better that I die.

2026
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:33,033
My son's working for the police.

2027
01:50:34,231 --> 01:50:35,437
Police!

2028
01:50:35,499 --> 01:50:37,410
But, Gundappa sir..

2029
01:50:38,035 --> 01:50:40,709
...I don't want you
to shed innocent blood.

2030
01:50:41,172 --> 01:50:42,981
That's why I'm going to kill myself.

2031
01:50:43,641 --> 01:50:45,018
Give me the gun.

2032
01:50:45,309 --> 01:50:46,481
Give me the gun.

2033
01:50:46,544 --> 01:50:47,614
Give me the gun.

2034
01:50:48,212 --> 01:50:48,656
You give it.

2035
01:50:49,079 --> 01:50:50,114
Give it.

2036
01:50:50,581 --> 01:50:51,559
Stop it, Vishwas.

2037
01:50:54,585 --> 01:50:56,565
Gundappa, what do you think?

2038
01:50:56,620 --> 01:51:01,194
Sir. I think it's
a sin to doubt this boy.

2039
01:51:03,327 --> 01:51:04,397
Sorry, Vishwas.

2040
01:51:04,662 --> 01:51:05,697
Boys, come back.

2041
01:51:05,996 --> 01:51:07,100
Go. Go.

2042
01:51:11,001 --> 01:51:13,607
Sorry. Sorry.
- It's okay.

2043
01:51:13,671 --> 01:51:15,116
Sorry, Vishwas.

2044
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:18,316
I'm really sorry. Forgive me.

2045
01:51:19,210 --> 01:51:21,053
It was a mistake.
- Its okay.

2046
01:51:21,111 --> 01:51:22,215
No problem. Go.

2047
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:26,657
Don't drive me away.
- I'm not angry.

2048
01:51:26,717 --> 01:51:30,358
This is my love for you.

2049
01:51:30,421 --> 01:51:31,729
Go, go, goodbye.

2050
01:51:32,823 --> 01:51:34,063
Mom just told me.

2051
01:51:34,124 --> 01:51:37,537
I don't care what
your mom said to you.

2052
01:51:37,595 --> 01:51:39,336
Your mom said that the policeâ

2053
01:51:39,396 --> 01:51:42,002
Don't try to threaten me.

2054
01:51:42,066 --> 01:51:44,205
I cannot marry you.
- What?

2055
01:51:44,501 --> 01:51:47,141
I've things to do for uncle Gundu.

2056
01:51:47,204 --> 01:51:49,684
Learn, Ghorpade.
Learn from him. He's our benefactor.

2057
01:51:49,740 --> 01:51:54,655
He's our God.

2058
01:51:54,712 --> 01:51:57,454
How much longer are you
going to fool that stupid Gundu?

2059
01:51:58,449 --> 01:51:59,689
Your mom has told me everythingâ

2060
01:51:59,984 --> 01:52:01,930
âthat you're working for the police.

2061
01:52:03,053 --> 01:52:05,158
You're fooling everyone here.
- No.

2062
01:52:06,056 --> 01:52:08,127
Now, together we'll
apprehend the entire gang.

2063
01:52:08,192 --> 01:52:09,193
Yahoo!

2064
01:52:09,260 --> 01:52:11,206
See. I am right.

2065
01:52:11,528 --> 01:52:13,064
Why are you quiet? Say something.

2066
01:52:13,130 --> 01:52:15,110
Now it's their turn to say.

2067
01:52:17,134 --> 01:52:18,135
Come on.

2068
01:52:19,003 --> 01:52:20,141
The boss has called you.
- Come.

2069
01:52:26,477 --> 01:52:27,421
Hello. Hello.

2070
01:52:27,478 --> 01:52:29,219
We're caught now, Kajal.

2071
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:31,692
Only God can save us
from Napoleon's wrath now.

2072
01:52:31,749 --> 01:52:33,751
The one who listens to me,
protect my honor.

2073
01:52:36,387 --> 01:52:38,230
Gundappa. Whafve you got to say now?

2074
01:52:38,289 --> 01:52:41,498
Sir, it'll be a sin to trust this boy.

2075
01:52:41,558 --> 01:52:43,663
I want to shoot him.
- Enough.

2076
01:52:44,628 --> 01:52:46,369
Do you two have
anything to say? - Yes.

2077
01:52:46,664 --> 01:52:48,473
I'm very, very sorry sir.
- Hey!

2078
01:52:48,532 --> 01:52:50,534
I mean, we're very, very sorry sir.

2079
01:52:50,601 --> 01:52:51,705
We made a mistake.

2080
01:52:51,769 --> 01:52:53,373
I didn't know there
was a camera up there.

2081
01:52:53,437 --> 01:52:55,417
Otherwise,
I wouldn't have said what I did.

2082
01:52:56,040 --> 01:52:57,041
Lovely India.

2083
01:52:57,107 --> 01:53:00,714
The adorable couple together.

2084
01:53:00,778 --> 01:53:02,155
And in the Yoga pose.

2085
01:53:02,212 --> 01:53:04,453
Stop it, Guruji.
- Why should I?

2086
01:53:04,515 --> 01:53:07,155
We've already fooled uncle Gundu..

2087
01:53:07,217 --> 01:53:09,561
Now there's going to be celebrations.

2088
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:11,463
Singing and dancing.

2089
01:53:11,522 --> 01:53:12,728
Stop this charade.

2090
01:53:12,790 --> 01:53:13,928
Shut up!

2091
01:53:16,327 --> 01:53:17,965
Why didn't you tell me?

2092
01:53:19,229 --> 01:53:21,675
Who's this new character,
Jackie Shroff type?

2093
01:53:22,166 --> 01:53:24,077
Boys. Ready to fire!

2094
01:53:26,337 --> 01:53:31,753
Sir...I've one last
wish...before I die.

2095
01:53:31,809 --> 01:53:32,549
What?

2096
01:53:34,144 --> 01:53:37,148
I want to hear the 'Gayatri
Mantra' before I die.

2097
01:53:37,214 --> 01:53:39,353
Where do we get the
'Gayatri Mantra' from?

2098
01:53:39,416 --> 01:53:41,953
I have it, sir.
I have it. On my phone.

2099
01:53:43,053 --> 01:53:44,225
See.

2100
01:53:44,288 --> 01:53:45,289
You can hear it too.

2101
01:53:45,356 --> 01:53:46,699
It'll wash away some of your sins.

2102
01:53:46,990 --> 01:53:49,527
And we'll leave this world.

2103
01:53:49,593 --> 01:53:50,571
Fine, fine, hurry up.

2104
01:53:50,627 --> 01:53:52,334
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

2105
01:53:52,396 --> 01:53:54,342
Come on, everyone close your eyes.

2106
01:53:54,398 --> 01:53:56,241
We're going to die anyway,
why close our..

2107
01:53:56,300 --> 01:53:57,711
Just close your eyes!

2108
01:53:57,768 --> 01:54:00,044
Close your eyes.

2109
01:54:04,341 --> 01:54:05,285
Why can't I see?

2110
01:54:06,710 --> 01:54:08,189
Don't shoot me.

2111
01:54:08,479 --> 01:54:09,685
Open your eyes.
- Why?

2112
01:54:09,980 --> 01:54:12,085
Close the doors. Don't let them run.

2113
01:54:12,149 --> 01:54:13,355
<i>Ru-M</i>

2114
01:54:14,685 --> 01:54:15,925
Come on, quickly.

2115
01:54:16,286 --> 01:54:17,731
I won't let you go. I will catch you.

2116
01:54:18,021 --> 01:54:20,695
Caught one, sir.
- Idiot, this is my hand.

2117
01:54:20,991 --> 01:54:22,299
Hey, here.. here.. here.

2118
01:54:22,359 --> 01:54:23,667
Close the doors.

2119
01:54:24,628 --> 01:54:27,108
That way.
- Sir, caught one.

2120
01:54:27,164 --> 01:54:28,643
It's me again.

2121
01:54:28,699 --> 01:54:30,007
Sorry, sir.

2122
01:54:30,067 --> 01:54:32,240
Where is everyone?

2123
01:54:32,302 --> 01:54:34,578
Close the door on the left.

2124
01:54:35,072 --> 01:54:37,018
That's the shortcut.

2125
01:54:37,374 --> 01:54:38,409
Left! Left!

2126
01:54:38,475 --> 01:54:39,579
Where are you going?

2127
01:54:39,643 --> 01:54:41,953
Where are you going?
How will you run away like that?

2128
01:54:42,780 --> 01:54:44,726
I can see everything.

2129
01:54:44,782 --> 01:54:47,194
Vishwasl Stay there. Stay there.

2130
01:54:49,753 --> 01:54:51,130
They escaped.

2131
01:54:52,122 --> 01:54:53,760
Don't just stand there, find them.

2132
01:54:53,824 --> 01:54:56,304
They took my bag too.
- Which bag, sir?

2133
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:59,136
My bag's essential for my mission.

2134
01:54:59,196 --> 01:55:02,234
Go. Get Vishwas' mother.
- Yes, sir.

2135
01:55:05,602 --> 01:55:07,445
Who kept the door open?

2136
01:55:07,704 --> 01:55:09,547
He escaped.

2137
01:55:10,607 --> 01:55:12,416
He took the mother along.

2138
01:55:12,709 --> 01:55:13,744
Sir, he's written something here.

2139
01:55:14,044 --> 01:55:15,318
So read it.

2140
01:55:15,379 --> 01:55:17,655
""The food here is really pathetic.""

2141
01:55:17,714 --> 01:55:20,661
""Please change the cook,
Joint Commissioner Khare.""

2142
01:55:21,251 --> 01:55:23,356
Fool.
- No, sir. He's absolutely right.

2143
01:55:23,420 --> 01:55:24,660
I've complained about this too.

2144
01:55:24,721 --> 01:55:26,428
The food's really pathetic.
- Shut up!

2145
01:55:39,636 --> 01:55:41,377
Sir. Inspector Jesse reporting, sir.

2146
01:55:41,438 --> 01:55:42,212
What's the news?

2147
01:55:42,473 --> 01:55:43,543
Gundappa's den is empty, sir.

2148
01:55:43,607 --> 01:55:44,312
What?

2149
01:55:44,374 --> 01:55:45,682
They've fled.
- Keep informing.

2150
01:55:45,742 --> 01:55:46,550
Yes, sir.

2151
01:55:51,215 --> 01:55:53,525
This isn't cocaine, sir.
- What?

2152
01:55:53,584 --> 01:55:54,562
It's powder.

2153
01:55:55,118 --> 01:55:57,325
Are you sure?
- 100% sure, sir.

2154
01:56:03,393 --> 01:56:04,371
Yes, Vishwas. Where are you?

2155
01:56:04,428 --> 01:56:07,238
Sir, we've escaped from
Gundappa's den. - Very good.

2156
01:56:07,297 --> 01:56:08,435
We've escaped too.

2157
01:56:08,499 --> 01:56:10,137
And mom?
- She's fine.

2158
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:12,339
And Kajal?
I sent Kajal to meet up with you.

2159
01:56:12,402 --> 01:56:13,745
Yes, she's here too.

2160
01:56:14,037 --> 01:56:16,643
She's with your mother.
Both are under police protection.

2161
01:56:16,707 --> 01:56:17,777
Listen to me.

2162
01:56:17,841 --> 01:56:19,445
Napoleon's tricked us.

2163
01:56:19,510 --> 01:56:21,421
That truck wasn't filled with cocaine.

2164
01:56:21,478 --> 01:56:22,786
It was some bogus powder.

2165
01:56:23,080 --> 01:56:26,527
That means 'Mission White
Elephant' is something else.

2166
01:56:26,583 --> 01:56:28,756
Sir, whatever it is,
it's in a black bag.

2167
01:56:29,052 --> 01:56:31,692
And that black bag's with me.
- Very good.

2168
01:56:31,755 --> 01:56:35,567
Get that bag to Crime
Branch Special Unit Zone 3!

2169
01:56:35,626 --> 01:56:37,196
That's where I am.
- Yes, sir.

2170
01:56:45,536 --> 01:56:47,538
I am not a policeman,
but Napoleon's man.

2171
01:56:55,579 --> 01:56:58,025
Hello.
- We've abducted your mother.

2172
01:56:59,283 --> 01:57:02,287
Get that black bag back
to Vasai Fort in one hour.

2173
01:57:03,253 --> 01:57:06,234
Once you're there,
I'll give you further directions.

2174
01:57:06,657 --> 01:57:09,399
You've only 60 minutes.

2175
01:57:10,661 --> 01:57:15,041
If you try to act smart,
you will never find your mother again.

2176
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:17,672
Seal the entire city.

2177
01:57:17,734 --> 01:57:20,214
Set up check-posts.
- May I come in, sir?

2178
01:57:20,270 --> 01:57:21,340
Come, Vishwas.

2179
01:57:22,272 --> 01:57:23,512
Vishwas, there's bad news for you.

2180
01:57:23,574 --> 01:57:24,712
I know, sir.

2181
01:57:24,775 --> 01:57:26,345
Napoleon has kidnapped my mother.

2182
01:57:27,311 --> 01:57:28,688
How did you know?

2183
01:57:28,745 --> 01:57:30,156
He just called, sir.

2184
01:57:30,747 --> 01:57:33,557
He said, ""if I don't return
him this bag in an hour..""

2185
01:57:33,850 --> 01:57:35,420
""..he will kill my mother"".

2186
01:57:36,587 --> 01:57:37,691
Here, sir.

2187
01:57:38,155 --> 01:57:39,725
Yet you brought this bag here.

2188
01:57:39,790 --> 01:57:43,328
Mom always said,
""Duty comes first, relations later"".

2189
01:57:43,727 --> 01:57:45,331
So, I've done my dutyâ

2190
01:57:45,395 --> 01:57:46,601
...now I'm going to save my mother.

2191
01:57:51,368 --> 01:57:52,540
Wait, Vishwas.

2192
01:57:54,171 --> 01:57:55,946
Go give them this bag.

2193
01:57:57,307 --> 01:58:01,153
Sir? - I know we lagged
in protecting your mother.

2194
01:58:01,211 --> 01:58:04,124
But now Mumbai Police
will do its best in saving her.

2195
01:58:04,181 --> 01:58:05,717
Go.
- But, sir, this bagâ

2196
01:58:05,782 --> 01:58:07,591
Trust me, we will handle everything.

2197
01:58:07,651 --> 01:58:09,153
Now go fast.

2198
01:58:12,322 --> 01:58:15,531
I kept the police
engrossed with cocaine.

2199
01:58:16,026 --> 01:58:19,303
And diverted their complete
attention on you, Gundappa.

2200
01:58:19,363 --> 01:58:24,210
And quietly,
cleverly fixed bio-chemical weaponsâ

2201
01:58:24,267 --> 01:58:26,577
...at four important
places in the city.

2202
01:58:27,471 --> 01:58:29,075
That's my real mission.

2203
01:58:29,339 --> 01:58:31,341
Mission White Elephant.

2204
01:58:32,075 --> 01:58:33,679
Bio-chemical blast!

2205
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:41,023
An RDX blast kills only those
that are in proximity.

2206
01:58:41,084 --> 01:58:44,031
But a bio-chemical blast
will also kill those

2207
01:58:44,087 --> 01:58:46,089
who are safe in their homes.

2208
01:58:46,356 --> 01:58:48,461
Because bio-chemical is a liquid.

2209
01:58:49,126 --> 01:58:51,504
It will turn into gas
right after the blast.

2210
01:58:51,561 --> 01:58:56,476
And spread a dangerous,
incurable disease through air.

2211
01:58:57,434 --> 01:58:59,038
In the entire city.

2212
01:59:15,352 --> 01:59:17,593
Your son, my enemy's here.

2213
01:59:21,792 --> 01:59:23,169
Savitri?

2214
01:59:24,261 --> 01:59:27,174
You...are still alive.

2215
01:59:28,465 --> 01:59:29,307
That means...

2216
01:59:31,835 --> 01:59:33,109
Vishwasâ

2217
01:59:35,472 --> 01:59:36,473
I...

2218
01:59:37,607 --> 01:59:39,416
I looked everywhere for you, Savitri.

2219
01:59:39,476 --> 01:59:41,422
You're dead for us.
- No.

2220
01:59:42,212 --> 01:59:43,156
No.

2221
01:59:44,247 --> 01:59:45,692
Don't say that, Savitri.

2222
01:59:46,583 --> 01:59:47,960
Look, once again we're..

2223
01:59:48,585 --> 01:59:51,589
You, me and our sonâ
- Mine.

2224
01:59:54,324 --> 01:59:56,133
Vishwas is my son.

2225
01:59:56,393 --> 01:59:57,371
Only mine.

2226
01:59:58,995 --> 02:00:01,066
You've no relation with me.

2227
02:00:01,364 --> 02:00:03,105
I do, Savitri.

2228
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:05,170
We share blood ties.

2229
02:00:06,803 --> 02:00:11,149
And even you can't change that.

2230
02:00:33,363 --> 02:00:35,434
You've the bag, Gundappa sir.

2231
02:00:36,433 --> 02:00:38,106
You can punish me in any way you want.

2232
02:00:39,035 --> 02:00:40,070
But let my mother go.

2233
02:00:40,137 --> 02:00:42,174
First let us complete our mission.

2234
02:00:42,672 --> 02:00:44,913
Mission White Elephant.

2235
02:00:46,109 --> 02:00:49,488
This bag contains
a computerized detonator.

2236
02:00:50,647 --> 02:00:53,093
Once it's connected
with our computer..

2237
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:57,095
...It will trigger numerous
blasts in the city.

2238
02:00:57,420 --> 02:00:59,593
And people will rot to death.

2239
02:01:00,157 --> 02:01:01,261
Rot to death!

2240
02:01:07,998 --> 02:01:08,499
Yes.

2241
02:01:08,565 --> 02:01:10,476
Take a left after one kilometre.

2242
02:01:29,085 --> 02:01:30,723
Take a right after three kilometres.

2243
02:01:48,004 --> 02:01:51,542
Sir. I've set the timer
for the bio-chemical weapon.

2244
02:01:51,608 --> 02:01:54,248
I've the set the timer to 20 minutes.

2245
02:01:54,311 --> 02:01:57,190
All the bombs will
explode in 20 minutes.

2246
02:02:14,998 --> 02:02:16,204
What happened to the tracker?

2247
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:18,011
Just a minute, stop!

2248
02:02:19,035 --> 02:02:20,036
You informed the police.

2249
02:02:20,103 --> 02:02:23,277
Now you and your mother
will have to die, Vishwasl

2250
02:02:24,407 --> 02:02:26,284
No one moves.

2251
02:02:26,343 --> 02:02:27,720
Or I will shoot.

2252
02:02:28,144 --> 02:02:29,452
Shoot me.

2253
02:02:31,214 --> 02:02:32,716
Don't move.

2254
02:02:32,782 --> 02:02:33,692
I said...

2255
02:02:34,484 --> 02:02:35,622
I will shoot.

2256
02:02:35,685 --> 02:02:36,993
Shoot me.

2257
02:02:38,321 --> 02:02:40,927
That's the punishment
for a sinner like me..

2258
02:02:41,958 --> 02:02:43,266
âThat I dieâ

2259
02:02:45,562 --> 02:02:47,064
...by the hands of my son.

2260
02:02:47,130 --> 02:02:48,370
What is this nonsense?

2261
02:02:48,431 --> 02:02:49,671
Fateâ

2262
02:02:51,268 --> 02:02:53,145
âhas played a joke on me, son.

2263
02:02:54,471 --> 02:02:55,449
In-

2264
02:02:57,374 --> 02:02:59,684
SavitrL.
- Don't utter my mom's name.

2265
02:03:02,112 --> 02:03:05,491
My father died when I was a kid.
- That was a charade.

2266
02:03:07,450 --> 02:03:10,226
I can't believe my eyes either.

2267
02:03:13,456 --> 02:03:14,992
After all these yearsâ

2268
02:03:18,161 --> 02:03:19,572
Ghorpade.
- Sir.

2269
02:03:20,463 --> 02:03:21,965
Switch on the monitor.

2270
02:03:23,733 --> 02:03:27,078
""You're still alive ""

2271
02:03:27,504 --> 02:03:29,006
""That means...

2272
02:03:31,541 --> 02:03:33,077
...Vishwas..""

2273
02:03:36,112 --> 02:03:38,956
""I searched...

2274
02:03:40,050 --> 02:03:41,393
...everywhere for you, Savitri.""

2275
02:03:49,092 --> 02:03:50,969
Give me a hug, son.

2276
02:03:54,431 --> 02:03:56,001
I've yearned so long for this.

2277
02:03:57,100 --> 02:03:58,477
I don't want anything else.

2278
02:03:59,502 --> 02:04:01,243
Just stop the police.

2279
02:04:02,205 --> 02:04:05,914
I will go with you
and surrender myself.

2280
02:04:06,977 --> 02:04:08,354
So that you become famous.

2281
02:04:09,012 --> 02:04:10,423
My son becomes famous.

2282
02:04:12,015 --> 02:04:13,050
That's my request.

2283
02:04:13,116 --> 02:04:13,924
That's all.

2284
02:04:17,587 --> 02:04:19,225
I want additional forces.

2285
02:04:19,289 --> 02:04:20,996
Send the backup immediately.

2286
02:04:21,558 --> 02:04:22,502
Vishwas.

2287
02:04:23,326 --> 02:04:24,498
Yes, Vishwas.

2288
02:04:26,096 --> 02:04:28,508
Sir, Napoleon's ready
to surrender. - What?

2289
02:04:30,600 --> 02:04:31,943
Stay there.

2290
02:04:33,236 --> 02:04:34,544
I'm bringing him to you.

2291
02:04:35,171 --> 02:04:36,115
OK.

2292
02:04:38,641 --> 02:04:41,178
Thank you, son.

2293
02:04:42,746 --> 02:04:46,660
L...missed you a lot, father.

2294
02:04:48,718 --> 02:04:51,198
Why did you leave me?

2295
02:04:53,256 --> 02:04:54,462
I am sorry, son.

2296
02:04:54,524 --> 02:04:57,232
I am sorry, I made a big mistake.

2297
02:04:57,293 --> 02:04:59,534
I made a big mistake.

2298
02:05:03,166 --> 02:05:05,305
Sir, you're a fantastic actor.

2299
02:05:05,368 --> 02:05:08,110
Even I was deceived for a moment.

2300
02:05:08,171 --> 02:05:09,673
Just imagine, sir. Even me.

2301
02:05:09,739 --> 02:05:11,719
Hello, Captain.
Keep the chopper ready.

2302
02:05:11,775 --> 02:05:12,719
I'm arriving in an hour.
- OK.

2303
02:05:12,776 --> 02:05:14,016
Right now.

2304
02:05:14,411 --> 02:05:15,617
Get ready to leave.
- Yes, sir.

2305
02:05:15,678 --> 02:05:17,385
Gundappa.
- I am coming.

2306
02:05:18,148 --> 02:05:19,422
In-

2307
02:05:21,484 --> 02:05:22,792
What's wrong with him?

2308
02:05:23,119 --> 02:05:25,725
Sir, there's another one there.

2309
02:05:28,725 --> 02:05:31,001
Sir, there another one.

2310
02:05:39,069 --> 02:05:40,742
Hey girl. What are you doing?

2311
02:05:41,037 --> 02:05:42,277
Nothing much.

2312
02:05:42,338 --> 02:05:44,079
I just deactivated all the bombsâ

2313
02:05:44,140 --> 02:05:46,711
...that Gundappa sir had activated.

2314
02:05:47,010 --> 02:05:49,422
That's it.
- How did she come out?

2315
02:05:50,246 --> 02:05:53,352
I brought her out, papa.
For helping me.

2316
02:05:53,416 --> 02:05:55,259
But, I..

2317
02:05:56,386 --> 02:05:57,387
Vishwas?

2318
02:05:57,454 --> 02:06:01,129
You might be my fatherâ

2319
02:06:01,191 --> 02:06:04,229
...but I'm a better actor than you.

2320
02:06:05,762 --> 02:06:08,675
You put up a charadeâ

2321
02:06:08,731 --> 02:06:12,201
...so that you can cause
blasts in the city and flee.

2322
02:06:12,268 --> 02:06:14,145
And I put up a charade, so thatâ

2323
02:06:14,204 --> 02:06:18,619
...I can stop the blasts
and apprehend everyone.

2324
02:06:20,410 --> 02:06:23,152
So, Napoleon. How was it?

2325
02:06:23,213 --> 02:06:24,658
Cool!

2326
02:06:28,151 --> 02:06:29,653
You won't survive either, son.

2327
02:06:29,719 --> 02:06:31,289
Hands up! Don't move.

2328
02:06:33,490 --> 02:06:35,333
Throw down your weapons.

2329
02:06:35,391 --> 02:06:37,132
We already did, sir.
- What?

2330
02:06:37,193 --> 02:06:39,264
You already did?
- I made them do it, sir.

2331
02:06:39,562 --> 02:06:40,472
Very good, Vishwas.

2332
02:06:40,530 --> 02:06:41,941
Very, very good.

2333
02:06:42,532 --> 02:06:44,136
Very, very bad.

2334
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:45,736
Because I still have my weapon.

2335
02:06:45,802 --> 02:06:48,180
Come on, Commissioner.
Throw down your weapon.

2336
02:06:48,805 --> 02:06:50,307
Throw it.

2337
02:06:51,741 --> 02:06:55,245
And, Vishwas. Throw down your gun too.

2338
02:06:56,613 --> 02:06:58,320
Very good, Gundappa.

2339
02:06:58,781 --> 02:07:00,089
Very good.
- You see, sir.

2340
02:07:00,150 --> 02:07:02,152
This commissioner's
always out to get me.

2341
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:31,681
Hang on.
- What happened?

2342
02:07:33,283 --> 02:07:35,229
Take this. Take this.

2343
02:08:21,264 --> 02:08:23,505
Save me!

2344
02:08:31,107 --> 02:08:33,383
Save me! Save me!

2345
02:08:33,743 --> 02:08:36,155
Save me!

2346
02:08:43,086 --> 02:08:44,690
Ghorpadel
- Yes, sir.

2347
02:08:44,754 --> 02:08:46,290
What sir?

2348
02:08:46,623 --> 02:08:48,261
You dare hit a policeman.

2349
02:08:55,431 --> 02:08:56,569
What are you doing, idiot?

2350
02:08:57,400 --> 02:08:58,640
Are you crazy?

2351
02:09:00,136 --> 02:09:01,581
What are you doing?

2352
02:09:25,628 --> 02:09:28,336
Oh my! Do you want to kill me?

2353
02:09:32,035 --> 02:09:33,241
Ghorpade.

2354
02:09:33,303 --> 02:09:34,782
Kill him.
- OK, sir.

2355
02:09:35,071 --> 02:09:36,277
Ghorpade.
- Yes, sir.

2356
02:09:36,339 --> 02:09:37,716
He's a policeman.

2357
02:09:37,774 --> 02:09:39,151
Kill him.
- Yes, sir.

2358
02:09:39,208 --> 02:09:40,448
Ghorpade.
- Yes, sir.

2359
02:09:40,510 --> 02:09:43,116
He's one of us, kill him.
- Yes, sir.

2360
02:09:43,179 --> 02:09:44,522
Ghorpade.
- Yes, sir.

2361
02:09:44,580 --> 02:09:46,719
Who do you work for?
- For you, sir.

2362
02:09:47,116 --> 02:09:48,186
Ghorpade.
- Yes, sir.

2363
02:09:48,251 --> 02:09:50,595
Who pays you?
- You do, sir.

2364
02:09:50,653 --> 02:09:52,257
Ghorpade.
- Yes, sir.

2365
02:09:52,322 --> 02:09:54,324
What uniform do you wear?
- The police uniform, sir.

2366
02:09:54,390 --> 02:09:56,370
Ghorpade.
- Yes, sir.

2367
02:09:56,426 --> 02:09:59,236
Who pays for your innerwear?
- You do, sir.

2368
02:09:59,295 --> 02:10:00,740
Ghorpade.
- Yes, sir.

2369
02:10:00,797 --> 02:10:01,741
Traitor.

2370
02:10:02,031 --> 02:10:03,237
Disloyal.

2371
02:10:03,299 --> 02:10:05,711
Double-crosser.
- Two-timer.

2372
02:10:06,436 --> 02:10:08,279
Sir, did I do the right thing?

2373
02:10:08,338 --> 02:10:10,409
Serves people like him right.

2374
02:10:10,473 --> 02:10:11,747
All the best.
- Same to you.

2375
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:13,644
No!

2376
02:11:36,259 --> 02:11:37,465
Catch him.

2377
02:11:41,631 --> 02:11:43,235
Ghorpade.
- Yes, sir.

2378
02:11:43,299 --> 02:11:44,505
Come here.

2379
02:11:45,768 --> 02:11:47,941
Where's Napoleon?

2380
02:11:59,315 --> 02:12:02,592
And this way,
Vishwas Rao has set an exampleâ

2381
02:12:03,085 --> 02:12:05,429
...by getting his father arrested.

2382
02:12:08,691 --> 02:12:10,671
And soon,
after completing his trainingâ

2383
02:12:11,227 --> 02:12:13,207
...he will join the
Mumbai Police Force. - Yes.

2384
02:12:14,230 --> 02:12:15,470
And on behalf of the governmentâ

2385
02:12:15,798 --> 02:12:18,176
âVishwas Rao will be presented
with the Bravery Award.

2386
02:12:18,434 --> 02:12:19,469
Vishwas Rao.

2387
02:13:08,384 --> 02:13:10,057
Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

2388
02:13:10,686 --> 02:13:11,687
Sir..

2389
02:13:13,189 --> 02:13:16,466
I would like my mother
to honour me with this award.

2390
02:13:17,093 --> 02:13:18,629
If you..
- Of course.

2391
02:13:18,694 --> 02:13:20,002
Call her.

2392
02:13:21,030 --> 02:13:23,374
I would like to request
Vishwas Rae's motherâ

2393
02:13:23,432 --> 02:13:26,538
...to come on stage and
honour him with this medal.

2394
02:13:37,079 --> 02:13:38,080
Mom.

2395
02:14:06,042 --> 02:14:08,249
Hello. Here.

2396
02:14:11,480 --> 02:14:16,930
""I'll tell the world everything
my mom taught me since I was a kid.""

2397
02:14:17,253 --> 02:14:22,532
""That day will surely comeu""

2398
02:14:22,792 --> 02:14:28,105
""..when you will be proud of me.""

2399
02:14:28,531 --> 02:14:33,708
""That day will surely comeu""

2400
02:14:34,136 --> 02:14:40,712
""That day will surely comeu""

2401
02:14:42,111 --> 02:14:50,053
""All I want is for you to trust me,
forever, mom.""

2402
02:14:50,419 --> 02:14:51,523
Mom.

2403
02:14:54,790 --> 02:14:56,633
My mom actually deserves this medal.

2404
02:14:58,628 --> 02:15:00,107
Today I'm standing hereâ

2405
02:15:02,198 --> 02:15:03,472
âbecause of her.

2406
02:15:06,035 --> 02:15:10,142
I always wanted to be an actor.

2407
02:15:14,510 --> 02:15:18,458
Today, my mom made
me a real-life hero.

2408
02:15:21,651 --> 02:15:23,255
It took me time to understandâ

2409
02:15:24,687 --> 02:15:26,360
âthat a real heroâ

2410
02:15:28,624 --> 02:15:30,729
âworks hard for the people.

2411
02:15:33,429 --> 02:15:37,241
Risks his life for
the safety of the people.

2412
02:15:38,834 --> 02:15:40,108
Like the police.

2413
02:15:42,104 --> 02:15:43,276
The real hero.

2414
02:15:46,108 --> 02:15:47,052
Thank you, mom.

2415
02:16:03,225 --> 02:16:04,499
Guruji, you're so late.

2416
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:06,562
The function's already over.
Look, what I got.

2417
02:16:07,496 --> 02:16:09,066
You're on a roll.

2418
02:16:09,365 --> 02:16:11,743
Look there.
Not that way, this way. Look here.

2419
02:16:12,601 --> 02:16:14,080
He's a rich producer MotwanL.

2420
02:16:14,136 --> 02:16:15,308
âAnd wants to sign you as a hero.

2421
02:16:15,371 --> 02:16:17,408
He's got cash and cheque.

2422
02:16:17,473 --> 02:16:18,747
I'm not going to
work in films anymore.

2423
02:16:20,142 --> 02:16:21,052
What are you saying?

2424
02:16:21,110 --> 02:16:22,054
Yes, Guruji.

2425
02:16:22,111 --> 02:16:23,556
Everything a hero does in filmsâ

2426
02:16:23,612 --> 02:16:25,592
...I did all that in real life.

2427
02:16:25,648 --> 02:16:27,559
Mother and son emotion.
Father and son clash.

2428
02:16:27,616 --> 02:16:29,562
Fighting the villains.
Dialogue delivery.

2429
02:16:29,618 --> 02:16:31,757
Romancing the heroine.
Dancing with the item-girl.

2430
02:16:31,821 --> 02:16:33,528
I did everything, Guruji.

2431
02:16:33,589 --> 02:16:35,125
Now I'm joining the police force.

2432
02:16:35,191 --> 02:16:37,364
Come, let's go meet mother.
- Wait a minute.

2433
02:16:37,727 --> 02:16:39,638
You and your police job.

2434
02:16:39,695 --> 02:16:41,732
Do you know what a hero
earns at the end of the day?

2435
02:16:42,098 --> 02:16:44,738
He has cars, bungalows, bank balance.

2436
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:46,746
And what is good
about your police job?

2437
02:16:47,103 --> 02:16:49,140
And what will you have in future?

2438
02:16:53,008 --> 02:16:53,486
Mom!

2439
02:16:55,244 --> 02:16:56,314
I'll have my mom!

2440
02:17:01,751 --> 02:17:04,061
Yogi bhail Yogi bhail What happened?

2441
02:17:04,754 --> 02:17:06,461
He won't work in films anymore.

2442
02:17:07,289 --> 02:17:09,394
Where are you going?
- But why?

2443
02:17:10,126 --> 02:17:11,571
Through the poster emerges the hero.'

2444
02:17:11,627 --> 02:17:13,368
Now he's a real life hero.

2445
02:17:14,196 --> 02:17:15,470
He no longer cares about the poster.

2446
02:17:15,531 --> 02:17:17,442
But, Yogi bhai, what about us now?

2447
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:19,673
What?
- What about us now?

2448
02:17:19,735 --> 02:17:20,543
Us?

We'll have to settle for one of them.

2452
02:18:05,514 --> 02:18:08,688
""The heart's brazen.""

2453
02:18:08,751 --> 02:18:12,289
""Doesn't know a thing about shame.""

2454
02:18:12,354 --> 02:18:15,494
""It's full of fun and attitude.""

2455
02:18:15,558 --> 02:18:18,767
""Can't do without flirting.""

02:18:25,734 --> 02:18:29,079
""The heart's brazen.""

2457
02:18:29,371 --> 02:18:32,318
""Doesn't know a thing about shame.""

02:18:32,708 --> 02:18:36,178
""It's full of fun and attitude.""

""Can't do without flirting.""

00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,234
Good evening India!

2
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,575
From Mumbai to Manipur...

3
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:43,705
Delhi to Dimapur...

4
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,444
roads wear a deserted look
all over the country.

5
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,383
People have taken
the day off from work.

6
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,081
Everyone has eagerly
tuned their TV sets

7
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,180
to this amazing dance show
Hum Kisise Kum Nahin!

8
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:55,522
And everyone is waiting to watch
their favourite team

9
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:58,426
from Mumbafs Nalasopara -
Mumbai Stunners!

10
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,055
Cockroach! Cockroach! Cockroach!

11
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,261
Quiet! Lizards...

12
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:10,135
I am Raghavs uncle... Raghavji.

13
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,368
He is my 'original
'full time' nephew.

14
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,706
When he was little, he used to
lie down and dance.

15
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,750
I would ask him,
'Son, what are you doing?'

16
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,644
He would say, 'Uncle, I am dancing

17
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,312
like a fish.'

18
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:24,320
'Fish dance!'

19
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,182
Vernon! What can I say about him?

20
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,521
He makes everyone laugh.

21
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,289
He says,
'anybody can deliver a pizza.'

22
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,558
'But a smile...
if you can deliver that...

23
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,462
it's an accomplishment.'

24
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,296
Vernon, keep up the good work!

25
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,131
Vernon, we love you!

26
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,261
All the best!
- Keep it up!

27
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,799
Vinnie! She is very cool...

28
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,231
Not only is her style cool...

29
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,535
she is a cool person too.

30
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:44,768
She is coming on television,
which is why

31
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,169
she hasn't come to work.

32
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,405
But her clients are
waiting only for her.

33
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,772
Suru! We call him Suru here.

34
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:50,537
It's his nickname.

35
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,105
The boys call him that.

36
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,277
So I told him that he should do

37
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,549
whatever his heart is set on.

38
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,352
'Move ahead in life.
I will support you.

39
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,723
I will give you as much money
as you want.'

40
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,013
Hey, Suru! You aren't ready as yet?

41
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,285
Pass me that.

42
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,758
Here. Now hurry up.

43
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,160
And is there anything to eat?
I am starving.

44
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,459
Yes, there is an apple inside.

45
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,158
Has everyone reached?

46
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,223
Everyone is there.

47
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,393
What!

48
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:47,301
Vinnie is waiting for you downstairs.
Get dressed quickly.

49
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,430
Hey!

50
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,635
Before we begin the biggest
dance celebration...

51
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,337
Let me introduce ourjudges.

52
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,606
Ladies and gentlemen!

53
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:56,806
Please welcome...

54
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,674
Mrs. Sita Devi ji...

56
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,077
And Remo D'Souza!

57
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,662
Welcome to the biggest
dance show in India

58
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,198
<i>'Adkzfion Dee' presents...</i>

59
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:19,067
'Hum Kisise Kum Nahin'

60
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:23,005
That is being watched since 12 weeks
in 180 countries by millions.

61
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,666
Let's start this programme

62
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,439
with a breathtaking and
mind blowing performance...

63
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,502
from Team Illuminati

64
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,570
And the next group <i>is...</i>

65
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,172
J5!

66
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,025
Where were you guys!

67
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,116
Sorry... Come on boys!

68
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,559
We have to win this!

69
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,064
Let's go for it!!

70
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,496
We have a team here...

71
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,500
and every time they
performs on this stage...

72
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:15,096
they makes us realize that Indian
dancers are no less than anyone!

73
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:20,008
- And we have here your favourite team
- Mumbai Stunners!

74
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:19,588
- Wow! What a performancel!

75
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:22,258
- The audience has already given
them a standing ovation.

76
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,164
- But, let's see
what the judges have to say.

77
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:27,329
- So, let's hear it for
Mumbai Stunners.

78
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:34,201
Yes. The audience has given you
a standing ovation

79
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,341
- Yes, absolutely!

80
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,439
But for this amazing act...

81
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,345
I have to congratulate...

82
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,147
that awesome team whose name is...

83
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,815
Philippine All Stars!

84
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:51,452
Why Suresh,
will you say it or should I?

85
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,627
I think I will say it.

86
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:58,495
This entire act, its every step...

87
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:03,003
from the formation to the flip...

88
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,331
has been copied!

89
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,372
What do you have to say, Suresh?

90
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,136
No, sir. We have not copied the act.

91
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,009
Shut up!

92
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,580
Not just copy, but your team
has also cheated.

93
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:16,552
You have written that the act is
choreographed by Suresh and Vernon.

94
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,746
But it's not even your choreography!

95
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,288
The problem with people like you
is that you pick someone else's ideas

96
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,555
and creativity from the internet...

97
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,221
copy it and perform the act on stage.

98
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,764
And the poor souls who do not know...

99
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,260
that you have copied the act...

100
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,359
applaud and vote for you.
Correct?

101
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,127
Very sad!

102
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:39,301
- Suresh, aren't you
Padmashri DurgadevFs son?

103
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,334
Yes, madam.

104
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:45,473
- Whether anyone else
knows this or not...

105
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:53,389
but we believe that you understand
very clearly that dance is no joke.

106
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:57,127
It is worship. It is a discipline...

107
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,224
A discipline your mother lived by.

108
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:05,298
I cannot believe that you
can do something like this.

109
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:13,037
Your mother, who died with
her anklets on...

110
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,175
for whom dance was everything.

111
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,711
Shame on you!

112
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:25,179
I think you cannot continue
in the competition.

113
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,715
You guys can leave.
- Tell them we didn't cheat.

114
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,758
Sir!

115
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:32,587
Think original next time.
You may go.

116
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,122
Suru...

117
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:43,232
In summery breeze, flows the colour

118
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:48,040
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

119
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:53,746
In summery breeze, flows the colour

120
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:58,721
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

121
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,691
The colour of your tradition

122
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:04,421
The colour of your love

123
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:09,728
It has brought the
colour of your success

124
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,526
The colour of your tradition

125
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:15,162
The colour of your love

126
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:20,404
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

127
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,507
<i>'</i> Hi!

128
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,580
Hi! Vinnie, I need a new haircut.
Will you manage a Katrina Kaif?

129
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,674
An exact copy.

130
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,784
Who am I asking?

131
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,380
You are an expert at copying,
isn't it?

132
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:37,086
Oh Mother...

133
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,798
My Mother...

134
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:50,700
Did your father build this place
so that you could dance?

135
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:52,398
Enough!

136
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,738
No more dancing from today.

137
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,772
From now on, you will
concentrate on work.

138
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,515
We've had to face the music as well.

139
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,573
What happened?
- We are also answerable to our families...

140
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,174
What's wrong?

141
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,617
I won't be a part
of this group anymore!

142
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,619
Tell me, what happened?

143
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:04,644
What is it?

144
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,586
No more, Suru.
I'm sorry...

145
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,123
Why don't you tell us what happened?

146
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,453
Why are you going out?

147
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,254
Where are you going?

148
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,517
What's the problem, boys?

149
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,265
- Pizza, sir.

150
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,735
Good evening, sir.
- Good evening...

151
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,230
Ah, so the pizza is free today?

152
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,603
Why would it be free, sir?

153
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,641
Because it's late.

154
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,703
No sir, it's just 25 minutes
by my watch.

155
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:29,745
Really?

156
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,744
But according to my watch
it's 35 minutes.

157
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,082
But sir, the delivery time...

158
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:35,743
This is wrong, sir.

159
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,715
Yes, yes! Go.

160
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,717
Sir, this is cheating.

161
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:43,089
And now you will teach me
what cheating is!

162
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,688
You guys are the biggest cheaters.

163
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:49,156
Listen, I will order pizza everyday.

164
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:52,530
And if YOU deliver it...
I will not pay a penny. Got it?

165
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,593
You can do whatever you want.
Get out.

166
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,568
Cheaters!

167
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,640
- Did you deliver late again?

168
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:58,436
Sorry, sir.

169
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,977
I explained it to you earlier.
What do you mean by sorry?

170
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,338
Does money grow on trees? Does it?
- No, sir.

171
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,149
- This is a last warning.

172
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,482
- Next time I will cut it
from your salary.

173
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,512
Oh Mother

174
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,525
Dear Mother

175
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,617
Hey, cheater.

176
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,356
Sorry... waiter!
Come here.

177
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,259
Vinnie, it's your client.

178
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,426
Come in.
- Coming.

179
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,169
My shadow dithers away from me

180
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,468
Please get me another one.
- Okay.

181
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:31,503
Go!

182
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:42,415
My shadow is your illusion

183
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:47,321
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

184
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:53,163
In summery breeze, flows the colour

185
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:58,395
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

186
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,097
The colour of your tradition

187
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,606
The colour of your love

188
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:09,135
It has brought the
colour of your success

189
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,738
The colour of your tradition

190
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,450
The colour of your love

191
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:19,251
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

192
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:26,221
In summery breeze, flows the colour
Fluttering in your warmth and affection

193
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,232
""This entire act, its every step...""

194
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:32,127
""from the formation to the flip...""

195
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,367
""has been copied!""

196
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:39,603
""- Your mother, who died with
her anklets on...""

197
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,545
""for whom dance was everything.
Shame on you!""

198
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:55,348
I have shamed you

199
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:58,452
I agree I have tarnished
your reputation

200
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,519
Mother

201
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,130
My mother

202
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,238
I have shamed you

203
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,669
Mother

204
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,278
My mother

205
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,754
You are in my soul,
In my every word

206
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,688
My stubbornness, my life

207
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,627
You are my deepest pain,
My ultimate consequence

208
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:36,029
You are my holy recitation

209
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,275
You are in my soul,
In my every word

210
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,241
My stubbornness, my life

211
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,176
You are my deepest pain,
My ultimate consequence

212
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,111
You are my holy recitation

213
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,013
You are in my prayer,
You are my hope

214
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,018
You are my path

215
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,678
You are my honour,
The blood in my veins

216
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,245
You are my all, my life

217
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:04,192
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

218
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:12,264
In summery breeze, flows the colour

219
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:17,171
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

220
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,689
Thank you!
Welcome to Comedy Nights.

221
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,158
Let me tell you...

222
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,025
if cheating was
included in the Olympics

223
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,394
Mumbai Stunners would surely win Gold.

224
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,761
Bigger cheaters than us!

225
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,194
I gave him an 80-rupee note
and requested for change.

226
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,668
He gave me two 40-rupee notes.

227
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:53,367
Stop! Senses transformed
Sights varied

228
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,106
And the boat changed
Altering the coast.

229
00:18:56,335 --> 00:19:00,374
If you want to change this world,
You need to change your perspective.

230
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:06,151
What you want is neither
in your retreat Nor in your e><ile.

231
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:10,387
Introspect.
Everything is in your belief.

232
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:19,628
A stone faced hardship
And shattered to pebbles.

233
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:24,299
While another stone bore adversity
To become the seat of the Lord.

234
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,049
Hello Vinnie...

235
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:34,982
Suru.

236
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,143
Let's prepare a super performance.

237
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,712
We will rock the stage ne><t year.
Why are you worrying?

238
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:43,050
Next year is very far.
I have a solution right now.

239
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:43,684
What is it?

240
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,165
What is this?

241
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:52,327
The biggest hip-hop competition
is going to be held in Vegas.

242
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,600
You mean in America?
l-low will we go there'?

243
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,268
What did the judges say?

244
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,204
That we copied those guys!

245
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,335
I say let's go there and
take them head on.

246
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,674
- What rubbish!

247
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,077
We haven't managed
to do anything here.

248
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,615
What can we achieve there?

249
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,416
Suru is fully prepared.

250
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,777
The competition is in three months.

251
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,723
We will start a new team.

252
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,186
India's first dance team.

253
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,485
What are you saying, Suru!

254
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,495
In three months! Are you crazy?

255
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,689
You are being unrealistic!

256
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:23,596
In three months we'll make a team...
Go to America...

257
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:28,729
Look, if you guys support me...
I am sure we can get there.

258
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,101
And if you don't support me...

259
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,771
I will take some time
but I will surely make a team.

260
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,316
Let's go.

261
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:50,811
Vishnu! Vishnu! Vishnu!...

262
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,614
Get lost, you fool!

263
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,486
Dude, who are you?

264
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:21,546
Idiot!

265
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,021
He is asking me who I am?

266
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,762
Should I tell him or show him?

267
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,259
Show him!

268
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:14,408
I have spent
The whole day waiting

269
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:19,711
Every happiness is borrowed

270
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:24,780
Even my sorrows
Are one on one free

271
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:29,783
I was here yesterday
Am here today too

272
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:35,054
And will meet you tomorrow, too
Right here

273
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:41,035
O O O At happy hour!

274
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:45,538
O O O At happy hour!

275
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:51,275
All the worries will drown
In the first go!

276
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:55,751
O O O At happy hour!

277
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,551
O O O At happy hour!

278
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,144
The heart jumps with Joy!

279
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,683
The glass is empty
Pour!

280
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:34,755
The heart is stubborn

281
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,289
It doesn't listen to me

282
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,761
No boundaries to its stubbornness

283
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:42,692
It doesn't listen to me

284
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,529
There is no one like me

285
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,762
There's one and only me!

286
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:52,264
There is a lightening in my veins

287
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:57,173
Like a current passes through wire

288
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:03,416
One, two, three, four
At happy hour!

289
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:08,055
O O O At happy hour!

290
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:13,628
All the worries will drown
In the first go!

291
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:18,566
O O O At happy hour!

292
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,268
O O O At happy hour!

293
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:43,582
Bring out the naughtiness
Knock on the locks and doors

294
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:47,721
You are a bird, but break the cage
With the fury of your wings.

295
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:51,324
Smashed your slippers on the rug
The needle was lost in the haystack

296
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:54,495
But why did you run?
Don't let fear hold you!

297
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,735
O Mr. Naidu!
The Lord is inside you!

298
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,401
Be thick-skinned
Live life on the rocks

299
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,378
Gulp down La-la-life!

300
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:06,175
O O O At happy hour!

301
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:10,013
O O O At happy hour!

302
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,721
Sir!

303
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,161
This is the last one. Please.

304
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,298
Sir, you are superb!

305
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,464
Outstanding! Hats off to you, sir!

306
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,405
I know, man.
Shut up and get lost!

307
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:33,771
Sorry, sir.

308
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:36,668
Here, hold this.

309
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:37,770
Wait and watch...

310
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:40,282
One day we will go to America

311
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:42,147
for the hip-hop competition

312
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,014
and people like him will salute us.

313
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:46,020
What will they do?

314
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,051
Salute.

315
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,523
I know, man. Get lost.

316
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,256
Don't ever meet me again.

317
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,521
Go away, hippopotamus.

318
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,293
- All my money is over.

319
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:57,128
Sir, excuse me...

320
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:58,462
Excuse me.

321
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,560
I have won the bottle.
I don't want a bill.

322
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,002
Yes, you have won the bottle.

323
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,370
Yes, so let me drink.

324
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:05,635
Yes, sir. Drink up.

325
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:08,234
But you mentioned
the hip-hop competition in America.

326
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,507
Ah, yes. In Las Vegas.

327
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,009
Yes, sir.

328
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,982
Have you gone there?

329
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:15,741
I wanted to.

330
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,420
But right now I will go home.

331
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,992
I can drop you.
I have a bike.

332
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,496
Take me.

333
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:30,658
Yes, sir.

334
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:32,631
Take me.

335
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:44,313
By the way, sir, we've met
like in the movies.

336
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,244
I mean you dance like Michael Jackson

337
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,148
and have adopted
Indian superstar Rajni's style.

338
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:50,117
Do you agree'?

339
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,245
Left.

340
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:57,152
I didn't tell you earlier
but I have an entire team ready.

341
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:58,360
Right.

342
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:01,363
Right from here?
Actually, sir, even I am a dancer.

343
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:04,366
You may have seen me on television.
Do you watch television, sir?

344
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:05,560
Left.
- You left TV?

345
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,571
Anyway, I really feel
that we met by fate.

346
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:13,667
I mean, we needed a choreographer
and you, a team. You know like...

347
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:15,142
Right.

348
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,310
Okay, sir.

349
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,247
Yes, sir. I was saying...
will you teach us, sir?

350
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,078
Right.

351
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,173
Yes, sir, right.

352
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:24,186
So, will you take us to Vegas?
Tell me, sir.

353
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:25,482
Stop.

354
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,453
Sir. Vegas.

355
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,524
Vishnu sir! Vishnu sir...

356
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,397
At happy hour...

357
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:38,632
l-low was my dance'?

358
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,668
Sir, superb!

359
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,067
I know, man. Shut up!

360
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,097
He must be sleeping, isn't it?

361
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:48,738
Try again.

362
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,740
L-low can you trust someone
when they are drunk'?

363
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:54,611
L-low do you know
if he was saying the truth'?

364
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,346
He knows.

365
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,513
He said that this is an annual
international event since years

366
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:01,352
Suru, it has been years
since we have been knocking.

367
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:02,517
When will he open the door?

368
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,957
Shut up!

369
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,628
It is the door of fortune.
It will not open easily.

370
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,565
This door isn't leading to luck,
but a tippler.

371
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,503
- Hey, the door opened!

372
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,201
Come... come...
Be careful... inside.

373
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:20,398
Sir.

374
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:21,273
Sir?

375
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,170
Come... come...

376
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:26,112
Sir?

377
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,479
Vishnu sir.
- Vernon, check these sticky notes.

378
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:34,516
OMG!
- Not notes, but a whole project.

379
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,422
International hip-hop competition.

380
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,687
Whoa!

381
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:42,391
He's mapped out everything
about the competition.

382
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,093
Looks like he's all set to conquer...

383
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:49,566
The entire mission is ready.

384
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:52,574
From travel details
to the hotel rental.

385
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:57,377
I told you. He may be a loony tippler
but he is everyone's guru.

386
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:59,540
But where is this guru?

387
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:01,283
Quiet.

388
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:03,417
Come on.

389
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:05,320
Come on.

390
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:11,720
Vishnu sir.

391
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,519
Sir. Sir.

392
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:15,729
Shake him.

393
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:16,455
Sir.

394
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:18,723
Who is it?

395
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:19,968
Hi, sir.

396
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,169
Who are you, man?

397
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:26,636
Sir, this is Vernon, Raghav, Jack...
I am Vinnie and he's Suresh.

398
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:29,975
Sir, you were tipsy last night.
Then I paid your bill.

399
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:32,514
Then on the bike -
right, left, right, left...

400
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:35,113
Stop.
- Yes, you told me to stop like that.

401
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:36,117
Have you come here to get the money?

402
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,175
Sir, not money.

403
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:40,018
You spoke about the international
hip-hop competition.

404
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,225
Sir, you told me you would show me
the road to Vegas.

405
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:48,494
The road to Vegas!

406
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,000
Get out of here, go straight,
then take a left.

407
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:53,160
Take a taxi from the main road
to the airport.

408
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,531
Go... get lost!

409
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,695
What do you mean?

410
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,761
Get lost!

411
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,633
Sir, you promised.

412
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:03,668
Sir, you said that you need a group
and that group is here today.

413
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,237
I swear he said it.

414
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,407
Suru!

415
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,711
Vinnie, say something.

416
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:14,714
Sir, we all need a choreographer...
a mentor like you.

417
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:16,448
Sir, please.

418
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,320
I told you to leave.

419
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,421
Forget being a mentor.
Look at the bottle he's picked up.

420
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,023
I do not want a team.
- Sir!

421
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:24,725
Sir!

422
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,766
Sir, you are kidding, aren't you?
- Maybe.

423
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,044
Look at my face...

424
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:38,703
Bubbles!

425
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,610
Do you think I'm joking?

426
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:48,253
No more teaching...

427
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,792
Sir, have you stopped teaching dance?

428
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,554
Sir, didn't you mention
the other day...

429
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,655
Sir?

430
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,726
You had prepared for the competition.

431
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,505
And that you didn't have a team

432
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,303
You wanted to go to Vegas.

433
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,603
Are you crazy?

434
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:20,082
Whatever you may say...
he's a genius.

435
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:23,321
Did you see that board?
He is completely prepared.

436
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:27,360
Suru, is this tippler
a dancer as well?

437
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,098
Dancer?

438
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:31,030
He's the king of dancers.

439
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,091
He is excellent.

440
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,094
I cannot tell you...

441
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,430
He's outstanding...

442
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:38,735
I mean... he's... he's just...

443
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,676
He's praising someone else
for the first time!

444
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:43,476
This is unbelievable.

445
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:46,447
It will be unbelievable when our feet
dance to his steps.

446
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,484
If anyone can get
back our lost honour...

447
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,446
it is Vishnu sir!

448
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:54,046
What sort of a loony guy is he?
He drinks shampoo.

449
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,484
He must be downing conditioner.

450
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,454
And honour...
We will get it back when he agrees.

451
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:00,292
He will agree.
Leave that to me.

452
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:01,261
Done.

453
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:04,760
Suru...
- Yes?

454
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,300
Listen...

455
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,029
You always make some grand plan,

456
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,373
everyone gets excited and
leave their work and come to you.

457
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,137
But you...
- But what, Vinnie?

458
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,480
I am scared.

459
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,014
What if there is a problem
like the last time?

460
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,110
There won't be.

461
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,585
Do you trust me?

462
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,314
Do you?

463
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:30,648
Obviously.

464
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:32,194
- Come on guys...

465
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:40,091
Are you angry?
- Yes, sir.

466
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,781
L-low was my dance that clay'?

467
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:54,482
Sir, superb.

468
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,382
Shut up! I know, man.

469
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:59,183
Sir. Have it.

470
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,764
Sir, Vegas. Come on, sir.
Please.

471
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,697
What kind of guy is this?

472
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,629
What are you doing?

473
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:15,693
Oh, no!

474
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,239
What are you doing? No!

475
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:18,763
No... no!

476
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,273
Sir, the pizza is free.
- Get lost.

477
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,685
Wow! Wow! Wow!

478
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:40,284
Turn now.

479
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:53,064
What are you doing, sir?

480
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:55,441
I'm trying to ride the bike.
Sir, please.

481
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:07,580
""Get us a beverage.""

482
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:09,082
Sir.

483
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,319
Please give us one chance.
We have a good team.

484
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,291
No chance!

485
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,293
Please agree, sir.

486
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,455
Sir, we want to represent India.
Give us one chance.

487
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:15,190
- Get lost!

488
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,493
Sir, Vegas.
- Get lost!

489
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,556
We love dancing. Please sir...
give us one chance.

490
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,000
- Get lost!

491
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,329
Sir, I have a plan.

492
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,303
I have told you so many times.

493
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,568
I can't teach you to dance. Get lost!

494
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,010
You okay?

495
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,148
Sir, what is this?

496
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,583
We are pleading so much.

497
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:41,217
Can you not see our hard work?

498
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:44,725
Can't you see Suru's efforts?

499
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:47,285
Vinnie, let's go.
- No please let me...

500
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,359
Suru has only one dream...

501
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:54,133
And he is waiting for the moment
you will agree.

502
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:56,796
And you are pushing him away?

503
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,300
Why are you behaving this way, sir?
Vvhy?

504
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,611
Because you are all cheaters.

505
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,412
All of you.

506
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:11,578
You stole the Philippine All Stars'
entire routine...

507
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:14,418
in Hum Kisi Se Kam Nahin.

508
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,480
Step by step!

509
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:17,350
The entire country saw it.

510
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,656
I recognized you immediately.

511
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,062
I didn't tell you though. Out!

512
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:31,200
Come on boys.

513
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:34,543
Sir, the world gave up on us...

514
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,273
but I thought you would
give us a chance.

515
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,375
Fine. We are cheaters.

516
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,419
But do you know who
the biggest cheater is here?

517
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:47,187
Sir, it is you.

518
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,583
We are only tricking the world.

519
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,585
But you are cheating yourself.

520
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:56,755
Your entire wall is covered
with these posters...

521
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:59,199
Have your dreams come true yet?

522
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:04,266
I thought that like us...
you too love dance.

523
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:05,974
But you are only...

524
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,235
Come on. Let's go.

525
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,037
It is not so easy to go to Vegas.

526
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:13,278
First, there will be
auditions in Bangalore.

527
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,680
Sir, we know the details.

528
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,111
The travel,
food and competition fee...

529
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,583
adds up to about
24-25 thousand rupees...

530
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,124
Sir, everything is arranged for.

531
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,450
Even the team is very good.
At least check us out once.

532
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,425
24, 25 thousand rupees
will not suffice.

533
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:28,395
Do you know the cost
of going to Vegas?

534
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,599
Twenty two lakhs sixty thousand.

535
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,695
Sir, if we win the
Bangalore competition...

536
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:36,533
even that amount will be arranged.

537
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,496
My boss, Shetty Anna...

538
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:39,735
who owns Desi Cocktail Bar...

539
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:42,166
will sponsor us.

540
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:43,405
He promised us.
- Yes, sir.

541
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:44,468
Please sir.
- Please.

542
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:46,206
Only you need to agree.

543
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:49,449
Say yes, sir...

544
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:50,779
Say yes...

545
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:54,551
Sir... sir...

546
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,024
- Please sir.

547
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,422
Yes!

548
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:05,393
Move aside. Our guru has come!

549
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,569
- Chotu get us tea.
- On Raghavs account.

550
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,318
WOW !

551
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:27,012
You guys practice here?

552
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,217
Yes, sir. Since we were kids.

553
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:31,683
It's Crocks' place.

554
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,594
Half Of it.

555
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:35,296
Half?

556
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,726
Father and uncle were partners.

557
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:42,033
After father's death,
I became the owner.

558
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:45,207
Crocks has cut a super deal
with his uncle.

559
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,606
Uncle continues his business outside

560
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,234
while we rehearse here every day.

561
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:49,607
Sir, my deal.

562
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:50,668
Yes. His deal.

563
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:53,579
Alright. Call the rest.

564
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,376
Sir...uh...

565
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,448
Sir... We are only so many.

566
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,251
Sir... Please sit.

567
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:09,361
The championships main event
is the group event.

568
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,295
Our team is small.

569
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,493
It's not enough.

570
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,436
We will need more people.

571
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,233
Sir... don't even go there.

572
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,104
We have been completely defamed.

573
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,274
Sir, after the HK2N competition we...

574
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,441
Sir... It is because of him...
that half of them left...

575
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:24,639
Because of me...

576
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:25,976
Guys!

577
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:26,981
Quiet...

578
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:27,709
Guys, please stop it!

579
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,517
Please.
- Sorry, sir.

580
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:31,246
We don't need a fight.

581
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:33,488
We need a solution to this problem.

582
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,150
Tell me one by one.

583
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,120
The one holding the flag will talk.

584
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,189
Right, sir.
- Talk.

585
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,590
The old dancers will not come back

586
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:46,728
so we will need new dancers.

587
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,061
- And sir, there is one...

588
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:50,232
He has the flag.

589
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:53,065
We will have to hold an audition
for new dancers.

590
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,337
And for that we will have to
post it to Facebook.

591
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:56,275
And also make posters.

592
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,404
And, Orkut.

593
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,114
Sir, I know Bhogi.

594
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,080
Mag-

595
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,045
Oh, sorry. I know Bhogi.

596
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:04,279
He is the best guy for posters.
- I have...

597
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,253
The posters won't be a concern.

598
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,713
You have a lot to say, buddy. Talk.

599
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,016
And, sir...

600
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,420
Yes, talk.
- Talk.

601
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:14,621
Victory to India, sir.

602
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,290
Sir, he's weird like this.

603
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,129
Sorry, sir...

604
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,193
Sorry, sir...

605
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:22,562
What's up boys?

606
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,104
Suru, sit.

607
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,636
Listen up. I am starting a new team

608
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:28,975
for the international
hip-hop challenge.

609
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,001
That means a team for India.
Our team!

610
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,645
I have reserved a spot for you guys.

611
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,515
Come on, boys. Let's go.

612
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:35,516
Yes.

613
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,520
Take him. He anyway loves to cheat.

614
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,556
International !!

615
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,429
Bhogi's poster isn't working.

616
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:01,333
I don't think anyone
else is going to come.

617
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:02,735
He's going to drive us nuts.

618
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:03,994
The poster is jinxed.

619
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:04,766
Brothers...

620
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:05,769
- Hey... sorry!

621
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,473
Hey!

622
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:08,236
- Where do you think you are going?

623
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,575
Is the audition happening here?
- Yes...

624
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,738
And who are you?

625
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,573
From Baroda to Naroda,
I'm very famous.

626
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:15,743
- Here's another weirdo.

627
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,514
'D' stands for Dharmesh.

628
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:20,451
Sir. Vishnu sir. l-low are you'?

629
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,012
Alright.

630
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,025
I saw on Facebook that sir is

631
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,618
putting together a new team...

632
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:26,388
Which is why I am here.

633
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,556
Do you know Vishnu sir?

634
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,791
Of course.

635
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:33,334
He danced so well in Baroda.

636
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,596
That's when I started dancing.

637
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,035
Show us your moves.

638
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:37,401
Let me tell you.

639
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:38,599
My father is in the police force.

640
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:39,640
He asked me to join the police.

641
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:40,698
$0, go join!

642
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,711
I don't know anything
else besides dance.

643
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:46,347
So, I am here. As a patriot.

644
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:47,711
Hey, patriot.

645
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,648
Will keep talking
or show us your moves?

646
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,345
I will. I am here for that.

647
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:52,216
Madam.

648
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,256
- She'll come.
- Hurry up.

649
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:55,313
Come on! Hit it!

650
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,060
Oh! Goggles.

651
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:22,143
Superb!

652
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:25,641
Thanks guys.
- It was superb buddy!

653
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,614
What a mind blowing performance.

654
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,585
He is a very good dancer.

655
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:32,679
He will add to the group, sir.

656
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:35,019
Sir. He is too good.
- Yes, sir!

657
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:36,656
Sir.

658
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,023
Good dancer!
- Thank you, sir.

659
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,495
We need more like him.

660
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,156
Do you need another dancer?

661
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:44,632
Yes
- I have a fantastic dancer.

662
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:46,065
I will bring him if you say so.

663
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:48,161
Yes of course.

664
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,199
Yes.

665
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:51,535
Sir, am I in the team?

666
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:05,382
Isn't this a great place, Vinod?

667
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:07,712
What's up, D?

668
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,049
Sir, this is Vinod.

669
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,593
He's the other dancer
that I mentioned.

670
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,559
He's the guy.

671
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,553
Hi, Vinod. lam Vishnu.

672
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:15,756
Sir, he is mute and hearing impaired.
- Hi!

673
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,397
What?

674
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:20,001
D, what are you saying?

675
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:21,297
Yes... it's true.

676
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:22,268
Sir, he is mute and hearing impaired.

677
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,135
In our words,
he doesn't speaker nor a mike.

678
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:27,368
If he cannot hear...
how will he dance to the beat'?

679
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:28,273
One chance.

680
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,403
Sorry, but we need a dancer.

681
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:32,036
All this will not do.

682
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:33,638
Sir, just watch him once.

683
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,047
He will manage.

684
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:41,421
Sir, he is saying
that he wants to dance.

685
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:44,420
I can dance...

686
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:48,223
...so what if I cannot hear the music.

687
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:49,790
But, sir.

688
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,393
He says that he can...

689
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:56,632
feel the music.

690
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:00,106
If you can...

691
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:03,510
feel the music...

692
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,411
then...

693
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:13,321
Any Body Can Dance.

694
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,627
- Sir, he's very good.
- We could take him.

695
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:10,638
- We maybe be in trouble if we take him.
- Boys!

696
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,632
Are you still discussing Vinod?

697
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:15,699
He dances better than all of us.

698
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:16,376
Yes.

699
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:17,673
We will have to take him, sir.
What say?

700
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,338
We will have to take him.

701
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:21,349
Guys! Don't mind but he is
like a live version of a silent film.

702
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:22,406
He is a film without a soundtrack.

703
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:23,644
L-low long will we tolerate it'?

704
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:26,017
Look, it is fine till this point.

705
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:27,647
If anything gets messed up
in the big competition...

706
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:30,385
then he will not
take any responsibility.

707
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:31,152
What will we do then?

708
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:32,489
Why are you being negative?
- Why are you saying that?

709
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:33,653
Then who will take responsibility?

710
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:34,457
I Will.

711
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,429
In that case so will I.

712
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:37,193
Me, too.

713
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:37,665
I am in, boss.

714
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:38,597
That's it, Jacky boy.

715
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,191
Sir, give us your final decision.

716
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:41,628
- He is already in.

717
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,432
<i>Yaw.!</i>

718
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,072
five... six... seven... eight.

719
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:49,735
One... two...

720
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,774
three... four...

721
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,342
five... six... seven... eight.

722
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:54,211
- What were you saying?
- This one...

723
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:57,514
- Vernon, let's try that step.
- No, this one.

724
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:58,712
- Is this the one?

725
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,585
Is there place in the team?

726
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:10,424
There was always place for you guys.

727
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,460
- It's good you guys are back.

728
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:17,604
Thank you, lord!

729
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:00,609
Get me the deodorant.

730
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,551
Get him out of here.

731
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:08,052
What's wrong?
- What a shameless guy!

732
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:10,118
Well done, boys!

733
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,454
Sir, let's do it once more.

734
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:12,289
Take rest.

735
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:13,350
Sir, please...

736
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:14,259
Hey, Vinnie!

737
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:15,956
Come on guys...

738
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:19,029
Once more...
- No more... enough...

739
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,298
- What's wrong with you guys?

740
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:26,699
Sit.

741
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:28,065
I'm not coming.

742
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,235
L-low much will we practice'?
- Relax.

743
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,006
Come.
Or I'm going to dance on my own.

744
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:32,672
You go dance with her.

745
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:34,543
Go on.

746
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:46,160
Listen, my love

747
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:53,658
Pour the ink of love on me

748
00:49:57,361 --> 00:50:03,505
I will take on the colour

749
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:08,115
I will rain on you

750
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:14,587
I am only yours

751
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:20,128
Your touch makes me come alive

752
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:24,689
Come alive

753
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,351
Superb!
- It's not over yet.

754
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:55,522
Wait!

755
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,530
I'm not practicing...
- You are going nowhere!

756
00:50:58,789 --> 00:50:59,790
Hold on, D.

757
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,468
Suru, watch this.

758
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:06,335
I am like sand

759
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:09,570
You are the source for water

760
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:16,676
You complete me

761
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:19,518
I am like sand

762
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:23,752
You are the source for water

763
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:29,293
You complete me

764
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:37,165
I will cross the ocean

765
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:40,265
With this love of yours

766
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:44,107
I will blossom

767
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:48,513
I am only yours

768
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:53,316
Your touch makes me come alive

769
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:57,722
Come alive

770
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:06,297
Listen, my love

771
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:13,774
Pour the ink of love on me

772
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:21,744
The Bangalore audition money?

773
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,251
Wait. I will also give you.

774
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:28,550
Vvhy?

775
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,753
You have my share?
Who gave it to you?

776
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:37,524
Boyfriend?

777
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,432
Who is my boyfriend?

778
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:46,733
Suru?

779
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,776
Who told you?

780
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:55,649
I am mute and hearing impaired.
lam not blind.

781
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,347
You are seeing a bit too much.

782
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:02,155
Five... six... seven... eight...

783
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,454
Turn around!

784
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:14,602
There are just two more days
to the Bangalore Competition.

785
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:16,035
Come on.

786
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,198
Vinnie, you go!

787
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:22,470
Strong... hold firm!

788
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,606
Back straight.

789
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:27,004
Suru, follow me.

790
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:33,611
Well done, boys!

791
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:37,156
Keep it strong.
It's becoming loose.

792
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,521
Five... six... seven... eight...

793
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,790
Is this what you are going
to do at the competition?

794
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:52,665
Make some space for me.

795
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:57,509
We don't dance this much
in my hometown.

796
00:53:57,667 --> 00:53:59,305
We danced a lot.
Pass the water.

797
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:05,008
Where's the deodorant?

798
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:17,389
Why don't you wash your socks?

799
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:24,263
What happened?

800
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:37,113
- Hey listen, everyone is waiting.

801
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:39,244
- Why are you standing alone
and getting sentimental?

802
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,688
- What are you thinking about?

803
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:45,090
- I'm thinking about
the Bangalore competition.

804
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:46,685
- Who knows what will happen tomorrow.

805
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:54,258
Once more... once more.

806
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:58,598
Come on, boys.

807
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,171
The ne><t round, D-Maniacs...

808
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:11,675
Look at them... cheaters!
Wonder who they will copy ne><t.

809
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:15,684
We just have a small problem.
I'll be back.

810
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:23,422
Excuse me, guys.

811
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,429
Suresh...

812
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:27,998
Yes?

813
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,731
Mumbai Stunners!
- Yes.

814
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,470
You are quite famous.

815
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:33,639
Take your group and go back.

816
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:34,539
You guys are disqualified.

817
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:36,042
Why are we disqualified, sir?
- Excuse me!

818
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:37,238
Disqualified?

819
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,471
Even before the performance?
On what grounds?

820
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:42,606
The organisers can disqualify any team
before their performance.

821
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:45,050
Yes. But there should be
a valid reason.

822
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,211
Who are you?

823
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:49,655
Vishnu.

824
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,021
Mr. Vishnu...

825
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:54,084
This is not a reality show for TRPs.

826
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:57,392
This is a serious,
very serious dance competition.

827
00:55:58,154 --> 00:56:00,600
The audience here has some of
India's best hip-hop dancers...

828
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:02,659
who do not want to see your team.

829
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:07,031
The team that wins here
will represent India in Vegas.

830
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:09,569
And cheaters can't represent India.

831
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:10,508
Sir, we are not cheaters...

832
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,535
We will refund your entry fee.
You guys can leave.

833
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:15,640
Sir, give us one chance.
Please!

834
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,215
Vishnu sir...
- Please tell them.

835
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:24,189
Nothing's wrong.

836
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:30,185
The team that wins today
will go to Vegas!

837
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:32,385
The teams that made
it to the finals are...

838
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:35,328
Desi Tigers, Dancing Parrots,

839
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:36,622
Ulvlaniac...

840
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:38,088
Red Hustle...

841
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:39,758
and Frequency.

842
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:42,264
Now let's get them on stage.

843
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:48,100
Cheaters! Cheaters! Cheaters!

844
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:51,173
Excuse me. Please.

845
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:54,143
Give us a minute.
Just one minute, please.

846
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:56,243
I am Vishnu.

847
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:59,109
I have got a team here from Mumbai.

848
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:00,119
Whose name is...

849
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:02,247
- Cheaters!

850
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,088
- Cheaters, go home!

851
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:07,960
Yes.

852
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:11,256
You were saying this outside as well.

853
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,391
You are right.

854
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:15,433
I am happy that the audience...

855
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:20,033
sitting here is honest.

856
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:22,708
Yes, some of the dancers in our team

857
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:24,272
have cheated earlier.

858
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:26,374
They must be punished for it.

859
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:27,676
And they have been.

860
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:31,041
They were disqualified.
Remember?

861
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:37,591
You only saw that
they had copied the steps.

862
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:40,554
But no one saw...

863
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:45,623
how brilliant their performance was.

864
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:49,434
Everyone makes mistakes.

865
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:51,265
But life is all about...

866
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:53,701
a second chance.

867
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:58,444
I request you, that if you have ever

868
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:00,447
given yourself a second chance...

869
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:02,677
please do so with
the Stunners as well.

870
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:04,384
Because they are
the Indian Stunners...

871
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:06,148
not M um bai Stunners.

872
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:08,714
My team.

873
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,350
Give them one chance.

874
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:15,328
After that, if you like,
you can show them the door.

875
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:19,165
But please...

876
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,430
give them a chance.

877
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:55,731
Know this, fate has strewn
Thorns in my path

878
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:56,663
But I am stubborn

879
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:59,172
I will race ahead of my fate
You cannot stop me

880
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:00,263
Knock me down, I will get up

881
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:02,606
Break the cage and spread my wings

882
01:00:02,665 --> 01:00:05,111
Give it all your might but

883
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:08,342
I will bear it with a smile,
won't bow down my head

884
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:20,652
Know this, fate has strewn
Thorns in my path

885
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:25,028
Knock me down, I will get up

886
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:31,162
As much fire as the deserts hold

887
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:35,540
Furious is the blood
In my veins, but still

888
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:40,047
Ashes suffice for the faithful

889
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:44,651
My silence is enough for me.

890
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:49,588
I have been silenced for so long

891
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:54,391
innocently, I have been bearing it.

892
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:59,195
I have been silenced for so long

893
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:04,034
innocently, I have been bearing it.

894
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:13,479
Know this, fate has strewn
Thorns in my path

895
01:01:23,546 --> 01:01:27,494
There are a hundred questions

896
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:32,462
There are a hundred insults

897
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:40,436
My name bears the burden of stains

898
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:44,741
With the ashes
Burnt by a million dreams

899
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:50,208
These tearless eyes
Bear the last string of hope

900
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:52,412
We were not given another chance

901
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:55,081
Or forgiveness

902
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:59,257
l-low much more do we need to suffer'?

903
01:01:59,315 --> 01:02:04,060
I have been silenced for so long

904
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:08,728
innocently, I have been bearing it.

905
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:13,531
I have been silenced for so long

906
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:18,205
innocently, I have been bearing it.

907
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:49,372
Know this, fate has strewn
Thorns in my path

908
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:53,312
But I am stubborn
I will race ahead of my fate

909
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:57,176
You cannot stop me
Knock me down, I will get up

910
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,080
Break the cage and spread my wings

911
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:04,115
Give it all your might but

912
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:12,694
I will bear it with a smile,
won't bow down my head

913
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:50,595
Vegas! Vegas!

914
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:54,807
See what the bill is.

915
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:57,177
What do you think?

916
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,278
I look like a fool?

917
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:00,578
I am asking them...

918
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:02,047
whether I look like a fool that...

919
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:03,641
he is asking for twenty five lakhs?

920
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:05,014
What should I do?

921
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:07,254
Anna, are you joking?
I trusted you...

922
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:09,312
Am I joking? Or are you?

923
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,287
I agree that you are like family.

924
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:14,155
You come and party here with your
friends after you finish your duty.

925
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:15,992
I have never said anything.
- No... I...

926
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:17,722
Whenever you have wanted an advance
twenty - fifty thousand...

927
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:19,466
I have given it to you...
So that you can go have fun.

928
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:20,500
But today you asked me...

929
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:22,365
'Uncle Harish,
I want twenty five lakhs!'

930
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:24,402
Is that a piece of cake?

931
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,264
Anna, you had promised.

932
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:28,002
In trusting you, I told everyone...

933
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:30,203
Then you should break the promise.
It's that simple.

934
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,107
It's not the word of someone great.

935
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:33,475
It's waiter Suresh's promise.

936
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:34,674
Break it with a crack.

937
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,445
Anna, we have worked very hard.

938
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:38,414
We won in Bangalore.

939
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:41,282
And even if we come third in Vegas...

940
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:43,017
I will give back your money
upon my return...

941
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:44,149
Anna, I promise.

942
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,552
Anna, this is wrong.

943
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:47,424
I trusted you and told everyone...

944
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:50,726
This word 'trust' is irritating me.

945
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:53,394
It is firing me up.
What trust?

946
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:57,628
You've become very sad.

947
01:04:57,693 --> 01:04:59,229
Listen, I will explain to you.

948
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:01,300
If you are going to
Vegas for this girl...

949
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:03,002
Don't you say anything about Vinnie...

950
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,477
Listen to me... it's not worth it.

951
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:07,976
It's better to go
to our local Ivladh Island...

952
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:10,142
Twenty five hundred will suffice. Yes?

953
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:12,444
I told you not to talk
about Vinnie like that.

954
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:13,680
Suru, let him be.

955
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:16,053
Suru, leave him. Come on.

956
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:17,652
Let it go...

957
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:19,148
Let's go...

958
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:26,193
You are my own.

959
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:29,264
Take him away.
- Cheater!

960
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:30,360
Go home!

961
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:31,727
Going to Vegas?

962
01:05:34,563 --> 01:05:35,234
Come.
- Get out of here.

963
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:36,072
Suru. Let it be.

964
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:37,076
He has gone mad.

965
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:38,168
If you don't want to give
the money, then don't.

966
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:39,611
Don't you talk rubbish about the girl.

967
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:41,114
Come on, Suru.
I will break apart the entire place.

968
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:42,513
- I will send you to the police station.
- Call them.

969
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:43,515
- Stop it! Please.

970
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:45,643
They will take you.
You can dance there.

971
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,553
Now the money won't come
from there at all.

972
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:52,453
What shall we do?

973
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:53,550
- It's over.

974
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:54,652
After all this effort...

975
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:56,355
we've been reduced from
a passport to a ration card.

976
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:58,296
Don't get started again, Raghav.
- Okay.

977
01:05:58,487 --> 01:05:59,557
Let's go to Vegas.

978
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,067
It is important for me
to go to go to Vegas, too.

979
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,433
But not at the cost of her honour.
- Suru, look...

980
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:05,027
ls Vegas cancelled?

981
01:06:05,094 --> 01:06:05,469
Sorry, sir.

982
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:06,598
Give me an answer...

983
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:09,143
You said that you would
get the money.

984
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:10,074
I did.
- Yes?

985
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:10,974
Yes, I did.
- Tell me...

986
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:13,172
Sir, it is not Suru's fault.

987
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:14,610
Shetty Anna didn't keep his word...

988
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:15,512
Sir.
- Sir...

989
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:17,113
You idiot!

990
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:19,175
You wasted so much of my time.

991
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:20,743
Sir, please.

992
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:21,681
Please, sir.

993
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:23,155
Sir, sorry. Please, sir.
- I am sorry.

994
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:24,213
Sorry.

995
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,385
It is my fault. Vishnu sir.

996
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:30,019
We have managed only three lakhs
twenty thousand.

997
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:34,193
Shall I take a loan from aunt Ashima.

998
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,030
Or should I sell my bike.

999
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:38,433
Hey guys!

1000
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:40,030
Where do you want to take the ferry
to Vegas from?

1001
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:41,404
From Versova or from Ivladh?

1002
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:42,568
What are you saying?

1003
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:44,542
Why are you upset?
Don't you want to go?

1004
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:46,672
Cockroach,
where did you get this money?

1005
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:48,238
Yes. Vishnu sir.

1006
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:49,641
Vishnu sir has given it?

1007
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:51,547
Vishnu sir hasn't given it.

1008
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:52,677
I took an idea from Vishnu sir...

1009
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:53,686
thought about it and

1010
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:55,154
took the money from my uncle.

1011
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:56,622
- Vishnu...

1012
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:00,020
What is the need to sell this place?

1013
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:01,724
You sold your land for us?

1014
01:07:01,984 --> 01:07:04,396
Do I need the place for my burial?

1015
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:06,364
We will win and come back.

1016
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:08,133
Thank you.

1017
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:09,568
Suru.

1018
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:11,733
What did you think?

1019
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:15,633
That I could not think
because I was angry?

1020
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:17,573
Guys, get ready for Vegas?

1021
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:19,476
Yes, sir!

1022
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:12,489
Yes, it is done.

1023
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:14,259
The visas are done and

1024
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:16,064
we have the money
for the ticket as well.

1025
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:17,727
I am coming to America.

1026
01:08:17,993 --> 01:08:19,666
Today is the best day of my life.

1027
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:22,334
Best. Best. Best. Yes!

1028
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:35,352
America. Vegas. Happy.

1029
01:08:35,978 --> 01:08:37,252
Happy, happy-

1030
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:41,586
Vinod, I have been trying
since eight years.

1031
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:43,623
It has come true now.

1032
01:08:43,686 --> 01:08:45,097
I will make my dream come true.

1033
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:48,396
You think Suresh and
Vernon found me?

1034
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:50,698
I found them.

1035
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:53,605
Come, sit. I will tell you everything.

1036
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:55,642
Who will you tell anyway...

1037
01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:57,406
I don't care what you guys do

1038
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:58,740
once you get to Vegas.

1039
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:01,208
But I have my plans laid out.

1040
01:09:01,403 --> 01:09:03,314
I was there when Suresh

1041
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:04,707
was planning Vegas.

1042
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:07,348
I met him.

1043
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,115
Repeatedly.

1044
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,522
I impressed him.

1045
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:12,987
I impressed all of you

1046
01:09:13,282 --> 01:09:15,489
and became your guru.

1047
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:18,259
And now finally, my plan
is about to take off!

1048
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:21,297
Vegas, I'm on my way!

1049
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:02,765
- Stop! Stop!

1050
01:10:04,299 --> 01:10:05,869
- You, you, you! Step aside.

1051
01:10:17,312 --> 01:10:18,347
Really?

1052
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:19,848
A hip-hop show.

1053
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:21,987
Is this yours?

1054
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:24,253
Oh, what do we have here?

1055
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:29,467
Do you have a prescription
for this, sir?

1056
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:32,797
Hold on.

1057
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:35,671
No prescription. No medicine.

1058
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:36,732
- Sorry.

1059
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:39,477
Hey...

1060
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:43,441
I need you guys...

1061
01:10:43,905 --> 01:10:47,409
to take off your jackets
and your shoes.

1062
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:48,513
Shoes?

1063
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:49,647
- Yes, shoes.

1064
01:10:51,613 --> 01:10:52,489
Shoes.

1065
01:10:53,815 --> 01:10:54,793
Shoes!

1066
01:11:15,837 --> 01:11:17,316
Guys, come on.

1067
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:34,632
Hi!

1068
01:11:34,856 --> 01:11:36,733
India. .. Indian Stunners.

1069
01:11:36,758 --> 01:11:37,930
Control yourself, Vinnie.

1070
01:11:40,429 --> 01:11:42,773
Alright! Here are your badges...

1071
01:11:43,498 --> 01:11:45,273
You guys go straight and left.

1072
01:11:46,601 --> 01:11:47,545
Left?

1073
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:56,584
Boys, there are a lot of teams...

1074
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:58,283
therefore, we have got a few rooms.

1075
01:11:58,347 --> 01:11:59,985
Of course, there is one for me...

1076
01:12:00,248 --> 01:12:01,283
one for Vinnie and

1077
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:04,456
one for all the boys...

1078
01:12:19,901 --> 01:12:20,971
Check that out!

1079
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:26,480
This is mind blowing!

1080
01:12:47,295 --> 01:12:53,803
Sorry sorry sorry...
Will you punish me for it?

1081
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:57,816
Yes, Vegas!

1082
01:12:57,839 --> 01:12:59,876
Boys, is there a place

1083
01:12:59,941 --> 01:13:02,945
like this in the whole world?
- It's fun like none other.

1084
01:13:04,913 --> 01:13:05,983
Sir... sir.

1085
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:08,524
Sir! It's only apple juice.

1086
01:13:09,751 --> 01:13:10,923
Vinnie, go out.

1087
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:11,760
- Sit in the water.

1088
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:12,821
He)', guys.

1089
01:13:13,321 --> 01:13:15,801
Juniors and Varsity compete
in the ne><t two days.

1090
01:13:15,857 --> 01:13:17,768
There is still some time
for the main event.

1091
01:13:18,627 --> 01:13:20,629
Sir, what will we do for two days?

1092
01:13:20,695 --> 01:13:21,765
We will rehearse.

1093
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:23,503
Be quiet. Are you crazy! No.

1094
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:24,635
Guys, you are in Vegas.

1095
01:13:24,699 --> 01:13:27,646
Everyone knows what
an amazing place this is.

1096
01:13:27,702 --> 01:13:29,340
So, whatever you want to do, do it.

1097
01:13:29,404 --> 01:13:32,214
I don't ask you and
you don't ask me where I was.

1098
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:52,370
You are our God!

1099
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:17,219
This heart has been saved
A hundred times

1100
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:20,329
The heart has escaped
A hundred times

1101
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:23,926
We forgot the world

1102
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:27,730
After finding love!

1103
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:31,707
There is me and you, the way
To the heart is through itself

1104
01:14:31,766 --> 01:14:34,770
But this feeling is a little new
Know this!

1105
01:14:35,837 --> 01:14:39,250
There is me and you
Why do you ask, 'What to do?'

1106
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:42,412
The fun starts now
Dance away!

1107
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:47,291
O O O Listen...
Dance, my love, dance!

1108
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:50,887
Hey! O O O
Dance, my love, dance!

1109
01:14:50,952 --> 01:14:54,695
O O O Listen...
Dance, my love, dance!

1110
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:58,465
Hey! O O O
Dance, my love, dance!

1111
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:01,741
No worries
Dance, my love, dance!

1112
01:15:01,796 --> 01:15:05,972
Listen! O O O
Dance, my love, dance!

1113
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:31,936
Do as I do,

1114
01:15:32,193 --> 01:15:35,902
Then why feel shy?

1115
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:42,740
Forget about the morning
The game is on for tonight

1116
01:15:43,572 --> 01:15:46,849
I have seen, I have heard
Deeds of this day

1117
01:15:46,908 --> 01:15:50,378
It is a secret
Know this!

1118
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:54,422
There is me and you, the way
To the heart is through itself

1119
01:15:54,482 --> 01:15:57,486
But this feeling is a little new
Know this!

1120
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:02,397
O O O Listen...
Dance, my love, dance!

1121
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:05,904
Hey! O O O
Dance, my love, dance!

1122
01:16:06,194 --> 01:16:09,334
Hey! O O O
Dance, my love, dance!

1123
01:16:09,397 --> 01:16:13,607
Listen! O O O
Dance, my love, dance!

1124
01:16:23,311 --> 01:16:25,348
Hi,
Are you Indian?

1125
01:16:25,413 --> 01:16:27,393
Mobile number?
- Thanks.

1126
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:28,450
I'll call you.

1127
01:16:43,598 --> 01:16:47,512
O O O Listen...
Dance, my love, dance!

1128
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:54,812
O O O Listen...
Dance, my love, dance!

1129
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:58,653
Hey! O O O
Dance, my love, dance!

1130
01:17:16,197 --> 01:17:18,199
Five... six... seven... eight...

1131
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:24,611
You should drink in moderation.

1132
01:17:25,373 --> 01:17:26,374
That's enough.

1133
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:29,320
Come on. Let's practice again.

1134
01:17:29,377 --> 01:17:31,152
Chotu, give us the count. Come on...

1135
01:17:31,212 --> 01:17:33,351
I've seen many enthusiastic dancers...

1136
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:34,587
but not one more
enthusiastic than her.

1137
01:17:34,649 --> 01:17:35,821
What does she eat?

1138
01:17:36,217 --> 01:17:39,289
Don't you guys want to rehearse?
- No...

1139
01:17:39,354 --> 01:17:41,527
Vinnie, we have practiced
nearly fifteen times.

1140
01:17:41,589 --> 01:17:42,624
The boys are very tired.

1141
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:44,364
Please. And Vishnu sir had said

1142
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:45,837
that we do not have to
rehearse so many times.

1143
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:47,737
But why are rehearsals a problem?

1144
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:49,798
Rehearsing too much
could cause injuries.

1145
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:51,266
Exactly, sir.

1146
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:53,879
The number one reason for injuries

1147
01:17:53,902 --> 01:17:55,813
during competitions, is fatigue.

1148
01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:57,349
In the excitement of
being in a new place...

1149
01:17:57,405 --> 01:17:59,885
you have forgotten
that your body needs rest.

1150
01:18:00,341 --> 01:18:01,843
That is why I told you, no rehearsals.

1151
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:03,850
Someone take control of Vinnie!

1152
01:18:03,912 --> 01:18:04,822
Got that?

1153
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:08,455
We had carried so much
money from Mumbai.

1154
01:18:08,516 --> 01:18:09,358
Now, there's barely anything.

1155
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:11,658
If luck was on our side,
it would have doubled.

1156
01:18:12,687 --> 01:18:14,860
This is the team's money, idiots!

1157
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:17,365
Vishnu sir is here.

1158
01:18:17,425 --> 01:18:19,234
Sir...

1159
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:20,773
Please keep the money with you.

1160
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:22,399
The boys are up to a lot of mischief
since yesterday.

1161
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:23,374
They will spend it all.

1162
01:18:23,431 --> 01:18:24,842
It is your responsibility from now on.
Please...

1163
01:18:24,899 --> 01:18:26,207
Come on. Let's go!

1164
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:40,155
I think we will have to
practice in that area.

1165
01:18:41,349 --> 01:18:42,521
Oh! Philippines...

1166
01:18:42,584 --> 01:18:44,791
Boys, Philippine All Stars.

1167
01:18:46,588 --> 01:18:48,568
Let's go meet them.

1168
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:54,832
Sir, I love you...
I love your dance!

1169
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:11,814
Wait...

1170
01:19:13,948 --> 01:19:15,393
What's wrong with you?

1171
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:16,728
Suru.

1172
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:19,290
Guys, what happened?

1173
01:19:19,687 --> 01:19:21,826
Okay. Hold it. Guys...

1174
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:23,767
I am sorry.
- Go.

1175
01:19:24,492 --> 01:19:26,631
Yes, I have the money.

1176
01:19:26,861 --> 01:19:29,637
They have moved to
the qualifying round.

1177
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:34,210
Such great teams from all over
the world have come here.

1178
01:19:35,236 --> 01:19:37,648
I am worried.
If they don't qualify...

1179
01:19:37,705 --> 01:19:39,707
then along with them...

1180
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:41,754
even I will have to go back to India.

1181
01:19:44,212 --> 01:19:45,486
Ladies and Gentlemen...

1182
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:47,754
Welcome to Las Vegas, Nevada.

1183
01:19:50,218 --> 01:19:52,721
Ladies and gentlemen,
I also want to thank our friends at...

1184
01:19:52,787 --> 01:19:54,630
Ponds Men's Face Wash.

1185
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:56,424
Ladies and Gentlemen...

1186
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:57,993
I proudly bring to you...

1187
01:19:58,359 --> 01:20:03,604
the Ponds Men's Face Wash
World Starz Hip Hop Challenge.

1188
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:36,600
The Philippine All Stars!

1189
01:20:36,664 --> 01:20:38,974
Victory to Mother India.

1190
01:20:42,303 --> 01:20:43,611
Viva, Brazil!

1191
01:20:43,671 --> 01:20:45,378
Super Hoods!

1192
01:20:47,775 --> 01:20:49,652
That was superb!

1193
01:20:51,579 --> 01:20:53,490
Very nice... superb, boys!

1194
01:20:55,917 --> 01:21:00,457
Oh, look at you...
Go home... No qualify!

1195
01:21:00,521 --> 01:21:03,730
What's his problem?

1196
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:05,960
Come on, boys.

1197
01:21:06,728 --> 01:21:08,264
Let's go, boys!

1198
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:14,842
My oh my! Bringing a little curry

1199
01:21:14,903 --> 01:21:16,849
in a Hip Hop flavor...

1200
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:21,513
there is also a team from India!

1201
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:21,365
- Can you feel all that energy
in the atmosphere?

1202
01:23:21,429 --> 01:23:24,239
The Indian Stunners,
all the way from India...

1203
01:23:24,298 --> 01:23:25,800
have entered the contest.

1204
01:23:26,567 --> 01:23:31,380
Vishnu sir, we have qualified!
Sir, we made it.

1205
01:23:31,873 --> 01:23:34,251
Here we are at the
World Starz Hip Hop Competition

1206
01:23:34,308 --> 01:23:36,515
Here we have the team from India...

1207
01:23:36,577 --> 01:23:37,954
win here for the first time ever.

1208
01:23:38,212 --> 01:23:40,715
It's your first time here ever...

1209
01:23:40,782 --> 01:23:42,352
and you have stormed
into the qualifiers.

1210
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:43,657
L-low does it feel'?

1211
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,525
Yes... yes, we are all very happy.

1212
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:49,268
We have reached the qualifier round

1213
01:23:49,323 --> 01:23:51,667
for the first time.
- Speak to her in English.

1214
01:23:51,726 --> 01:23:52,932
Yes! Yes!

1215
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:53,729
And... first time.

1216
01:23:53,795 --> 01:23:54,569
It's history.

1217
01:23:54,629 --> 01:23:56,404
In the first attempt, a country

1218
01:23:56,464 --> 01:23:57,841
has reached the qualifying round.

1219
01:23:57,899 --> 01:23:59,378
And that's why all the boys

1220
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:01,277
are happy and even the girl.

1221
01:24:01,335 --> 01:24:02,473
Victory to India.

1222
01:24:02,603 --> 01:24:04,412
There is so much excitement there...

1223
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:05,951
you can feel it. That's great!

1224
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:07,709
This is our guru, our choreographer.

1225
01:24:07,742 --> 01:24:10,518
This is the guru.
Let's ask him - how do you feel'?

1226
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:11,785
What do you want to say?

1227
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:14,288
I am haPPY-

1228
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:16,326
He is happy.

1229
01:24:31,532 --> 01:24:34,604
Come on...
five... six... seven... eight.

1230
01:24:34,635 --> 01:24:36,239
Lift her, hold. Superb!

1231
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:39,647
Very good, guys.
Get her down.

1232
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:42,915
Super, boys!
Very good Vinnie, Vernon.

1233
01:24:44,879 --> 01:24:47,291
Let's do it once more.
- Please, no...

1234
01:24:47,348 --> 01:24:48,554
Please.
- One more time.

1235
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:50,620
You have irritated us by rehearsing
fifty times already.

1236
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:52,858
The boys are tired, Vinnie...
- Tell her...

1237
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:54,460
I want to do the lift once more.

1238
01:24:54,522 --> 01:24:56,763
Come on, boys.

1239
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:57,961
Come on, boys.

1240
01:24:58,493 --> 01:24:59,471
Yes. Last one, please.

1241
01:24:59,527 --> 01:25:00,403
Suru, last one, please.

1242
01:25:00,461 --> 01:25:01,201
Q Kay-

1243
01:25:01,529 --> 01:25:02,564
Boys.

1244
01:25:03,831 --> 01:25:04,571
Ready?

1245
01:25:04,632 --> 01:25:07,272
Five... six... seven... go...

1246
01:25:07,535 --> 01:25:10,516
Hope... hold.

1247
01:25:11,472 --> 01:25:12,883
Guys, hold her firmly.

1248
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:14,613
I told you not to practice
so many times.

1249
01:25:14,675 --> 01:25:15,619
Didn't I?

1250
01:25:16,344 --> 01:25:17,652
She insisted.

1251
01:25:19,347 --> 01:25:20,417
Suru...

1252
01:25:21,716 --> 01:25:22,558
Go to her.

1253
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:24,324
What happened? Are you okay?
- Suru...

1254
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,353
Is it hurting?

1255
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:31,927
D...

1256
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:34,439
Call Vishnu sir.

1257
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:36,601
Tell him that Vinnie is hurt
and to come to the hospital quickly.

1258
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:38,166
I've run out credits,
can I use your phone?

1259
01:25:38,232 --> 01:25:39,609
Here.
Nevada Hills Hospital.

1260
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:40,839
Hurry UP-

1261
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:44,406
Vinnie...

1262
01:25:44,839 --> 01:25:46,614
Hi, Vinnie.
- Hi!

1263
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:48,579
Sir, is she okay?

1264
01:25:48,609 --> 01:25:50,589
Yes. Well,
I have checked Vinnie's scan.

1265
01:25:50,611 --> 01:25:52,557
She has a stretched deltoid...

1266
01:25:52,613 --> 01:25:54,718
and an out of line femur.

1267
01:25:55,283 --> 01:25:57,627
Doctor, has she broken a bone?

1268
01:25:57,952 --> 01:26:00,193
No. No. The bone has not broken.

1269
01:26:00,955 --> 01:26:01,592
Thank God!

1270
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:02,828
So can we take her home?

1271
01:26:02,890 --> 01:26:05,427
By all means. But she needs rice...

1272
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:07,404
Rice. I told you to eat rice.

1273
01:26:07,461 --> 01:26:08,496
She was not eating rice.

1274
01:26:08,563 --> 01:26:12,272
Sir, she doesn't eat rice,
only flatbreads.

1275
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,970
No. Not that rice.

1276
01:26:14,235 --> 01:26:15,339
R-I-C-E.

1277
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:17,881
Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation.

1278
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:19,383
You understand?

1279
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:20,578
Yes.

1280
01:26:20,741 --> 01:26:21,879
Can she dance?

1281
01:26:21,943 --> 01:26:22,887
No. I am afraid not.

1282
01:26:22,944 --> 01:26:24,890
She needs rest for at least a week.

1283
01:26:24,912 --> 01:26:25,890
One...

1284
01:26:25,913 --> 01:26:27,324
One week!

1285
01:26:27,882 --> 01:26:28,826
Q Kay-

1286
01:26:29,383 --> 01:26:30,418
Here is her file.

1287
01:26:31,152 --> 01:26:31,892
Don't worry, she will be fine.

1288
01:26:32,153 --> 01:26:33,530
Don't worry, my dear.
You'll be fine.

1289
01:26:33,921 --> 01:26:35,400
Thank you, sir.
- That's okay.

1290
01:26:38,326 --> 01:26:39,464
I'm sorry, Suru...

1291
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:41,564
No need to apologize.
There's nothing wrong with you.

1292
01:26:41,796 --> 01:26:43,207
You'll be alright...

1293
01:26:43,264 --> 01:26:45,266
It's my fault...

1294
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:47,210
Vishnu sir told us
not to rehearse so much

1295
01:26:47,268 --> 01:26:49,441
and I got over-excited...

1296
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:50,574
I'm really sorry!

1297
01:26:50,638 --> 01:26:51,776
I'm in the centre of our ne><t act...

1298
01:26:51,839 --> 01:26:53,443
Now what will we do?

1299
01:26:53,774 --> 01:26:56,653
Listen... don't get worked up... we'll
make some changes in the routine...

1300
01:26:57,411 --> 01:26:59,448
We'll do something...
- Have you lost it?

1301
01:26:59,947 --> 01:27:02,223
We'll lose a lot of time doing this...

1302
01:27:02,683 --> 01:27:05,425
Suru, we'll need to
find a replacement for her.

1303
01:27:05,486 --> 01:27:08,228
And how do we do that'?
We are in Vegas!

1304
01:27:08,656 --> 01:27:09,896
We need an Indian dancer...

1305
01:27:10,191 --> 01:27:11,795
here and now...
Where will we find someone now?

1306
01:27:11,892 --> 01:27:14,429
We'll get...
- From where?

1307
01:27:15,363 --> 01:27:16,535
We will surely...

1308
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,645
Who knew Vernon is this clever...

1309
01:27:24,972 --> 01:27:27,145
Vernon, where are you taking us?

1310
01:27:37,551 --> 01:27:41,863
Come! Say where pal'?
Tell me how it's gonna be'?

01:27:41,922 --> 01:27:46,302

He says that you dance very well.

Very well.

1346
01:31:33,787 --> 01:31:35,664
English.
- I have to speak to her in English?

1347
01:31:36,357 --> 01:31:37,768
You dance very...

1348
01:31:37,825 --> 01:31:40,431
Good.

01:31:40,494 --> 01:31:41,495
Ah! Thank you very much.

1350
01:31:41,562 --> 01:31:42,870
You dance very well, too.

1351
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:44,238
Oh, thank you.

1352
01:31:44,498 --> 01:31:46,569
And Vinnie? Where is Vinnie?

1353
01:31:46,634 --> 01:31:48,875
You know Vinnie as well?

1354
01:31:48,936 --> 01:31:50,745
Come on. Everyone knows you guys.

1355
01:31:50,804 --> 01:31:52,784
You guys are the
Indian Stunners, right?

1356
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:53,784
I know.

1357
01:31:53,841 --> 01:31:54,785
Did you hear that, buddy?

1358
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:57,584
Yes. But maybe you don't know that
Vinnie has recently injured herself.

1359
01:31:57,645 --> 01:31:58,521
What?

1360
01:31:59,813 --> 01:32:01,224
We need your help, Olive.

1361
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:04,727
So, this is where we kind of rehearse.

1362
01:32:04,785 --> 01:32:05,695
Wow! It's huge.

1363
01:32:05,753 --> 01:32:07,289
Boys, this is Olive.

1364
01:32:07,354 --> 01:32:08,332
We've got the permissions.

1365
01:32:08,389 --> 01:32:10,630
And now she's in our team.
Any questions?

1366
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:12,432
This is Vinnie... That's Jack.

1367
01:32:12,493 --> 01:32:14,439
This is Pawan
- l-low are you'?

1368
01:32:14,495 --> 01:32:16,270
Everyone say 'hi'!

1369
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:18,833
This is so bad.
You are hurt so badly.

1370
01:32:20,534 --> 01:32:22,673
Guys, this is great!

1371
01:32:22,736 --> 01:32:24,716
What are you saying, Vinnie?
Look at your leg.

1372
01:32:24,972 --> 01:32:26,610
Vernon, it is great.

1373
01:32:26,674 --> 01:32:28,312
If she hadn't hurt herself

1374
01:32:28,375 --> 01:32:30,480
how would a great dancer
like Olive have joined our group'?

1375
01:32:30,511 --> 01:32:31,683
I guess
- Really!

1376
01:32:31,745 --> 01:32:33,281
That's so mean.

1377
01:32:33,347 --> 01:32:34,917
Olive, don't listen to him.

1378
01:32:35,182 --> 01:32:36,525
He is talking rubbish.
- Seriously.

1379
01:32:37,685 --> 01:32:39,722
Anyway. Where is Vishnu sir?

1380
01:32:57,938 --> 01:32:59,849
I haven't seen him after
the qualifiers. I will look for him.

1381
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:02,513
Vernon, you will have to teach Olive.
You wait.

1382
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:04,821
Yes. The choreography.
I need to learn this.

1383
01:33:04,878 --> 01:33:07,552
Yes, we will. D, you go.

1384
01:33:07,615 --> 01:33:08,423
Raghav, you too.

1385
01:33:08,482 --> 01:33:10,325
Tell him we are at rehearsals
and to come quickly.

1386
01:33:10,384 --> 01:33:10,953
Go quickly.

1387
01:33:11,218 --> 01:33:13,494
Boys, hurry up.
Raghav, that way.

1388
01:33:30,904 --> 01:33:32,508
Five and six...
- Boys!

1389
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:37,181
Guys, guys, guys.
We are doomed.

1390
01:33:37,211 --> 01:33:38,485
Vishnu sir is nowhere to be seen.

1391
01:33:38,545 --> 01:33:39,546
He has even checked out of the hotel.

1392
01:33:39,613 --> 01:33:40,489
All the money is also with him.

1393
01:33:40,547 --> 01:33:41,423
What do you mean?

1394
01:33:41,482 --> 01:33:42,825
I mean he is a thief.

1395
01:33:42,883 --> 01:33:44,521
You took the money
from me to give to him.

1396
01:33:44,585 --> 01:33:46,531
I told you, don't trust this man.

1397
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:48,663
Did you guy check properly
near the bed and...

1398
01:33:48,722 --> 01:33:50,724
He just told you,
he has checked out...

1399
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:52,236
He is nowhere. There is nothing.

1400
01:33:52,292 --> 01:33:53,794
All the money, everything is gone.

1401
01:33:54,361 --> 01:33:55,669
My uncle will kill me.

1402
01:33:55,729 --> 01:33:56,901
He had given the money
with a lot of difficulty.

1403
01:33:56,964 --> 01:33:58,807
The competition is
still to come, Suru.

1404
01:34:00,734 --> 01:34:01,872
Think of something.

1405
01:34:01,935 --> 01:34:04,415
- He took a bag...
He left with the money.

1406
01:34:04,471 --> 01:34:05,882
The entire competition
is still ahead of us.

1407
01:34:05,939 --> 01:34:07,350
We have nothing in our pockets.

1408
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:08,648
What will we do now?

1409
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:11,683
We cannot do anything.
- What should we do?

1410
01:34:11,745 --> 01:34:13,486
Now what? Pick up your bags
and let's go.

1411
01:34:13,547 --> 01:34:15,618
Boys...
- Nothing can be done now.

1412
01:34:15,683 --> 01:34:18,687
We are done with the competition.

1413
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:20,592
Boys...
- What will we do?

1414
01:34:20,654 --> 01:34:23,430
Yes, let's go... Let's go.

1415
01:34:23,490 --> 01:34:24,662
Hurry up. Pack your bags.
- Suru...

1416
01:34:24,725 --> 01:34:26,864
Vinnie, pack up. Let's go.

1417
01:34:31,932 --> 01:34:34,310
Why did you come here? Why?

1418
01:34:36,170 --> 01:34:38,810
For the competition.
- ""For the competition... competition...""

1419
01:34:40,808 --> 01:34:41,843
And why did you come?

1420
01:34:42,309 --> 01:34:43,413
Why did we come, Vernon?

1421
01:34:43,610 --> 01:34:47,490
You have been a background dancer
for the last ten years in India.

1422
01:34:50,350 --> 01:34:51,420
And you?

1423
01:34:51,485 --> 01:34:54,591
You cannot speak...
why did you come here?

1424
01:34:54,955 --> 01:34:55,933
To Vegas... Why'?

1425
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,268
For honour.

1426
01:35:01,795 --> 01:35:03,672
And you, D?
Why did you come here?

1427
01:35:03,731 --> 01:35:05,404
You were so popular in Gujarat.

1428
01:35:05,466 --> 01:35:07,377
Young kids used to learn from you,
isn't it?

1429
01:35:07,434 --> 01:35:10,472
Why are you teaching kids hip-hop?

1430
01:35:10,537 --> 01:35:11,709
Why are you wasting their time?

1431
01:35:12,539 --> 01:35:13,882
Just so that we can show everyone...

1432
01:35:13,941 --> 01:35:16,444
back home that we are thieves?

1433
01:35:17,544 --> 01:35:19,683
Previously when we were
the Mumbai Stunners...

1434
01:35:19,847 --> 01:35:21,622
They told us that we had copied...

1435
01:35:22,316 --> 01:35:24,523
But now we are the Indian Stunners.

1436
01:35:24,818 --> 01:35:27,389
Indian Stunners... We represent India.

1437
01:35:28,522 --> 01:35:31,162
If the choreographer leaves if
one person leaves, is the group over?

1438
01:35:31,458 --> 01:35:32,903
Is Indian Stunners over?

1439
01:35:34,261 --> 01:35:34,762
Let everyone hear it.

1440
01:35:34,828 --> 01:35:36,466
Let them all know too,
the Philippines...

1441
01:35:36,530 --> 01:35:38,840
and English team see that
Indians are thieves...

1442
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:40,674
Is that what you want to show?

1443
01:35:42,202 --> 01:35:43,510
Say it. Let me hear it.

1444
01:35:45,472 --> 01:35:46,644
I am here in front of you, right?

1445
01:35:46,907 --> 01:35:48,181
Vernon is here, too.

1446
01:35:48,242 --> 01:35:51,348
Each one of us is here to dance.

1447
01:35:51,612 --> 01:35:52,818
We want to dance.

1448
01:35:57,818 --> 01:35:59,798
We dance to express, not to impress.

1449
01:35:59,853 --> 01:36:01,764
We've not come here for money.

1450
01:36:06,326 --> 01:36:07,430
So just dance.

1451
01:36:07,494 --> 01:36:08,598
Don't worry about the money.

1452
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:10,600
We will deal with everything later.

1453
01:36:10,664 --> 01:36:12,541
We came here to dance
and dance, we will.

1454
01:36:12,599 --> 01:36:14,374
Yes.
- Come on, boys.

1455
01:36:17,371 --> 01:36:18,543
Let's take it from the top, Vernon.
- Come on.

1456
01:36:18,572 --> 01:36:20,643
Five... six... seven... eight...

1457
01:36:20,707 --> 01:36:21,947
One and two... three and four...

1458
01:36:22,209 --> 01:36:23,347
One and two... three and four...

1459
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:25,583
Five and six... seven and eight...

1460
01:36:25,646 --> 01:36:27,319
Bring her down carefully.

1461
01:36:27,548 --> 01:36:28,856
Very good. Good job!

1462
01:36:28,916 --> 01:36:30,486
Very good, Olive!

1463
01:36:30,551 --> 01:36:32,292
Superb!
- Vernon, it is good.

1464
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:34,164
Can you give me some water.

1465
01:36:37,357 --> 01:36:38,802
Vernon, that can be bettered.
- Suru...

1466
01:36:39,326 --> 01:36:40,828
Sit here for a minute please.
- What is it?

1467
01:36:44,898 --> 01:36:48,402
I hope you realize that
you have persuaded them again.

1468
01:36:49,269 --> 01:36:50,407
I know.

1469
01:36:50,804 --> 01:36:52,613
But if I wouldn't
have said all that...

1470
01:36:52,906 --> 01:36:54,613
our team wouldn't have reached here.

1471
01:36:55,275 --> 01:36:58,552
But money is so
important at this point.

1472
01:36:59,479 --> 01:37:00,685
If we don't have the money
after the performance...

1473
01:37:00,747 --> 01:37:02,192
what will we do?

1474
01:37:21,468 --> 01:37:22,344
Vishnu...

1475
01:37:28,208 --> 01:37:29,186
Hi, Swati.

1476
01:37:35,382 --> 01:37:36,725
Have a seat.

1477
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:55,175
Did you come to America
for some work?

1478
01:37:57,304 --> 01:38:01,309
Swati, it has taken me
eight years to get here.

1479
01:38:01,541 --> 01:38:05,546
You have no idea what all I have gone
through in these eight years, Swati.

1480
01:38:05,879 --> 01:38:08,450
I have only come...

1481
01:38:09,516 --> 01:38:11,962
to meet my son Ivlanu.

1482
01:38:15,889 --> 01:38:17,732
What will you accomplish
by meeting Ivlanu now?

1483
01:38:19,393 --> 01:38:20,599
- Isn't it a little too late?

1484
01:38:22,296 --> 01:38:23,366
I am married now.

1485
01:38:24,531 --> 01:38:25,771
Ivlanu has a father

1486
01:38:26,767 --> 01:38:28,269
who loves him a lot.

1487
01:38:29,703 --> 01:38:32,206
He is a normal man...

1488
01:38:32,472 --> 01:38:33,542
who has a normal job.

1489
01:38:33,607 --> 01:38:35,211
He goes to the office.

1490
01:38:35,342 --> 01:38:37,322
He has the weekends off

1491
01:38:37,377 --> 01:38:39,789
and takes his family out.

1492
01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:41,591
He is a normal guy.

1493
01:38:41,848 --> 01:38:43,259
He looks after us...

1494
01:38:43,717 --> 01:38:45,856
He is not a struggling choreographer

1495
01:38:45,886 --> 01:38:48,230
who is always on the
lookout for his ne><t job.

1496
01:38:48,689 --> 01:38:49,724
You understand?

1497
01:38:57,698 --> 01:39:01,305
Vishnu, relationships
are made and broken.

1498
01:39:03,670 --> 01:39:04,671
I have moved on.

1499
01:39:06,206 --> 01:39:07,184
So should you.

1500
01:39:07,574 --> 01:39:09,611
I know... but...

1501
01:39:10,344 --> 01:39:12,517
Our relationship can break.

1502
01:39:12,579 --> 01:39:16,288
But not menu's and mine.

1503
01:39:17,384 --> 01:39:20,490
You live your life.
Be happy. No problem.

1504
01:39:20,620 --> 01:39:22,861
But please let me meet Ivlanu once.

1505
01:39:27,327 --> 01:39:28,806
I don't think it is a good idea.

1506
01:39:31,465 --> 01:39:33,536
I think you should leave now.

1507
01:39:33,967 --> 01:39:34,945
<i>Reese Swain.</i>

1508
01:39:35,369 --> 01:39:36,404
I am sorry.

1509
01:39:37,871 --> 01:39:38,713
<i>- Hey, mom.</i>

1510
01:40:07,834 --> 01:40:09,609
Hey, you are Vishnu. Aren't you?

1511
01:40:11,271 --> 01:40:12,477
Oh, hello, Vishnu sir.

1512
01:40:12,773 --> 01:40:13,911
Mom, you know him?

1513
01:40:13,974 --> 01:40:14,816
You know him?

1514
01:40:14,875 --> 01:40:16,286
Of course I know him.

1515
01:40:16,343 --> 01:40:17,981
He is Vishnu. Vishnu sir.

1516
01:40:18,245 --> 01:40:19,519
Where is your phone?

1517
01:40:19,579 --> 01:40:20,853
Yes. Here...

1518
01:40:38,832 --> 01:40:40,209
Hey... This is you, right?

1519
01:40:42,269 --> 01:40:43,407
Yes! I knew it.

1520
01:40:43,570 --> 01:40:44,412
Mom...

1521
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:47,718
You like hip-hop?

1522
01:40:47,874 --> 01:40:49,444
Of course. I love hip-hop.

1523
01:40:49,509 --> 01:40:51,819
I even saw your
Bangalore act on YouTube.

1524
01:40:51,978 --> 01:40:53,321
It was fab!

1525
01:40:53,613 --> 01:40:56,651
Mom, do you know that
Vishnu sir's team...

1526
01:40:56,716 --> 01:40:57,990
is the first Indian team...

1527
01:40:58,251 --> 01:41:00,697
that has qualified for the
semi finals in Las Vegas?

1528
01:41:01,588 --> 01:41:02,965
Yes, it's been all over.

1529
01:41:03,223 --> 01:41:04,861
Can I please have a picture with you?

1530
01:41:04,925 --> 01:41:06,529
My friends are gonna burn!

1531
01:41:06,593 --> 01:41:07,867
Come.
- Mom, click fast.

1532
01:41:52,839 --> 01:41:53,840
Thank you.

1533
01:41:59,579 --> 01:42:03,254
Ivlanu, Vishnu sir is getting late.

1534
01:42:04,684 --> 01:42:06,493
Thank you, Vishnu sir. Bye.

1535
01:42:23,537 --> 01:42:25,744
Mom, you know him?
- Yes, he's an old friend.

1536
01:42:35,782 --> 01:42:36,760
Vishnu sir...

1537
01:42:44,591 --> 01:42:45,934
India will win, won't it?

1538
01:42:48,461 --> 01:42:49,701
India has already won.

1539
01:42:52,332 --> 01:42:53,367
Take care.

1540
01:42:58,271 --> 01:43:00,842
Thank you, Gopi,
for helping me out.

1541
01:43:00,907 --> 01:43:02,545
Don't mention it.

1542
01:43:02,609 --> 01:43:04,384
You have been waiting to meet Ivlanu
since the last eight years.

1543
01:43:04,911 --> 01:43:05,912
You met him.

1544
01:43:06,446 --> 01:43:07,516
Are you happy now?

1545
01:43:08,748 --> 01:43:09,783
Very!

1546
01:43:15,422 --> 01:43:17,265
Vishnu, our team...

1547
01:43:17,857 --> 01:43:18,801
Who is she?

1548
01:43:20,827 --> 01:43:22,807
Looks like there's been a problem.

1549
01:46:06,826 --> 01:46:08,203
Boys, wake up.

1550
01:46:08,828 --> 01:46:11,809
Oh sacred waters!

1551
01:46:12,599 --> 01:46:14,977
You guys will drown in there.
- Raghav, what are you doing?

1552
01:46:18,238 --> 01:46:19,649
L-low much fun is this!

1553
01:46:20,707 --> 01:46:21,981
What happened?

1554
01:46:23,676 --> 01:46:25,383
Did this happen in the night?

1555
01:46:29,849 --> 01:46:32,659
- There's a hot water spring
that feels like this in Haridvvar...

1556
01:46:46,566 --> 01:46:47,874
- We just need some more time.

1557
01:46:47,934 --> 01:46:50,414
No, you got to listen.
You got to get the money together.

1558
01:46:50,470 --> 01:46:51,881
But do you know how
they've come from India'?

1559
01:46:51,938 --> 01:46:52,916
I understand that.
-And I am so...

1560
01:46:53,173 --> 01:46:54,914
I know all that, but listen...
what I'm trying to tell you

1561
01:46:55,175 --> 01:46:56,552
is that it's the rule.

1562
01:46:56,609 --> 01:46:58,714
I got to follow them.
You got to follow them. Okay?

1563
01:46:58,778 --> 01:47:00,587
Look... You have till 12 o'clock

1564
01:47:00,613 --> 01:47:01,387
to get the money.

1565
01:47:01,448 --> 01:47:01,926
If you don't...

1566
01:47:02,182 --> 01:47:02,853
you just got to go home.

1567
01:47:02,916 --> 01:47:03,690
Sir, but we just need one chance.

1568
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:04,626
Stop it.

1569
01:47:04,784 --> 01:47:06,525
You just got to pay up or go home.

1570
01:47:06,586 --> 01:47:07,428
Okay.
- I'm sorry.

1571
01:47:07,487 --> 01:47:08,761
Okay.
- Sir, please...

1572
01:47:10,790 --> 01:47:11,768
What happened?

1573
01:47:12,792 --> 01:47:14,237
We need to pay the money.

1574
01:47:14,427 --> 01:47:15,462
NOW!

1575
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:17,840
What did you say?

1576
01:47:17,897 --> 01:47:21,310
""What have we come here to do?
We have come to dance.""

1577
01:47:21,835 --> 01:47:23,940
What have we achieved with all this
dancing? We are broke.

1578
01:47:24,571 --> 01:47:26,482
Plus, we are in a fix with Vishnu sir.

1579
01:47:26,539 --> 01:47:28,348
We trusted him with the money.

1580
01:47:28,408 --> 01:47:29,716
We came here from there...

1581
01:47:29,776 --> 01:47:30,777
only to sit like this?

1582
01:47:31,244 --> 01:47:32,245
Here also...

1583
01:47:33,279 --> 01:47:36,488
Guys, we are popular.

1584
01:47:37,183 --> 01:47:38,662
People know we dance well.

1585
01:47:39,719 --> 01:47:43,462
If we get a couple of days,
we can raise the money.

1586
01:47:44,390 --> 01:47:45,300
Right?

1587
01:47:45,358 --> 01:47:48,396
That means even after working so hard
we still have to beg?

1588
01:47:48,595 --> 01:47:49,471
Beggars? We are not... that.

1589
01:47:49,529 --> 01:47:53,534
That's not true... jeez...
Of course you guys are beggars.

1590
01:47:53,733 --> 01:47:56,475
That's why you have no
employment problems.

1591
01:47:56,536 --> 01:48:00,177
If you run out of jobs,
there's always begging.

1592
01:48:01,474 --> 01:48:03,283
Suru...
- Suru...

1593
01:48:03,343 --> 01:48:04,481
Listen...
- What?

1594
01:48:04,544 --> 01:48:05,648
Please leave us alone.

1595
01:48:06,613 --> 01:48:07,853
I'm requesting you to leave us alone.

1596
01:48:07,914 --> 01:48:10,520
Guys we are here to dance
not to fight.

1597
01:48:10,583 --> 01:48:12,688
Don't touch me...
- Don't you touch her...

1598
01:48:12,752 --> 01:48:13,730
You want to talk...
talk to me.

1599
01:48:13,786 --> 01:48:16,198
Suru... Suru!
Please...

1600
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:17,326
Please guys...

1601
01:48:17,624 --> 01:48:18,830
Move. Sorry.

1602
01:48:20,193 --> 01:48:20,864
Please.

1603
01:48:22,729 --> 01:48:23,673
Sorry.

1604
01:48:36,576 --> 01:48:37,611
I was selfish.

1605
01:48:38,878 --> 01:48:40,357
I came here...

1606
01:48:41,748 --> 01:48:43,193
with a vested interest.

1607
01:48:46,686 --> 01:48:49,462
For my son Ivlanu.

1608
01:48:50,890 --> 01:48:56,203
But because of you,
I not only got my son...

1609
01:48:57,697 --> 01:48:59,233
but also respect.

1610
01:49:00,266 --> 01:49:03,736
Which I could have
never gained by myself.

1611
01:49:04,370 --> 01:49:09,410
I can't do anything
about the family that left...

1612
01:49:09,776 --> 01:49:11,278
but the family...

1613
01:49:13,413 --> 01:49:14,756
that we have made now...

1614
01:49:16,215 --> 01:49:18,195
I don't want to lose it.

1615
01:49:20,787 --> 01:49:21,731
Sorry...

1616
01:49:22,789 --> 01:49:23,824
Sorry.

1617
01:49:25,792 --> 01:49:28,796
Sir, no. Please don't apologize.

1618
01:49:28,928 --> 01:49:30,464
You are our guru.

1619
01:50:05,398 --> 01:50:07,901
So girls... what's up?

1620
01:50:45,304 --> 01:50:47,648
God, I love Bollywood.
- Bollywood dance? I will teach you...

1621
01:50:47,707 --> 01:50:52,452
Hi, guys. Hi, Indian Stunners.

1622
01:50:53,646 --> 01:50:55,956
Hi, Vishnu sir. I am Pooja.
- Hi!

1623
01:50:56,215 --> 01:50:58,661
A big fan of yours
and Indian Stunners.

1624
01:50:59,585 --> 01:51:00,563
Get up.

1625
01:51:01,921 --> 01:51:03,798
Thank you. Thank you.

1626
01:51:04,290 --> 01:51:06,964
Actually, you don't need to
introduce yourselves...

1627
01:51:07,226 --> 01:51:08,671
I know all of you.

1628
01:51:09,395 --> 01:51:12,569
I have been staying in America
since many years.

1629
01:51:12,632 --> 01:51:15,442
I am so happy
to see you guys here.

1630
01:51:15,501 --> 01:51:17,503
I feel so proud to be an Indian.

1631
01:51:18,271 --> 01:51:19,443
Thank you,
- Thank you.

1632
01:51:19,505 --> 01:51:21,985
Actually, I have an Indian restaurant
called Nirvana

1633
01:51:22,742 --> 01:51:26,246
and that has the best
Indian food in Vegas.

1634
01:51:26,746 --> 01:51:29,818
I know you guys must be
dying to have Indian food.

1635
01:51:30,383 --> 01:51:31,225
Will we get Gujarati snacks there?

1636
01:51:31,284 --> 01:51:32,695
Of course.

1637
01:51:32,752 --> 01:51:34,322
So, why don't you come?

1638
01:51:36,589 --> 01:51:37,533
Next time.

1639
01:51:37,724 --> 01:51:39,704
Next time.
- Yes.

1640
01:51:39,759 --> 01:51:43,366
Oh, please let's go.
Come on. Please.

1641
01:51:43,429 --> 01:51:44,464
You like Indian food?

1642
01:51:44,530 --> 01:51:45,600
I love Indian...

1643
01:51:46,632 --> 01:51:48,305
Food. She likes Indian food.

1644
01:51:49,502 --> 01:51:50,310
Sir, let's go.

1645
01:51:50,369 --> 01:51:52,246
Please, sir. Let's go. Sir...

1646
01:51:52,305 --> 01:51:55,252
- They might have South Indian food too.
- Come on. There's never a next time.

1647
01:51:55,308 --> 01:51:56,787
Alright!
<i>'</i> Yes!

1648
01:51:57,310 --> 01:51:58,914
- Vernon, go on have some chicken.
Pass it here. Looks yummy!

1649
01:51:58,978 --> 01:52:00,548
- Enjoy, it is a party.
- I know.

1650
01:52:12,325 --> 01:52:13,827
Hi D! Hi, guys.

1651
01:52:13,893 --> 01:52:14,837
Hello...
- How's it going?

1652
01:52:14,894 --> 01:52:15,736
Hi.

1653
01:52:15,795 --> 01:52:17,001
Hi, Jack!
- Hi!

1654
01:52:18,297 --> 01:52:19,002
Sir...

1655
01:52:19,465 --> 01:52:20,409
Shall I leave?

1656
01:52:22,635 --> 01:52:23,670
Come.

1657
01:52:25,271 --> 01:52:25,749
Raghav?

1658
01:52:25,805 --> 01:52:26,943
We are going to be over there.

1659
01:52:27,206 --> 01:52:27,650
You guys sit here...

1660
01:52:27,707 --> 01:52:28,811
- We understand...

1661
01:52:29,709 --> 01:52:30,915
Come.
- Hi!

1662
01:52:31,911 --> 01:52:32,889
Hey!

1663
01:52:35,915 --> 01:52:37,189
Hi!
- Hi.

1664
01:52:37,683 --> 01:52:38,593
Do you work out?

1665
01:52:39,619 --> 01:52:40,791
Work out?
- Yes?

1666
01:52:40,853 --> 01:52:42,230
Where is the time?

1667
01:52:42,255 --> 01:52:44,735
We rehearse from the morning
until the evening... dancing...

1668
01:52:46,325 --> 01:52:48,430
Okay. Like the saying goes...

1669
01:52:48,494 --> 01:52:52,806
work is worship and
'Pooja' means worship.

1670
01:52:54,467 --> 01:52:55,810
Are you okay?
- Yes.

1671
01:52:55,835 --> 01:52:56,939
Yes?
- Dancing...

1672
01:52:56,969 --> 01:52:58,346
Yes...

1673
01:52:59,806 --> 01:53:00,443
Excuse me...

1674
01:53:00,506 --> 01:53:02,577
Excuse me, you say you are Indian'?

1675
01:53:02,809 --> 01:53:03,549
Yes.

1676
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:05,480
Is your mother Indian or your father?

1677
01:53:06,579 --> 01:53:07,751
Father... why do you ask?

1678
01:53:07,814 --> 01:53:08,815
That is why...

1679
01:53:08,881 --> 01:53:09,882
What do you mean, Suru?

1680
01:53:09,916 --> 01:53:12,226
That is why you do
not know how to eat.

1681
01:53:12,451 --> 01:53:15,432
If your mother were Indian,
she would have fed you with her hands.

1682
01:53:15,621 --> 01:53:16,793
You are meant to eat with your hands.

1683
01:53:16,823 --> 01:53:19,235
And the lentils and rice
are to be mixed and eaten.

1684
01:53:19,458 --> 01:53:21,438
You want me to put
my hands in the curry?

1685
01:53:21,494 --> 01:53:23,496
You mean, I actually need to
dip my hands in the curry?

1686
01:53:23,563 --> 01:53:25,634
Yes, put your hands in the curry.

1687
01:53:25,698 --> 01:53:27,473
No, let me show you.

1688
01:53:27,867 --> 01:53:28,868
Really.

1689
01:53:29,268 --> 01:53:32,841
If you eat with your hands, you will
be able to make right sized...

1690
01:53:34,841 --> 01:53:37,447
You know...
I mean... what's the word...?

1691
01:53:37,643 --> 01:53:38,621
Bite!

1692
01:53:39,912 --> 01:53:41,391
You are smart. Bite.

1693
01:53:41,781 --> 01:53:42,851
No, I am not doing that.

1694
01:53:42,915 --> 01:53:43,655
Take it.
- No. I am sorry.

1695
01:53:43,683 --> 01:53:45,924
Open your mouth. Olive.

1696
01:53:46,185 --> 01:53:46,686
Olive, just try it.

1697
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:48,527
If she doesn't want it,
why are you forcing her?

1698
01:53:48,554 --> 01:53:49,658
I am only feeding her.

1699
01:53:50,223 --> 01:53:51,327
If she doesn't want it,
why are you forcing her?

1700
01:53:51,390 --> 01:53:52,698
I am not forcing her.
She is a friend.

1701
01:53:52,758 --> 01:53:53,600
Suru.

1702
01:53:53,659 --> 01:53:54,535
What Suru?

1703
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:55,932
What will you do?
- What Will I do'?

1704
01:53:56,195 --> 01:53:57,367
What will you do?
- What Will I do'?

1705
01:53:57,396 --> 01:53:58,875
Tell me, what will you do?

1706
01:53:59,532 --> 01:54:00,374
She bites!

1707
01:54:00,433 --> 01:54:01,878
She's biting me!

1708
01:54:22,755 --> 01:54:27,670
As the wind touches you
I want to touch it

1709
01:54:27,727 --> 01:54:32,699
I don't wanna go on
And make castles in the sand

1710
01:54:32,765 --> 01:54:37,771
If you walk with me
The paths won't be lonely

1711
01:54:37,803 --> 01:54:42,877
I am gonna love you
Like no one ever can...

1712
01:54:43,843 --> 01:54:48,792
l-low long will I be alone'?

1713
01:54:48,848 --> 01:54:53,627
You know I need you by my side!

1714
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:58,869
Yes! l-low long will I live alone'?

1715
01:54:58,925 --> 01:55:02,429
One thing I have realized...

1716
01:55:02,495 --> 01:55:04,839
If you hold my hand

1717
01:55:04,897 --> 01:55:07,571
My world will change

1718
01:55:07,633 --> 01:55:09,840
If you hold my hand

1719
01:55:09,902 --> 01:55:12,610
I will have all the joy

1720
01:55:12,672 --> 01:55:14,982
If you hold my hand

1721
01:55:15,241 --> 01:55:17,619
My world will blossom

1722
01:55:17,677 --> 01:55:19,679
If you hold my hand

1723
01:55:20,246 --> 01:55:23,591
Oh Baby!
I'll never let you go.

1724
01:55:23,916 --> 01:55:28,422
O O O You calling out for me

1725
01:55:28,487 --> 01:55:32,697
O O O You got me on my knees

1726
01:55:32,758 --> 01:55:37,730
If I get you

1727
01:55:37,797 --> 01:55:42,906
I will treat you very dear

1728
01:55:42,935 --> 01:55:47,884
Baby, I'll be there for you forever

1729
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:52,753
I have been saying this
Time and again

1730
01:55:53,713 --> 01:55:58,219
If I get you

1731
01:55:58,284 --> 01:56:02,926
I will treat you very dearly

1732
01:56:03,289 --> 01:56:08,204
Baby, I'll be there for you forever

1733
01:56:08,260 --> 01:56:12,766
I have been saying this
Time and again

1734
01:56:14,900 --> 01:56:19,849
You don't know
l-low I need you

1735
01:56:19,872 --> 01:56:24,321
Like a bird that's looking for the sky

1736
01:56:24,977 --> 01:56:29,824
I know what I am without

1737
01:56:30,282 --> 01:56:33,491
Oh Baby!
I'm just another guy!

1738
01:56:33,552 --> 01:56:35,896
If you hold my hand

1739
01:56:35,921 --> 01:56:38,527
My world will change

1740
01:56:38,591 --> 01:56:40,867
If you hold my hand

1741
01:56:40,926 --> 01:56:43,566
I will have all the joy

1742
01:56:43,629 --> 01:56:45,939
If you hold my hand

1743
01:56:46,198 --> 01:56:48,644
My world will blossom

1744
01:56:48,667 --> 01:56:51,204
If you hold my hand

1745
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:54,513
Oh Baby!
I'll never let you go.

1746
01:56:54,540 --> 01:56:59,421
O O O You calling out for me

1747
01:56:59,478 --> 01:57:04,484
O O O You got me on my knees

1748
01:57:04,550 --> 01:57:09,624
O O O You calling out for me

1749
01:57:09,688 --> 01:57:13,898
O O O You got me on my knees,
for life!

1750
01:57:13,959 --> 01:57:16,496
If you hold my hand

1751
01:57:34,747 --> 01:57:35,919
- What a super hit move.

1752
01:57:40,252 --> 01:57:42,789
- Come closer, let me see.

1753
01:57:43,255 --> 01:57:44,632
- It's really funny.
- Oh my God!

1754
01:57:44,890 --> 01:57:46,335
- Raghav has lost it.

1755
01:57:51,197 --> 01:57:52,198
Suru.

1756
01:57:52,331 --> 01:57:53,776
Look at this.

1757
01:57:53,833 --> 01:57:54,811
I have shown you twice.

1758
01:57:54,834 --> 01:57:55,869
Two... two minutes.

1759
01:57:56,302 --> 01:57:56,939
One second.

1760
01:57:57,169 --> 01:57:58,273
Come on, Suru.

1761
01:57:58,337 --> 01:57:59,509
What is happening?

1762
01:58:00,306 --> 01:58:01,216
What is happening?

1763
01:58:01,273 --> 01:58:02,911
What are both of you doing?

1764
01:58:03,175 --> 01:58:04,245
Who two?

1765
01:58:04,610 --> 01:58:05,850
You and Olive.

1766
01:58:06,579 --> 01:58:08,616
Vinnie is feeling bad.
Look at her face.

1767
01:58:08,814 --> 01:58:10,259
Vinnie is feeling bad?

1768
01:58:10,916 --> 01:58:11,860
Vinnie?

1769
01:58:11,884 --> 01:58:12,862
Don't do all this.

1770
01:58:12,885 --> 01:58:13,886
Where are you taking me?

1771
01:58:13,953 --> 01:58:15,227
Let's clear things right away.

1772
01:58:15,254 --> 01:58:17,700
Vinnie, are you feeling
bad about anything?

1773
01:58:18,858 --> 01:58:19,666
No.

1774
01:58:19,725 --> 01:58:20,703
Vernon is saying that...

1775
01:58:22,461 --> 01:58:24,498
You aren't feeling bad about anything?

1776
01:58:25,598 --> 01:58:26,542
No.

1777
01:58:28,134 --> 01:58:30,341
When she feeds him, touches him

1778
01:58:30,402 --> 01:58:32,439
then your face falls.

1779
01:58:32,471 --> 01:58:34,382
Now that he is in front of you,
tell him.

1780
01:58:34,707 --> 01:58:35,583
Tell me, Vinnie.

1781
01:58:35,774 --> 01:58:36,252
Tell him.

1782
01:58:36,308 --> 01:58:37,378
He is just talking rubbish.

1783
01:58:37,443 --> 01:58:38,820
What is wrong with you!

1784
01:58:39,512 --> 01:58:41,583
Listen... you go to Olive.

1785
01:58:41,647 --> 01:58:43,490
I am going to Olive.
- Just a minute. Wait.

1786
01:58:43,649 --> 01:58:44,252
You go.

1787
01:58:44,283 --> 01:58:45,785
- Now I should go?

1788
01:58:46,719 --> 01:58:47,459
What are you showing her?

1789
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:49,261
Wait two minutes. Let me show her.

1790
01:58:49,455 --> 01:58:50,763
Who are you showing it to?
- What happened?

1791
01:58:50,823 --> 01:58:52,302
Something personal between them.
I don't know.

1792
01:58:52,491 --> 01:58:53,697
Yes! I am feeling bad...

1793
01:58:54,627 --> 01:58:56,368
that you two are getting close,
unnecessarily.

1794
01:58:56,395 --> 01:58:57,601
Why are you feeding her?

1795
01:58:58,931 --> 01:58:59,875
Feeding her...

1796
01:58:59,932 --> 01:59:02,276
We are rehearsing, so there is
bound to be contact.

1797
01:59:02,301 --> 01:59:03,609
Is this how rehearsals are done'?

1798
01:59:03,669 --> 01:59:04,875
What are you doing?
Everyone's watching.

1799
01:59:05,371 --> 01:59:06,406
Let them see!

1800
01:59:07,406 --> 01:59:09,545
I am not in love with her.

1801
01:59:09,575 --> 01:59:12,488
Why didn't you tell me if
you have feelings for me?

1802
01:59:12,545 --> 01:59:15,492
It is obvious to everyone.

1803
01:59:15,514 --> 01:59:17,391
Even Vinod can see it.
Why can't you?

1804
01:59:17,449 --> 01:59:18,826
No I can't. I'm blind!

1805
01:59:18,851 --> 01:59:20,956
Why don't you tell me?

1806
01:59:21,387 --> 01:59:22,331
Say it.

1807
01:59:22,354 --> 01:59:23,526
Do...

1808
01:59:24,256 --> 01:59:25,633
Do I need to tell you?

1809
01:59:31,330 --> 01:59:32,570
Why are you getting worked up?

1810
01:59:34,567 --> 01:59:35,739
You...

1811
01:59:37,236 --> 01:59:38,374
You know that...

1812
01:59:46,912 --> 01:59:49,290
You'll make her cry!

1813
01:59:49,348 --> 01:59:50,418
Hey, Suru...

1814
02:00:56,548 --> 02:00:57,492
Hold up!

1815
02:00:57,549 --> 02:01:01,861
For the first time in the history of
the World Starz hip-hop challenge...

1816
02:01:01,887 --> 02:01:03,389
two teams have the same points

1817
02:01:03,422 --> 02:01:05,902
but there's only
one spot in the finals.

1818
02:01:06,258 --> 02:01:09,262
This means they will be battling
it out tonight in a dance off.

1819
02:01:09,328 --> 02:01:13,606
This is huge for India as the
Philippine All Stars are their idols.

1820
02:01:16,568 --> 02:01:20,243
So, here we are finally
at the face off in Las Vegas.

1821
02:01:20,306 --> 02:01:22,547
And everybody is asking me
who my favorite is.

1822
02:01:22,608 --> 02:01:24,747
You know what...
both teams are my favourite.

1823
02:01:24,810 --> 02:01:27,689
First up, let's see what
the Philippine All Stars got for us.

1824
02:02:43,489 --> 02:02:45,435
That was amazing!

1825
02:02:48,927 --> 02:02:50,497
Come on boys... come on.

1826
02:02:51,296 --> 02:02:52,240
What happened?

1827
02:02:52,631 --> 02:02:54,770
Sir, they are very good.

1828
02:02:55,334 --> 02:02:56,472
Sir... how will we...

1829
02:02:56,702 --> 02:02:58,306
They are like our Gods.

1830
02:02:58,971 --> 02:03:01,383
I mean...
- They are not real Gods.

1831
02:03:01,907 --> 02:03:04,615
Now you dance for the real One.

1832
02:03:05,644 --> 02:03:12,254
You won't dance for them but
only for those, who look out for you.

1833
02:03:12,618 --> 02:03:13,722
Come on, Suru!

1834
02:03:13,919 --> 02:03:15,262
DO it!

1835
02:03:18,223 --> 02:03:24,572
Let's go for it!!

1836
02:03:33,439 --> 02:03:38,252
O Supreme Being!
Without you...

1837
02:03:38,310 --> 02:03:42,952
O Divinity
I am lost

1838
02:03:43,215 --> 02:03:47,789
O Supreme Being!
Without you...

1839
02:03:47,820 --> 02:03:52,633
O Divinity
I am lost

1840
02:03:52,691 --> 02:03:57,401
My dreams started taking shape

1841
02:03:57,463 --> 02:04:02,742
Shattered before it came true

1842
02:04:05,270 --> 02:04:13,280
My tasks are incomplete.
Please guide me.

1843
02:04:16,615 --> 02:04:26,229
Hail and salute you

1844
02:04:26,258 --> 02:04:35,906
Hail and salute you

1845
02:05:09,501 --> 02:05:11,879
Supreme Lord
The Lord known by many names

1846
02:05:11,937 --> 02:05:14,918
The one in many forms
Who wears the moon on his forehead

1847
02:05:19,211 --> 02:05:21,589
Supreme Lord
The Lord known by many names

1848
02:05:21,647 --> 02:05:23,888
The one in many forms
Who wears the moon on his forehead

1849
02:05:23,949 --> 02:05:26,395
The creators of the universe
All sing your praises

1850
02:05:26,451 --> 02:05:29,694
Superior Lord, the sky echoes
With the melodies of the percussion

1851
02:05:47,906 --> 02:05:52,582
Oh Lord!
This life is transient

1852
02:05:52,644 --> 02:05:56,717
It burns and melts in an instant

1853
02:05:56,748 --> 02:06:02,255
Oh Lord!
I am like a flickering lamp

1854
02:06:02,321 --> 02:06:06,736
My morale has started dwindling

1855
02:06:06,959 --> 02:06:09,530
Hope my steps don't halt

1856
02:06:09,561 --> 02:06:16,843
What will happen if the head
that has never bowed down

1857
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:25,686
Hail and salute you

1858
02:06:25,744 --> 02:06:30,921
Hail and salute you

1859
02:06:31,183 --> 02:06:35,723
Hail and salute you

1860
02:06:35,787 --> 02:06:40,736
Hail and salute you

1861
02:06:59,311 --> 02:07:03,282
Oh Lord
Hail the enlightened one!

1862
02:07:03,348 --> 02:07:05,624
A potent mantra
I chant this mantra

1863
02:07:05,651 --> 02:07:07,324
I respect your power

1864
02:07:07,386 --> 02:07:11,357
Everything starts with you
And ends with you

1865
02:07:11,423 --> 02:07:15,337
Truth, Life and Virtue
Hail the enlightened one!

1866
02:07:15,394 --> 02:07:17,396
Oh valorous Lord
Brave one

1867
02:07:17,429 --> 02:07:19,306
Nurturer of the helpless

1868
02:07:19,364 --> 02:07:23,335
Remover of hurdles
Creator as well as the destroyer

1869
02:07:23,402 --> 02:07:27,179
Provider of clear vision
The strongest being in the Universe

1870
02:07:27,205 --> 02:07:31,153
A potent mantra
I chant this mantra

1871
02:07:31,176 --> 02:07:34,646
I respect your power

1872
02:07:57,169 --> 02:08:00,446
Hey, we have made it to the finals.

1873
02:08:00,505 --> 02:08:03,714
We made it to the finals!
We won. We won. VVon...

1874
02:08:10,182 --> 02:08:10,717
Hey...

1875
02:08:10,782 --> 02:08:11,453
Come.

1876
02:08:11,516 --> 02:08:14,190
I had gone for two minutes.
They beat me again. Look.

1877
02:08:14,252 --> 02:08:15,754
Look at them. Come on. No.

1878
02:08:19,291 --> 02:08:20,634
What are you doing, D?

1879
02:08:20,892 --> 02:08:21,927
They are hitting me.
What are you doing?

1880
02:08:22,194 --> 02:08:23,264
You know how to slap, don't you'?

1881
02:08:23,762 --> 02:08:25,537
Then why did you wait
to be slapped four times?

1882
02:08:25,764 --> 02:08:27,607
Why didn't you hit me back
on the first one? Come.

1883
02:08:34,806 --> 02:08:35,443
Hey!

1884
02:08:41,446 --> 02:08:45,394
Stop. Stop. Calm down.

1885
02:08:45,650 --> 02:08:47,459
What happened?
- He slapped me.

1886
02:08:47,519 --> 02:08:48,395
He did?
- Yes.

1887
02:08:48,453 --> 02:08:50,160
Then hit him back!

1888
02:09:04,169 --> 02:09:07,446
Stop! Stop! Get up!

1889
02:09:07,506 --> 02:09:10,316
Now! Stop... Stop it!

1890
02:09:10,375 --> 02:09:13,481
Come on. Separate. Separate.

1891
02:09:13,912 --> 02:09:17,325
Get over there. Stop!
Take your breath.

1892
02:09:17,482 --> 02:09:18,460
Everybody.

1893
02:09:18,717 --> 02:09:21,425
I won't have this violence
in my competition.

1894
02:09:21,486 --> 02:09:22,487
You get it?

1895
02:09:22,554 --> 02:09:25,831
I spent ten years getting this garbage
out of hip-hop.

1896
02:09:26,258 --> 02:09:28,932
We won't go back.
Do you understand?

1897
02:09:29,194 --> 02:09:29,763
Yes.

1898
02:09:29,828 --> 02:09:32,536
Do you understand?
Say, 'yes'.

1899
02:09:32,597 --> 02:09:33,405
Yes.

1900
02:09:34,666 --> 02:09:36,703
Your team! Your team!

1901
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:38,441
You have one more chance.

1902
02:09:38,503 --> 02:09:41,382
You do it again,
you are out of the competition.

1903
02:09:42,307 --> 02:09:44,309
You boys want to show your muscle?

1904
02:09:44,376 --> 02:09:47,220
You show it out there.
Not here.

1905
02:09:48,246 --> 02:09:50,487
Now get out of here.
- Yes, sir!

1906
02:09:50,549 --> 02:09:53,655
Now, go!
Move!

1907
02:09:54,719 --> 02:09:55,823
Boys...

1908
02:09:57,289 --> 02:09:58,563
look our Suresh and Vernon.

1909
02:09:58,623 --> 02:10:00,432
Indian Stunners deserve it better.

1910
02:10:00,492 --> 02:10:03,268
This is their first time
but they did super duper great.

1911
02:10:03,562 --> 02:10:05,974
They deserve this because
I know it is from their heart.

1912
02:10:06,231 --> 02:10:07,710
Suresh?
- They know what they want to do.

1913
02:10:07,766 --> 02:10:11,646
To actually show the love for dance
and hip-hop in the whole wide world.

1914
02:10:11,703 --> 02:10:14,411
It is their first time.
But... respect.

1915
02:10:14,472 --> 02:10:15,712
Indian Stunners!

1916
02:10:18,610 --> 02:10:22,956
Victory to India!

1917
02:10:25,884 --> 02:10:27,955
One... two...

1918
02:10:28,220 --> 02:10:29,358
- Guys, hold on.

1919
02:10:29,387 --> 02:10:30,559
Three...

1920
02:10:33,825 --> 02:10:36,305
Jack, come.
- Wait, where are you going?

1921
02:10:37,395 --> 02:10:38,465
Thank you.

1922
02:10:39,431 --> 02:10:40,535
L-low are you doing now'?

1923
02:10:40,599 --> 02:10:42,306
L-low is your foot'?
- Okay.

1924
02:10:42,868 --> 02:10:43,710
Sit.

1925
02:10:44,269 --> 02:10:45,577
It is better than before.

1926
02:10:46,872 --> 02:10:48,818
It is better now. Thanks.

1927
02:10:49,941 --> 02:10:51,477
Listen, Vinnie...

1928
02:10:52,878 --> 02:10:54,482
I just didn't know...

1929
02:10:55,714 --> 02:10:59,321
I mean, that you and Suru...

1930
02:10:59,618 --> 02:11:00,688
I mean...

1931
02:11:01,553 --> 02:11:02,998
were childhood friends.

1932
02:11:03,855 --> 02:11:05,892
And I unnecessarily came in between.

1933
02:11:07,392 --> 02:11:09,531
I am sorry I got carried away.

1934
02:11:12,264 --> 02:11:13,572
I am the one who should apologize.

1935
02:11:14,266 --> 02:11:15,677
Suru is like that.

1936
02:11:15,700 --> 02:11:17,577
Everyone falls in love with him.

1937
02:11:19,371 --> 02:11:20,008
Thanks, Vinnie.

1938
02:11:20,272 --> 02:11:22,343
I just wanted to clear this.

1939
02:11:22,607 --> 02:11:24,587
I was your replacement here.

1940
02:11:24,643 --> 02:11:26,850
And now, when you get okay...

1941
02:11:27,279 --> 02:11:29,919
before I go,
I wanted to tell you everything.

1942
02:11:30,282 --> 02:11:31,693
Before you go?

1943
02:11:31,750 --> 02:11:33,229
Where are you going to go?

1944
02:11:33,551 --> 02:11:36,293
We have reached here because of you.

1945
02:11:36,554 --> 02:11:39,398
And when we move ahead in
the competition, you will be with us.

1946
02:11:39,691 --> 02:11:41,534
You are a part of Indian Stunners now.

1947
02:11:41,826 --> 02:11:43,931
Yes.
- Yes... Yes!

1948
02:12:16,361 --> 02:12:17,738
From the disgraced copycats...

1949
02:12:17,862 --> 02:12:19,273
to the meek underdogs.

1950
02:12:19,331 --> 02:12:22,778
For the first time India takes part
in such an international arena...

1951
02:12:22,834 --> 02:12:24,541
and is now at the top!

1952
02:12:24,602 --> 02:12:26,309
Making us so proud of them.

1953
02:12:34,546 --> 02:12:36,890
I would always tell him...
that he's a winner!

1954
02:12:36,948 --> 02:12:38,757
Just do it! Move aheadl!

1955
02:12:39,217 --> 02:12:39,854
Look at him now.

1956
02:12:39,918 --> 02:12:42,899
Blessings to Team Indian Stunners.

1957
02:12:52,931 --> 02:12:56,310
They defeated the same team
they had copied from.

1958
02:12:56,368 --> 02:12:59,906
Amazing! They made us proud.
So, Indian Stunners... go for it!

1959
02:12:59,971 --> 02:13:01,382
Well done Indian Stunners...

1960
02:13:01,406 --> 02:13:03,545
All the very best...
make India proud.

1961
02:13:12,550 --> 02:13:16,760
We are the youth of Punjab...

1962
02:13:16,988 --> 02:13:20,561
Wherever we live... India or America

1963
02:13:20,625 --> 02:13:24,437
If we dance the l-lip-l-lop
or the Bangra...

1964
02:13:24,496 --> 02:13:28,205
We'll will win every battle!

1965
02:13:42,414 --> 02:13:44,655
We are right in the middle
of the Grand Finale...

1966
02:13:44,716 --> 02:13:47,697
of the World Starz Hip Hop Challenge.

1967
02:13:47,752 --> 02:13:51,894
Let me hear you make some noise!

1968
02:13:51,956 --> 02:13:54,334
Louder!

1969
02:13:54,392 --> 02:13:56,872
Are we ready for the ne><t performance?

1970
02:13:57,695 --> 02:13:58,833
Alright!

1971
02:14:47,312 --> 02:14:49,451
Right ne><t... we got Team Recycle.

1972
02:14:49,514 --> 02:14:50,754
Defending champions...

1973
02:14:50,815 --> 02:14:53,694
Let me see you...
All the way from Germany!

1974
02:16:48,199 --> 02:16:52,204
No contest is complete
without an underdog story...

1975
02:16:52,537 --> 02:16:53,948
And in this contest...

1976
02:16:54,205 --> 02:16:57,243
I think we got one of the finest
underdog stories we ever had.

1977
02:16:57,775 --> 02:17:02,588
These guys coming up ne><t are
in this contest for the first time!

1978
02:17:02,714 --> 02:17:05,786
Putting their country
on the hip hop map!

1979
02:17:06,284 --> 02:17:09,356
First time in the contest
they go through the qualifiers...

1980
02:17:09,420 --> 02:17:10,899
Go through the quarters...

1981
02:17:10,955 --> 02:17:15,734
go through the semis where
they had to face their inspiration...

1982
02:17:15,793 --> 02:17:19,297
- The Philippine All Stars in a dance off!
- Let's do this!

1983
02:17:19,631 --> 02:17:22,237
- And now... raring to go...

1984
02:17:22,300 --> 02:17:23,802
Hey you! Indian Stunners, right?

1985
02:17:23,868 --> 02:17:25,370
Go! Go! Go!

1986
02:17:25,436 --> 02:17:26,471
Come on, boys!

1987
02:17:26,838 --> 02:17:27,748
Come on, Suru!

1988
02:17:27,805 --> 02:17:29,250
Come on, boys!

1989
02:17:29,741 --> 02:17:31,220
Come on, everyone!

1990
02:17:32,744 --> 02:17:33,848
What happened?

1991
02:17:40,752 --> 02:17:45,667
Only your name stands for the truth

1992
02:17:51,629 --> 02:17:57,307
Only your name is the truth

1993
02:17:57,368 --> 02:18:01,612
And calls out your name dear Mother!

1994
02:18:02,206 --> 02:18:07,918
You are my identity

1995
02:18:08,179 --> 02:18:11,456
My world, my Mother!

1996
02:18:12,750 --> 02:18:17,790
I will put my life on the line
For you a hundred times

1997
02:18:18,423 --> 02:18:23,372
I will put my life on the line
For you a hundred times

1998
02:18:23,561 --> 02:18:27,566
I can sacrifice anything
for you, Mother!

1999
02:18:30,535 --> 02:18:35,609
Mother, I salute thee!

2000
02:18:36,140 --> 02:18:41,317
Mother, I salute thee!

2001
02:18:41,379 --> 02:18:46,419
Mother, I salute thee!

2002
02:18:46,651 --> 02:18:51,896
Mother, I salute thee!

2003
02:19:03,267 --> 02:19:05,269
The biggest moment of my life

2004
02:19:05,336 --> 02:19:07,816
Yes! Just a few steps away

2005
02:19:07,872 --> 02:19:09,613
Yes! I have been waiting for so long

2006
02:19:09,674 --> 02:19:10,744
For this evening

2007
02:19:10,808 --> 02:19:13,516
Now, watch what he will do

2008
02:19:13,578 --> 02:19:16,252
Who bows down to none

2009
02:19:16,314 --> 02:19:19,227
Sit and enjoy

2010
02:19:19,283 --> 02:19:21,729
Even if I walk straight

2011
02:19:21,786 --> 02:19:24,426
I am a sure shot winner

2012
02:19:24,489 --> 02:19:26,935
I am indebted to my motherland

2013
02:19:27,191 --> 02:19:29,797
I will defeat and win over you

2014
02:19:29,861 --> 02:19:32,432
Whatever I have promised

2015
02:19:32,497 --> 02:19:34,977
I am from India

2016
02:19:35,233 --> 02:19:37,770
Hold on tight I am coming
with my might To fight and conquer

2017
02:19:37,802 --> 02:19:40,442
Wherever you have come from,
Whomever you may be

2018
02:19:40,505 --> 02:19:42,985
My conquest will take place right here

2019
02:19:43,241 --> 02:19:48,247
I will put our flag of victory there.

2020
02:20:16,274 --> 02:20:18,754
Whether I win or lose

2021
02:20:18,810 --> 02:20:21,484
I will show you

2022
02:20:21,546 --> 02:20:24,254
Mother is my Lord

2023
02:20:24,315 --> 02:20:26,727
There is no other shrine

2024
02:20:26,784 --> 02:20:29,424
I will dance,
I am crazed

2025
02:20:29,487 --> 02:20:32,195
I will dance,
My heart is helpless

2026
02:20:32,256 --> 02:20:34,702
This evening

2027
02:20:34,759 --> 02:20:37,296
My Mother will watch

2028
02:20:37,361 --> 02:20:39,841
Whether I win or lose

2029
02:20:39,897 --> 02:20:42,707
My Mother will be watching

2030
02:20:43,968 --> 02:20:45,606
I have to dance

2031
02:20:46,571 --> 02:20:47,914
I have to dance

2032
02:20:48,272 --> 02:20:49,307
Mother

2033
02:20:49,373 --> 02:20:50,716
I have to dance

2034
02:20:50,775 --> 02:20:54,279
My Mother will be watching

2035
02:20:54,479 --> 02:21:00,361
Saffron like the valour

2036
02:21:00,885 --> 02:21:06,392
Green like tender blossoms

2037
02:21:08,259 --> 02:21:13,504
White like clean intentions

2038
02:21:14,765 --> 02:21:20,010
These three colours are
Dearer than life itself

2039
02:21:21,005 --> 02:21:26,455
These three colours are
Dearer than life itself

2040
02:21:27,512 --> 02:21:32,552
My Mother's colour

2041
02:21:32,617 --> 02:21:34,790
Of every good

2042
02:21:34,852 --> 02:21:37,423
Mother, Mother, Mother

2043
02:21:37,788 --> 02:21:40,598
Colour of your tradition

2044
02:21:40,658 --> 02:21:43,298
Colour of your beloved

2045
02:21:43,361 --> 02:21:48,538
Colour of your victory

2046
02:21:48,599 --> 02:21:51,307
l-low can I repay

2047
02:21:51,369 --> 02:21:53,849
Your debt

2048
02:21:53,905 --> 02:21:58,752
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

2049
02:21:59,343 --> 02:22:04,588
Until my last breath

2050
02:22:04,649 --> 02:22:10,224
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

2051
02:22:10,288 --> 02:22:14,759
Only your name stands for the truth

2052
02:22:19,764 --> 02:22:28,411
Mother, I salute thee!

2053
02:22:36,380 --> 02:22:41,659
Rich with thy hurrying streams
Bright with orchard gleams

2054
02:22:41,852 --> 02:22:47,700
Rich with thy hurrying streams
Bright with orchard gleams

2055
02:22:49,627 --> 02:22:55,305
Rich with thy hurrying streams
Bright with orchard gleams

2056
02:22:55,366 --> 02:23:00,543
Rich with thy hurrying streams
Bright with orchard gleams

2057
02:23:00,838 --> 02:23:06,789
Rich with thy hurrying streams
Bright with orchard gleams

2058
02:23:17,421 --> 02:23:23,428
O Mother

2059
02:23:28,766 --> 02:23:33,476
O Mother

2060
02:24:52,650 --> 02:24:57,656
Only your name stands for the truth

2061
02:25:54,411 --> 02:25:59,520
Let's go for it!!

2062
02:26:48,265 --> 02:26:53,738
Glory of moonlight dreams

2063
02:26:53,804 --> 02:26:59,220
Over thy branches and lordly streams

2064
02:26:59,276 --> 02:27:06,592
Clad in thy blossoming trees

2065
02:27:09,753 --> 02:27:12,461
Laughing low and sweet

2066
02:27:12,523 --> 02:27:18,201
Rich with thy hurrying streams
Bright with orchard gleams

2067
02:27:18,262 --> 02:27:23,507
Rich with thy hurrying streams
Bright with orchard gleams

2068
02:27:32,643 --> 02:27:38,616
Victory!

2069
02:27:39,783 --> 02:27:44,254
O Victory to thee!

2070
02:27:48,259 --> 02:27:50,239
Whenever I would hurt
myself as a child...

2071
02:27:50,561 --> 02:27:51,767
my mother would say...

2072
02:27:52,496 --> 02:27:54,203
take your ne><t step carefully.

2073
02:27:55,366 --> 02:27:57,642
You should always focus
on the ne><t step.

2074
02:28:00,504 --> 02:28:02,882
We couldn't win the
competition at Vegas...

2075
02:28:03,707 --> 02:28:05,618
but we definitely learned...

2076
02:28:05,943 --> 02:28:08,253
that every effort made in truth...

2077
02:28:08,612 --> 02:28:10,751
is greater than winning or losing.

2078
02:28:12,516 --> 02:28:14,792
And every step in
the right direction...

2079
02:28:14,852 --> 02:28:16,832
is a goal in itself.

2080
02:28:19,690 --> 02:28:20,964
After all...

2081
02:28:21,558 --> 02:28:23,435
life is all about the ne><t step.

You go sleep. - Yes.

6

Sleep peacefully if you want!

7
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,427
Because I am awake!

8
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,197
No matter how hard sensations
try to spear through the silence,

9
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,460
We won't let you scream...

10
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:21,995
We have a sharp eye
on every news every hour.

11
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:25,066
Right now,
a killer is roaming this city..

12
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,379
""who looks sober,
but is ruthless by nature.

13
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:32,315
He might be advancing towards
your house in a red car.

14
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:33,977
He enters the house""

15
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,384
..when the owner of the house exits.

16
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:38,453
Chakradhar, sir!

17
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,587
Feels like you simply jumped
out of the television.

18
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,585
Do you really not sleep?
- That's the point.

19
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,588
I stay awake even when I am sleeping.

20
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,529
Where's Samrat? - I don't know.

21
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,129
After 11V; cups of
coffee and 1V2 cigarette..

22
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:54,536
..and he suddenly left.

23
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,974
He's been murmuring
'Fed up Fed up' since morning.

24
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,506
Fed up!

25
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,313
Oh...that's the point.

26
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,544
Now I know where he is and why?

27
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,556
Christa!

28
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,421
Christa!

29
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,293
Christa!

30
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:25,560
Christa!

31
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,566
Christa!

32
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,568
Christa!

33
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:36,377
Christa!

34
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,577
Christa!

35
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,075
Fight.

36
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,510
Come on, come on, hit me.

37
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,378
Move aside.

38
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,513
Move aside.

39
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,149
Move, move.

40
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:51,893
100 for 10.

41
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:52,930
Stop all this. - 100 for 10.

42
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,021
Stop this fight between
a rhino and a rabbit.

43
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,535
This game will stop
only after one of the two is dead.

44
00:05:58,825 --> 00:05:59,530
The rate's 100 for 10.

45
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,198
You bet too!

46
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:06,902
Oh shut up!

47
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,537
One. - Christa. Christa.

48
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,110
Two. - Christa. Christa.

49
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,373
Christa.

50
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,978
<i>Three. ~ Christa. Christa.</i>

51
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:16,547
Christa.

52
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,550
Move aside. Move.

53
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,388
Five.

54
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,129
Six. - Christa. Christa.

55
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,088
Samrat!

56
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,198
Samrat!

57
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,863
Seven. - Christa. Christa.

58
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,039
Christa.

59
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:43,406
Eight. - Christo. Christo.

60
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,352
Christopher!

61
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,086
Come on. Fight.

62
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:56,616
Its payback time.

63
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:58,220
Name: Christopher Barrett.

64
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,662
Three times Heavy Weight champion.

65
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,328
Unbeatable since 10 matches.
<i>7</i> knockouts.

66
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,656
Ego solid, but breakable.

67
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,029
Strong point: Right leg,
right punch and eyesight.

68
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:07,634
Weak point: Abdomen.

69
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,164
Recently been operated.

70
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:11,533
And now... the four steps of success.

71
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,344
First: Tell his ego to go to he**.

72
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,252
And his anger will drag him along.

73
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,953
Second: Attack his strong point.

74
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:35,996
Everything's fair in love and war..

75
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,263
..because there's no
second prize in both.

76
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,704
Now for the third degree.

77
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,708
Even zero degree ice..

78
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:53,944
..can't soothe the
pain of my third degree.

79
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,613
And losers always face this brunt.

80
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,457
One. - Come on, come on, come on.

81
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:11,828
Two.

82
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:14,838
Three.

83
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,340
Foun

84
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:19,910
Out.

85
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,910
And that's a knock out!

86
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,071
Knock out!

87
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:25,010
And the winner is Samrat Ti
akdhari!!

88
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,449
Friends, the next match is between
famous kick boxer Rajesh Marathe..

89
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:34,452
..and five time body-building
champion Martin D'souza.

90
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,460
The match starts in 15 minutes.

91
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,057
The betting has started.

92
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,252
Excuse me.

93
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,060
Your prize money.

94
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,132
You know where to deliver it.

95
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,429
You always donate your
prize money in charity.

96
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,033
Any special reason?

97
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,800
Madam, even reason
doesn't reason with STD.

98
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:55,377
STD? - Samrat Tilakdhari.

99
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,004
What question was
bothering you today..

100
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,012
..that you had to enter the ring?

101
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,980
The answer to some questions""

102
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,580
""are more questions.

103
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,650
You and your Samrat-ism.

104
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,218
You're offered so many cases
why don't you pick one?

105
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,653
They may be cases for you..

106
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,485
""but to me they are an insult.

107
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:46,589
What do you want me to?

108
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,498
Find Rocky's doggy?

109
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,058
Or..prove Mrs.
Sharma's affair with Mr.Verma..

110
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,158
""for suspicious Mr. Sharma.

111
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:58,536
I wonder what case you're waiting for
which is going to sweep u off your feet...

112
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,727
This gorgeous lady who wears a red
nail paint and red lipstick""

113

""loves the color of red blood.

Beware. Keep your eyes wide open.

Is this lady stalking you?

116
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,700
For now, Chakradhar bids you adieu.

117
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,137
We'll meet again next week""

118
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,776
..in 'Chakradhar's Chakravuyhâ
with a new story.

119
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,912
The gorgeous lethal beauty! - What?

120
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,020
Red nail paint. Pink lipstick.

121
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:43,951
This is confusing...

122
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,121
What rubbish?

123
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,054
Is this Samrat Ti
akdhari's house?

124
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,585
She's asking for the right person
that means she isn't that girl.

125
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,986
Yes, this is his house.
Come in please.

126
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,092
What did you say your name was?

127
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,364
I didn't say that yet.
I am saying it now.

128
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:57,630
Dimpy Singh.

129
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,633
Will you please call him?
- Yes, yes, yes.

130
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,097
Please take a seat.

131
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,946
Don't be scared, it's dead.

132
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,313
Skulls are more dangerous
when they are alive.

133
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,142
First the beautiful
valleys of Shim
a..

134
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,147
âThen the skies of Delhi..

135
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,717
..and now Mumbai's traffic.

136
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,279
The journey must have been tiring.

137
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:52,979
Here.

138
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,787
How did you guess?

139
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,655
I think we're meeting
for the first time?

140
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,496
Do you need to meet
someone to know them?

141
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,563
And anyway,
I don't know much about you.

142
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,567
Except that you're the
daughter of an aristocrat""

143
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:06,996
""who lives in a town close to Shimla.

144
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,437
Your morning starts
with a cup of black coffee.

00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,562
You read the Hindustan Times.

146
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,164
You used to wear glasses""

147
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,336
..but recently you
underwent a Laser Surgery.

You've been in a relationship""

..and you're also confused.

151
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,881
Not because the boy is poor,

152
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,584
But because your
family doesn't like him.

153
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,250
But your reason for coming here""

154
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,412
..is a family matter for which..

155
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,453
..you can't approach the police.

156
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,319
You don't want anyone
to know anything""

""not even that you're here.

Your return flight's
for today evening.

159

And by the way,
you play the guitar quite well.

160
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:34,529
Right?

161
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,100
How the he**

162
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,659
How the he** did you guess that?

163
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,203
Any 6th sense? - 7th.

164
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,106
Samrat Tilakdhari.

165
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,243
Dimpy Singh.

166
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,547
So, Dimpy... how can I help you?

167
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,152
It's an unusual mystery. - Mystery!

168
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,548
That's the point.

169
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,987
Then you rang the right doorbell.

170
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,994
Because mysteries
are his only friends.

171
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:10,030
Only condition is that
they should be confusing.

172
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:13,533
Butmbefore any mystery""

173
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,196
""here's a sugar-free good news.

174
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,833
111 people now watch your show.

00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,771
No one can give you anything.

176
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,646
No surprise,
shock, happiness or any emotion.

177
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,915
By the way, he is..
- I've seen him on television.

178
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,818
'Chakradhar's Chakravuy'.

179
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,883
Right? - See. See.

180
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,019
She's seen my show.

181
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,087
I am the producer,
director, writer, editor..

..anchor.. - Satellite,

and now except for 112 audiences,
everything else.

184
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,659
But my real introduction
is that I am Watson.

185
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:48,594
What son?

186
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,975
Not what son, Watson.

187
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,935
Sherlock Holmes, Watson.

188
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,401
That's the point.

189
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,340
Actually,
in his free time he lends me a hand.

190
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,244
So you were mentioning some mystery.

191
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:01,210
Yes.

192
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,246
Oh yes.

193
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:07,551
Actually, there's a
huge garden in our bungalow.

194
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,885
And for the past month""

195

...all the trees and
plants are slowly withering.

196

That's the point.

197
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:18,134
Madam, if Samrat grows
you another garden""

198
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,031
""what will the gardener do?

It's like you're trying to learn
maths from Shakespeare.

Please hear me out.

201
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,945
We approached the best
gardeners and horticulturists.

But no one could understand anything.

203

We also conducted a forensic
analysis of the mud.

204
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:35,611
But there's no problem.

205
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,980
And then...last week
papa's horse suddenly died.

206
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,922
And we couldn't find
a reason for that either.

207
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:47,226
Now tell me... How can I approach
the police with such a strange case?

208
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,197
First garden, then the horse.

209
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,833
You mean first gardener
and then a veterinarian.

210
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,467
Please go ahead.

211
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,308
Actually, few months ago""

212
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,742
..papa fired his oldest gardener.

213
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,209
He was accused of stealing.

214
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,840
And before leaving,
that gardener bedamned us.

215
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,919
I've raised this garden
with my blood and sweat.

216
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,148
And after I die...the plants and trees..

217
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,284
âWill slowly wither away.

218
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,154
That will be the
evidence of my innocence.

219
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,922
And last week your gardener
passed away. - Yes!

220
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,196
Yes.

221
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,867
And since then this string
of misfortunes started.

222
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:31,068
Everyone believes that his ghost...
- Sorry, Miss. Dimpy.

223
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,233
You've brought the wrong
case to the right place.

224
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:35,945
Not interested.

225
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,044
CD...hail a cab for her.

226
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:39,641
Listen.

227
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,480
I'll give you the
number of a witch-doctor.

228
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,951
It's not about the garden,
it's about my father...

229
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,722
Father has not been keeping well.

230
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,460
And the doctors say..

231
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,531
""he has no physical illness.

232
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,128
Does he believe in ghosts and spirits?

233
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:02,564
Earlier he did not...

234
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:04,566
But I guess now he does""

235
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,668
Because strange things
are happening around him.

236
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,106
He doesn't talk to anyone.

237
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,004
He's scared all the time.

238
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,915
The lights in his
room stay on all night.

239
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:19,080
Actually... papa's in the
same condition as the garden.

240
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,048
They both are withering away...

241
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:27,497
Did that light a fuse?

242
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:31,826
Yes, brother.

243
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:33,893
I am sorry I didn't
inform you earlier.

244
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,101
Yes. Actually he's with me.

245
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:38,075
Okay, brother, I'll see you soon.

246
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,578
You can ask me what you want to.

247
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:51,419
Yes.

248
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,448
I was wondering""

249
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,459
I mean...how does your 7th sense work?

250
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,462
That 7th sense is called Samrat-ism.

251
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,830
Samrat-ism?

252
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,331
Einstein used only 11% of his brain.

253
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,399
It's nothing but observation.

254
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,631
Posh branded purse, glares, watch""

255
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:12,842
..a sign of richness.

256
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:16,073
But using it carelessly,
a sign of aristocracy.

257
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,082
Few days ago,
my interview was published..

258
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,077
..in Hindustan Times Delhi edition""

259
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:21,377
""regarding the case
I solved in Noida..

260
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,441
..the article didn't have
my phone number, but my address.

261
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,079
So you didn't call, you came directly.

262
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,656
Recently you underwent laser surgery.

263
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,090
Your eyes are perfectly fine now.

264
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,122
But still back in my house
while reading the magazine..

265
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,921
âHabitually your fingers
reached up to your foreheadâ.

266
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,565
""looking for your glasses.

267
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,567
The fingers on your right
hand are very beautiful.

268
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,431
But the tips on your
left hand fingers..

269
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,232
""are a bit coarse,
which is often what guitarists have.

270
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,435
Excuse me, sir. Juice. - No, thanks.

271
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,739
No.

272
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,674
But I am from Himacha
..
- The tag on your handbag.

273
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:50,675
It showed that you
took a flight from Shimla.

274
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:52,445
When you were taking
your mobile phone..

275
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,376
..out of your purse,
I noticed your car keys.

276
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,820
Driving all the way to Shimla,
without a driven.

277
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,184
""meant you didn't
want anyone to know""

278
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,552
..about your trip and it's reason.

279
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,151
And no luggage means,
return flight in the evening.

280
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,653
But the luggage could be
in the hotel as well. - No ways.

281
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,223
You were so eager to meet me..

282
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,095
..that you didn't
even wait at the airport.

283
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,728
In fact, you touched
up your lipstick in the taxi.

284
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,297
And due to the road
conditions of Mumbai..

285
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:16,162
..it smudged a bit,
and though you tried to clean it..

286
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,633
..you couldn't.

287
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,076
Okay.

288
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,374
And... about my about relationship?

289
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:24,906
Your phone.

290
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:26,709
This mobile phone is like a blemish..

291
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,581
..on your beautiful personality
and it's 6 months old.

292
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,577
And it's not a gift
from any family member..

293
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:32,413
""but a memorabilia
of a struggler boyfriend""

294
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,385
""because you still have it.

295
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,588
And the scratches on it..

296

âReveal your confusion

297
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:39,957
Amazing.

298
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,126
I thought you were just guessing.

299
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:43,891
I hate guessing.

300
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,264
I love to be sure.

301
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:51,031
Madam, his name...STD,
has another meaning.

302
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:54,840
'Sharp Teekhi Drishti'.
Meaning a piercing eyesight.

303
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,471
Good evening,
this is your captain Vikrant Parmar.

304
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,713
We should be landing
in the next 20 minutes.

305
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:00,178
The weather outside is pleasant""

306
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,179
..and the temperature
is 14 degree celcius.

307

Shimla isn't too far now.

308
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,047
Flight attendants,
prepare for landing please.

309
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,115
Thank you.

310
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,154
There's something in the air...

311
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:43,758
Definitely.

312
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,122
Samrat.

313
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,461
He's my eldest brother Sanjay Singh.

314
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,363
Samrat. - Welcome, Samrat.

315
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:51,734
Thank you.

316

And that's.. - Your second
brother Vijay Singh, and..

317
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:02,103
...he'll make an unsuccessful effort
to drive me away.

Hari. - Yes, sir.

319
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,713
Put his luggage back into the car.
- Yes, sir.

00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:07,107
Brother.

321
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:09,519
We don't need any detective here.

we need a detective""

325

Fire! Fire!

Come quickly.
Get water.

327
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,625
Fast!

328

Hurry up!
Quickly.

Get more water quickly.
Come on.

Get water.
Throw water quickly.

331
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,102
Brother, careful.

332
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,935
Hurry UP!

333
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,435
Throw the water.

334
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,371
Throw the water, Shiv.

335
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,972
There's an old truth that love,
cough and crime are difficult to hide.

336
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,775
But I can hide your secrets.

337
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:39,342
What?

338
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:41,344
What secrets?

339
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,210
There's no smoke without fire,
Mr. Vijay.

340
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,856
The name of the gorgeous
who's perfume you're smelling of..

341
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,620
..or the jockey you secretly bet on...

342
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,618
They can remain a secret.

343
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,323
More water.

344
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,956
Throw more water.

345
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,132
What's going on here?

346
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,563
I don't get it.

347
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,107
I guess someone's jinxed this house.

348
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,239
Half the servants have already
fled fearing a ghost.

349

And the rest""

350

Anyway, Vijay,
you were saying that we""

No, brother...I..

352

I have no problem with him.

353
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:24,917
Actually...I'm concerned
about papa's reaction.

354
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,597
No, no need to tell
papa that he's a detective.

355
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,867
He's Dimpy friend,
and he's from Mumbai.

356
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,121
There are more things
in Heaven and earth""

357

""than in your philosophy.

358
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,652
William Shakespeare,
Hamlet, Act 1 Scene 5.

Oh...

360
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:01,792
Dimpy told me about you.

361
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:08,028
But she didn't say
that... you're an encyclopedia.

362
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,234
I apologize sir,
I haven't read Hamlet.

363

I just read the quotes
along with the writers namesâ.

Good speed.

Sit.

368
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:32,023
Do you know the story behind this pen?

369

May I?

370
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,933
Plucked from a bird's
wing and turned into a pen.

371
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,969
Wrong.

372
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:47,277
As a pen it made it's era immortal.

373
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,105
It's a special antique.

374
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,208
Invaluable.

375
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,111
William Shakespeare
used to write with this pen.

376
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:01,216
Around 500 years ago.

377

Macbeth, Othello...

Anywaymto come back to the quote.

382

The eyes see only what our mind knows.

Welcome...

384
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,518
But with a request.

385
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:43,929
You're here as a friend,
so behave like one.

386
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:48,203

Dimpy's version and
the Mahendra Pratap we met..

00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:02,145
..are as different
as chalk and cheese.

390
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,148
And how did he know you're STD?

391
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:06,615
From the same Hindustan
Times article..

392
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:08,214
""from where Dimpy got my address.

393
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,483
It was on the top of the rack.

394

Come, Samrat.

395
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:14,287
Let me introduce you.

396
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:15,093
Mr. Agnihotri. - Hello.

397
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:16,155
Mr. Agnihotri, this is Samrat.

398
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:17,857
Mr. Agnihotri is our horticulturist.

399
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,535
Mr. Agnihotri,
do you believe in ghosts?

400
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:26,271
I didn't earlier.

401
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,869
But now I feel that...

402
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:33,516
..where nature ends,
the supernatural begins.

403
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,522
She's my younger sister, Divya.

404
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,025
""Life's filled with questions.""

405
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,121
She's been like this
since her childhood.

406
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:50,496
""It's hazy all around.""

407
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,501
Filled with a void.

408
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:55,372
Lost in herself.

409
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,205
""Who are these eyes looking for?""

410
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:59,139
She's also undergoing treatment.

411
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:00,501
Psychiatric.

412
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,043
""There's a fog all around.""

413

""There's a whisper.""

414
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:23,063
""Why does loneliness
kindle a flame within?""

415
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,942
This is a 2 week old recording.

416
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,041
Some claim that they've seen
this ghost with their own eyes.

417
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:41,243
What? They have? - Yes.

418
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:43,253
Samrat, let's leave this
haunted house right now. Please.

419
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:44,379
Let's go.

420
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,084
And listen,
I'll really give you the number..

421
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,522
..of a witch-doctor.

422

He's a big tantric. Call him.

423

Sir, the one sitting close to the Baba..

430
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,241
Your boss Mahendra Pratap Singh.

431
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,171
On the left are Vijay
and his wife Revati.

432
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,103
On the right are Sanjay
Singh and his wife Sunita.

433
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:44,237
In the middle, their sister Divya.

434
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:45,879
The one at the back is Puran kaka.

435
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,315
That's Shanti, Puran kaka's daughter.

436
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,176
And Rani, her assistant.

437
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,921
Sir, Dimpy ma'am told
me to tell you about everyone.

438
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:56,557
But already you know everything.

439
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:58,225
Your Dimpy ma'am told me.

440
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:12,305
But...she didn't tell me about him.

441
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,669
Who is he? - Sir, he's Deepak.

442
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,941
He's a manager in the boss' company.

443
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,287
And. . .these two?

444
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,279
Sir, that's Mrs.
Narayani and Mr. Kishore.

445
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,756
The neighbors.

446
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,122
They shifted here two months back.

447
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,286
Sir, Mr. Kishore loves
antiques like our boss.

448
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,097
That's why they got along really well.

449
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:38,895
Who told you that's the
reason for their friendship?

450
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:40,261
Sir...

451
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:41,331
Relax. That IS the reason.

452
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:07,258
I've liberated this
place from the evil spirit.

453
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:11,527
Now it will never trouble anyone.

454
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,127
Just remember one thing.

455
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:18,369
Don't let anyone untie this knot.

456
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,868
Tomorrow at dawn,
if any bud blossoms here""

457

that the curse has been lifted.

Hail God!

459
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:41,921
Bless you!

460
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,876
I like mystery.

461
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,512
There's smoke but no fire.

462
00:28:57,636 --> 00:28:58,410
There's a shadow but no ray of light.

463
00:28:58,504 --> 00:28:59,949
There're words but nothing to say.

464
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,046
Sometimes one needs
to be puzzled to unravel mysteries..

465
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,520
..and I am totally ready for it.

466
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,618

Tea or coffee?

Or you see.. - Black..coffee.

472

Coffee. - Yes.

473

Black.

474
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,129
By the way,
your incoming here is useless.

475
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:20,995
Because your job
is to catch the living beings..

476
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,128
""not the dead.

477
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:24,735
By the way,
what will the second sahib will take?

478

You see all home burden
on my small headmhnn...

You felt like kin
so I opened up my heart.

Otherwise I talk very less.

482

Workload, no time you see.

483

Shall we?

484

Hey, you my assistant.

You order, I fire.

to this house.

Shanti. (Peace)

488
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,568
Brrrr...It's a sin to wash your hands..

489

..in this cold weather of Shimla.

Chatterbox took it.

Chatterbox?

495
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,084
Oh...her.

496

And you let that thief take it.

497
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:20,189
She isn't a thief.

You mean she has a
habit of stealing. - Yes...

bitter gourds in her sleep.

I am so happy, Samrat.

559
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:45,193
I came here to say thanks.

560
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:46,868
But I didn't do anything.

561
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:49,128
Sometimes someone's presence..

562
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,568
..makes a lot of difference. - Thanks.

563
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,569
But do you think this flowen.

564
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:55,535
..is a reasonable reason to smile?

565
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,546
No matter what the reason is..

566
00:33:57,836 --> 00:33:59,179
""but happiness has finally returned.

567
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,745
And on this particular day.

568
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,279
Tomorrow is papa's birthday.

569
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:04,416
And there is small get-together
this evening.

570
00:34:05,077 --> 00:34:08,149
Please do come - Sure.

571
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,685
Every man has the same nature.

572
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:12,591
It's only their habits
that make them different.

573
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,826
Keep your eyes and ears open.

574
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:16,659
There are too many questions""

575
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,200
..and just one night
to find the answers...

576
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:19,861
...That's tonight.

577
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,168
You meanmghost""

578
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:25,834
The ghost hasn't fled?

579
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,742
The ghost that scared everyone""

580
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,471
""gets scared by a red cloth?

581
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,879
Flowers blooming due
to the grace of Belgium Baba?

582
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:35,116
Mahendra Pratap Singh still is sad..

583
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:36,150
..even after the ghost fled...

584
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,413
Hari hiding behind the door...

585
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:39,148
Vijay detesting our presence...

586
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,851
All these events point
towards something untoward.

587
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:44,854
That's the point.

588
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:47,857
Why can't I think of all this?

589
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,100
Anyway, nights are the
mother of all mysteries.

590
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:17,925
""The night's acrid.""

591
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,359
""Sometimes it feels pleasing.""

592
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,993
""The secrets of the hearts.""

593
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,862
""Are never known to anyone.""

594
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:30,403
""There's a spark under
the layers of ice.""

595
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:33,033
""There's fog all around.""

596
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:36,375
""There's a gesture on the lips.""

597
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:39,078
""But without voice.""

598
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:42,918
""Pick up a glass of tequila.""

599
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:45,247
""Forget all your sorrows.""

600
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,250
""Enchanting are the blue eyes.""

601
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,060
"" Beware... Stay aware...""

602
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:54,154
""Pick up a glass of tequila.""

603
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:57,499
""Forget all your sorrows.""

604
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:00,160
""Enchanting are the blue eyes.""

605
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:03,199
"" Beware... Stay aware...""

606
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:16,043
VijaY-

607
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,050
Are you okay? - Of course, why?

608
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:21,719
Are you sure? - Yes, I am fine.

609
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:28,195
Come, I'll introduce
you to a special guest.

610
00:36:28,954 --> 00:36:29,898
Come.

611
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:32,866
Let me introduce you.

612
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:35,004
This is our lawyer Dinesh Das.

613
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,071
You can also call him DD.

614
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,868
I am used to CD.

615
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:41,669
I'll get used to DD as well.

616
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:46,207
Famous detective... Mr.
Samrat Tilakdhari.

617
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:49,916
DD sir, being famous is a..

618
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:52,579
""disgusting by product of my job.

619
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:55,013
Sanjay.

620
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:56,153
Sorry, excuse me.

621
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:57,559
Sanjay, come with me.

622
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,092
Divya's unwell again.

623
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:00,157
I'll just be back. - Excuse me.

624
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:01,155
Please carry on.

625
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:05,193
Poor Sanjay.

626
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:08,199
I guess Divya's
getting the fits again.

627
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,888
So... Mahendra
Pratap has changed his will.

628
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:31,186
Yes, he did in a big haste.

629
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,827
He got all the papers
ready within 2 days.

630
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,496
And signed it too.

631
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:39,933
It seemed like he was
going to forsake everything""

632
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,399
..and retire to the Himalayas.

633
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:45,734
But how did you know?

634
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:49,670
My job is to arrive at conclusions""

635
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,270
""from observations, DD sir.

I think papa must be ready.

I should go fetch him.

663
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:23,802
I'll go get him.

Papa!

667
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:48,358
Send the body for post
mortem after taking photos.

668

Yes, sir.

669
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,929
Don't miss any evidence. - Yes, sir.

670
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,762
And no one enters this area..

671
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,396
...until the investigation is over.

672
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,447
I said no one enters this area.

673

Cooperate with us, please.

674
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,052
And everyone go wait in the hall.

675

We'll call you one by one.

676

You come with us.

..their frequent quarrels
would lead to this.

680
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:18,949
The reason for these quarrels,
Puran kaka?

681
00:41:19,244 --> 00:41:21,019
Vijay's behavior.

682
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:25,456
Vijay had no interest in business.

683
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:28,462
He would squander money on bad habits.

684
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:31,499
In a fit of rage the master..

685
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:33,793
..put a stop to his squandering""

686
00:41:33,892 --> 00:41:36,463

687

Relax.

688
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:45,477
Now tell me everything
that happened tonight in detail.

689
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:48,779
I was in the kitchen.

690
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,416
Just then...I received
a call from the master.

691
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:57,192
Hello. - Bring a jug
of water to my room, Puran.

692
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:58,422
Yes, sir.

693
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:02,420
Vijay, my money isn't
for you to squander.

694
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:05,395
I won't give you a penny.

695
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:07,262
I will take it, papa..

âEven if I have
to do anything for it.

But Vijay's
quarrels with the master..

700

..had become a common thing.

701
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,204
So I hung up the phone""

702
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,407
..and went into master's
room with the water.

703
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:23,817
Master!!!

704
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:30,449
Vijay sir has killed his fatherl!

705
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,487
Did you see Vijay..

706

""pressing on or
taking off the pillow?

But what does it all mean?

709
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:42,533
I don't deduce conclusions so soon,
Puran kaka.

710
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:45,471
All I know is that
one should believeâ.

711
00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:47,401
""someone who's doubted the most.

712
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:51,870
He would often be brash with papa..

713

..but that doesn't mean that Vijay..

714
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,445
No. No way.

715
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,116
Brother couldn't have killed papa.

716
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:01,451
Find the real killer at any cost.

717
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:06,454
Sir. - Sit.

718
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,132
Where are the CCTV cameras
installed in the house?

719
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,494
Ground floor, first floon.

720
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:14,498
..and everywhere outside.

721
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:15,902
And second floor?

722
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:18,504
Everyone's bedrooms are
on the second floor, 50..

723
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,041
Oh, I see.

724
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:21,404
Sir, this is the party's footage.

725
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,357
Who is he?

726
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:39,590
The one who's secretly
getting into the party?

727
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:41,026
That's Anuj.

728
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,257
Dimpy's...friend.

729
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:46,428
In fact papa and everyone else..

730
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:48,026
..were strictly
against Dimpy's choice.

731
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:49,533
Because he's such a loser.

732
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,240
In fact,
two days ago papa warned him..

733
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,843
""not to come anywhere close to Dimpy.

734
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:58,202
But he was here.

735
00:43:58,870 --> 00:43:59,974
I didn't know it.

736
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:02,946
Love no doubt gives you courage.

737
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:05,752
Do you suspect anyone? - No.

738
00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:07,455
I cannot doubt anyone.

739
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:10,754
Interesting. . .kids.

00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:14,325
Do you come here every day?
- Yes, Samrat.

741
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:16,221
Since childhood,
I've been a believerâ.

742
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:19,995
..in Vivekanand's saying ""A
healthy mind lives in a healthy body"".

743
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:22,499
And I teach them martial
arts to keep them healthy.

744
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:25,268
So that they don't lose
hope in life without fighting.

745
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:26,840
Good.

746
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:28,469
You live up to your
name: Deepak (lamp).

747
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,871
A lamp burns to enlighten others.

748
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,440
By the way,
what's your view about Vijay?

749
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:38,178
I've no position to have
a view about my masters.

750
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:39,846
By the way, think about it yourself""

751
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:42,424
..if Sanjay sir doubted his brothen.

752
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,023
""would he spend all
night arranging for Vijay's bail?

753
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:47,591
Sir, we'll know the real matter..

754
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:48,687
âOnly after the reports come in.

755
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:50,732
This is a high-profile
and sensitive case.

756
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:52,998
Do it under the wrap. - Yes, sir.

757
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,364
Sir, we arrested Vijay yesterday.

758
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:56,635
The evidence.. - Good morning, sir.

759
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,199
Samrat!

760
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:01,639
How are you doing?

761
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:02,573
Very fine Sir.

762
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:03,709
Khalid. - Yes, sir.

763
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:04,745
This is Samrat.

764
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:07,049
My best student.

765
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,246
Batch...2008, right? - Bang on, sir.

766
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:14,316
He had to leave IPS
because of weak eyesight.

767
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:16,147
But he has a strong vision.

768
00:45:16,614 --> 00:45:18,184
That's why he's still
doing the same job.

769
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:19,961
The search of truth.

770
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:21,925
Right? - Right, sir.

771
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:23,028
What brings you here?

772
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:25,893
The Mahendra Pratap
Singh murder case, sir.

773
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:29,733
Khalid was telling
me about the same case.

774
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:31,069
Oh really?

775
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:33,841
Khalid, do help Samrat.

776
00:45:34,365 --> 00:45:36,902
And if required,
take his help as well.

777
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,277
All the best.

778
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,570
Nice seeing you, sir.

779
00:45:41,873 --> 00:45:43,409
Insp. Khalid, with your permission""

780
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:44,578
..can I see Vijay?

781
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:47,584
You do have Sir's permission.

782
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:49,381
And let me know if
you find out anything else.

783
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:51,958
Because now I have to help you..

784
00:45:52,016 --> 00:45:52,653
..and take your help too.

785
00:45:53,151 --> 00:45:55,461
If you want my help
then tell me the truth.

786
00:45:57,155 --> 00:45:59,692
I was in the party
when papa called me.

787
00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:10,036
Yes, papa.
- Come to my room right now.

788
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:14,581
No, I can't come now.
- How dare you say no to me?

789
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:17,213
Come now or you won't get a penny.

790
00:46:33,424 --> 00:46:35,062
Yes, papa, why did you call me?

791
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:39,735
Papa!

792
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:48,676
Master!!

793
00:46:52,677 --> 00:46:54,679
Vijay sir has killed his fatherl!

794
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:04,457
Mr. Vijay,
truth isn't a coin that has two sides.

795
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:07,730
Either you're lying or Puran Kaka is.

796
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:10,662
Sir. - Come, Samrat.

797
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,371
I've something to show you.

798
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:15,804
There are strange mails..

799
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,711
..in Mahendra Pratap's email account.

800
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:20,074
The first mail came one month ago.

801
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:23,081
And then similar mails
came every 4-5 days.

802
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:25,080
The IP address for
each mail is different""

803
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:27,050
..so it's difficult
to trace the sender.

804
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:29,081
And even the code language..

805
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,120
""can't be decoded.

806
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,126
Sir, I had a word
with the language expert.

807
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:34,562
He thinks this is some
old African language.

808
00:47:34,986 --> 00:47:35,828
He's trying.

809
00:47:35,887 --> 00:47:37,161
We'll soon reach a conclusion.

810
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:40,164
Sir, can these emails
be forwarded to me?

811
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:41,526
Of course.

812
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:43,102
Khalid. - Sir.

""Mahendra Pratap was
sitting on this chair..

818

..and talking to Puran kaka.

819
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:47,458
Standing in front was a furious Vijay.

820
00:49:47,752 --> 00:49:49,459
Vijay lost his coolmand he started""

When he died...the phone
must have slipped from his hand.

My memory can't deceive me.

827
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:06,746
The phone wasn't here that night.

828
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:07,976
It wasn't anywhere.

829
00:50:09,807 --> 00:50:10,911
So where was the phone that night?

830
00:51:20,778 --> 00:51:21,586
You can't bind time""

831
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:23,022
..at least wear your watch.

832
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:24,518
Puran kaka returned it.

833
00:51:24,682 --> 00:51:25,626
It's right there.

834
00:51:27,118 --> 00:51:29,189
Oh, that's the point.

835
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,192
Thank God you told me.

836
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:32,894
Otherwise I would've thought..

837
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:33,867
""this is the ghosï¬s doing.

838
00:51:34,158 --> 00:51:36,138
CD, I went out to look for the ghost""

839
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:37,531
""but I returned
with evidence instead.

840
00:51:38,796 --> 00:51:40,901

..Hardy Boy's books on
Mahendra Pratap's book shelf.

842

SQ?

843
00:51:45,503 --> 00:51:48,484
How's it connected with this
jumbled up ABCD of some kid?

844
00:51:48,906 --> 00:51:50,146
That's the point.

845
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:53,814
Life is an unsolved puzzle,
and I love it.

846
00:51:54,912 --> 00:51:58,917

Guess.

00:52:03,387 --> 00:52:06,834
I am CD not STD. - It's simple CD.

850
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:09,000
Replace every letter with its latter..

851
00:52:09,093 --> 00:52:12,097
..in the same setup
and the message is clear.

852
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,434
Like...

853
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,775
Replace H with I.

854
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:20,443
S with T.

855
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,784
And R with S.

856
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:24,811
That's ITS.

857
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:26,144
And likewise.

858
00:52:26,677 --> 00:52:31,217
And the message is... 'It's
Time To Pay For Your Old Sin'.

859
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:33,684
Oh!

860
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,423
That means an old secret is out.

861
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,428
I'll try the second one.

862
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:48,437
Death...Is...The...

863
00:52:50,935 --> 00:52:51,970
Rice.

864
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:53,571
Not Rice, CD, Price.

865
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:56,408
Oh yes, Price.

866
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:58,753
Death...Is...The...Price.

867
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,279
Yes.

868
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:03,751
And this...mail just
one day before the party.

869
00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:06,086
Life's ultimate goal is death.

870

Happy Birthday.

871
00:53:08,052 --> 00:53:08,757
Get it?

872
00:53:09,253 --> 00:53:11,130
It wasn't the gardener's spirit""

873
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:12,133
...it was these dreadful mails..

874
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,760
..that were scaring
Late Mahendra Pratap Singh.

875
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:17,500
Thank you
Samrat, for sharing this information.

876
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:19,866
You really are smart.

877
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:21,469
Arjun sir was right.

878
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:23,904
I misjudged you.

879
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:26,914
It's absolutely fine.

880
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:29,477
Khalid. What does the
post-mortem report say?

881
00:53:30,174 --> 00:53:31,278
Nothing unusual.

882
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:32,453
As expected.

883
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:34,255
The reason of death is asphyxiation.

884
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:36,451
Vijay Singh has been granted bail.

885
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:39,954
He's got bail,
let's see what he gets in the will.

886
00:53:41,018 --> 00:53:45,160
According to Late Mahendra
Pratap Singh's willâ.

887
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:48,232
..50% share of his property""

888
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:52,169
âwill go to a
charitable organizationâ

889
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:55,075
..which runs an orphanage.

890
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,773
And the remaining 50%
will be equally divided..

891
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:04,917
""between his children : Sanjay,
Vijay, Divya and Dimpy.

892
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:06,413
I don't accept this will.

893
00:54:07,645 --> 00:54:08,749
Since when did he start doing charity?

894
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,585
He never gave a penny to a beggar.

895
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:13,951
Disgusting!

896
00:54:14,285 --> 00:54:16,128
Control yourself, Vijay.

897
00:54:16,387 --> 00:54:19,630
The law will accept this will only.

898
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,563
By the way,
when did papa sign this will?

899
00:54:23,894 --> 00:54:28,104
On the 11th of this month at 11:15 pm.

900
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:30,637
But why did he change the will?

901
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,102
What was the reason?

902
00:54:32,136 --> 00:54:33,114
Will anyone tell me?

903
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:36,679
The reason behind the
will and kill is the same.

904
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:37,774
I am sure.

905
00:54:38,242 --> 00:54:40,244
This case is taking
a new turn each day, CD.

906
00:54:41,245 --> 00:54:42,952
Some NGO benefitted from the will.

907
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,215
But no connection.

908
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:46,685
Or maybe indirect.

909
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:48,861
The person sending the threat mails..

910
00:54:49,086 --> 00:54:49,860
..is an old friend or foe.

911
00:54:50,154 --> 00:54:52,464
But why would he
leave behind evidence?

912
00:54:52,823 --> 00:54:53,460
The garden was withering""

913
00:54:53,724 --> 00:54:55,169
""but it turned lush green again
when Belgium Baba arrived.

914
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:56,864
The gardener's ghost mystery...

915
00:54:57,361 --> 00:54:59,238
Everything's clear
but everything's fake.

916
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,375
There are many paths in this maze""

917
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:03,710
..but only one heads
towards the destination.

918
00:55:04,101 --> 00:55:05,705
That's the point.

919
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:08,640
But aren't all these evidences
pointing towards something?

920
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,280
CD a smart criminal isn't someone
who doesn't leave behind evidence.

921
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:14,384
It's someone who does
leave behind an evidence..

922
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:16,382
""but only to mislead us.

923
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,319
What?

924
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:20,322
Papa was getting threat mails?

925
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,894
I don't know anything about it.

926
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:27,395
Who?

927
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:29,398
Who was sending papa
these threat mails?

928
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:31,395
We're still mum on whom.

929
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,104
Did your papa have any enemies?

930
00:55:34,765 --> 00:55:35,402
There's no dearth of people""

931
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:37,268
""who are jealous
of someone's success.

932
00:55:38,035 --> 00:55:41,414
Butmsomeone who would take his life?

933
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:43,413
I don't think so.

934
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:46,147
Mahendra Pratap was a very nice man.

935
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,156
He reminded me of my father.

936
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:50,053
He would share many things with me..

937
00:55:50,114 --> 00:55:52,321
""other than business. - Really?

938
00:55:53,117 --> 00:55:55,063
Did he ever mention the threats mails?

939
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:56,355
<i>Never.</i>

940
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:58,155
He never said anything.

941
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:00,367
And...I can never imagine..

942
00:56:00,658 --> 00:56:02,899
..that someone can threaten him.

943
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:04,799
But he did received threats.

944
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:07,066
Truth is like a ray of light.

945
00:56:07,164 --> 00:56:08,871
It won't go away
if you close your eyes.

946
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,278
According to you,
who was his most trusted soldier..

947
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,370
""who's known him for years.

948
00:56:13,904 --> 00:56:16,077
This happened 26 years ago.

949
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:18,610
It was our first
madam's 2nd death anniversary.

950
00:56:18,909 --> 00:56:19,944
First madam?

951
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:22,450
Yes, my step mother...

952
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:24,119
Papa's first wife.

953
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:26,818
Brother Sanjay and sister
Divya are her children.

954
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:28,089
Oh, I see.

955
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:29,820
I am listening, Puran kaka.

956
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:31,992
There was a man called Nagendra.

957
00:56:32,823 --> 00:56:35,167
He would often get in master's ways.

958
00:56:37,027 --> 00:56:39,200
His car was rammed by a truck.

959
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,205
The entire family died instantly.

960
00:56:42,967 --> 00:56:44,844
There was one body missing.

961
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,776
Nagendra's <i>7</i> year old son.

962
00:56:49,006 --> 00:56:50,713
People say he's still alive.

963
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:55,282
But his whereabouts is a big mystery.

964
00:56:55,546 --> 00:56:57,719
There are whispers that""

965
00:56:58,549 --> 00:57:00,654
..our master had orchestrated
that accident.

966
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:02,730
Oh...

967
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,591
Maybe it's a story
of sweet strange revenge.

968
00:57:06,123 --> 00:57:07,295
Now the clouds are clear.

969
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:09,394
I can see the sky.

970
00:57:09,693 --> 00:57:11,400
It was late Mahendra
Pratap Singh's guilt""

971
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:13,402
""not his fear that
made him change his will...

972
00:57:13,697 --> 00:57:15,802
...and donate 50% to the orphanage.

973
00:57:16,867 --> 00:57:18,972
What's the point of all this now?

974
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,077
The master's already dead.

975
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:28,953
Yes, Khalid.

976
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:30,284
We're unable to trace Anuj.

977
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:31,252
He's missing.

978
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:32,818
I'll find him.

979
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:34,256
Just text me his address.

980
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:45,767
First this cat keeps
crying all night..

981
00:57:45,863 --> 00:57:46,933
..and doesn't let me sleep, and now..

982
00:57:47,231 --> 00:57:48,039
Hello.

983
00:57:48,065 --> 00:57:49,169
Sir, I am Samrat.

984
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,207
I am investigating
Mahendra Pratap's murder.

985
00:57:52,436 --> 00:57:53,813
Where's your tenant Anuj?

986
00:57:54,438 --> 00:57:55,212
Sir, he lives up here.

987
00:57:55,439 --> 00:57:57,112
But I've no clue where
he has been since few days.

988
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:59,111
What do I say?

989
00:57:59,443 --> 00:58:02,549
Anuj has no relatives or kin.

990
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:04,223
He was raised in an orphanage.

991
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:05,952
What to do?

992
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:08,126
I've to check Anuj's room.

993
00:58:08,452 --> 00:58:09,226
I can't give you his room keys""

994
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:11,624
""without his permission.

995
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:15,165
That's fine.
- Goodbye.

996
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:18,798
What were you saying...the
cat cries a lot at night?

997
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:20,641
Car?

998
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:23,007
Don't ask,
sir, sometimes she cries a lot.

999
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:24,910
But...why, sir?

1000
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:34,478
That's the point, STD.

1001
00:58:34,778 --> 00:58:36,121
Now I get everything.

1002
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,489
Anuj is the kid that
survived in the accident.

1003
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:40,489
And he avenged his family's death.

1004
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:41,829
Simple.

1005
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:43,157
Possible.

1006
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:45,997
CD, go home.

1007
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,494
I just remembered
something I've to do.

1008
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:49,428
What are you going to do without me?

1009
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,169
It's a small, simple task.

1010
00:58:51,428 --> 00:58:52,270
Not of your caliber.

1011
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:53,406
Then it's okay.

1012
00:58:53,764 --> 00:58:54,469
Go ahead.

1013
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,365
Anuj's phone is unreachable.

1014
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:28,531
His phone's switched off
since the night of the murder.

1015
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:32,437
I can't ask you that how did you know.

1016
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:36,467
But I would like to tell you that""

1017
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,473
..there was nothing left between us.

1018
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:40,815
But I am a bit concerned about him.

1019
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:42,944
I wish even he was.

1020
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:45,513
Have a look.

1021
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:51,452
What?

1022
01:00:57,054 --> 01:00:58,397
He's a bloody""

1023
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:01,497
I didn't know all this.

1024
01:01:02,259 --> 01:01:04,239
But where did you find all this?

1025
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:07,406
Heart is fragile, handle it with care.

1026
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:08,834
Anuj's missing.

1027
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:10,473
I got my
hands on these pictures.

1028
01:01:11,101 --> 01:01:12,876
I deleted the files from his computer.

1029
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:14,409
You can burn these.

1030
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:16,477
Parents often sound wrong""

1031
01:01:16,807 --> 01:01:18,377
""but mostly they are right.

1032
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:24,091
What did Anuj say to you in the party?

1033
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:25,482
Party?

1034
01:01:25,816 --> 01:01:27,489
Anuj didn't meet me that night.

1035
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:30,256
But yes, he called me and said..

1036
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:33,665
'Dimpy, I want to tell
you a secret about your family.'

1037
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:38,031
Any guesses what
he wanted to say. - No.

1038
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:40,608
Did you ever try
to find out the past""

1039
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:43,070
..of the person you were
planning your future with?

1040
01:01:44,968 --> 01:01:46,538
The heart doesn't
ask questions, Samrat.

1041
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:48,547
It just trusts.

1042
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,820
He was raised in
Little Dreams Orphanage.

1043
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:55,116
His character. . .is untainted.

1044
01:01:55,479 --> 01:01:57,789
Was. That's the point, STD.

1045
01:01:58,181 --> 01:01:58,989
Excuse me.

1046
01:01:59,249 --> 01:02:02,856
STD, like I said this just
like a Bollywood revenge drama.

1047
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,757
A boy returns to avenge
his parents' death..

1048
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:07,027
""who died in an accident.

1049
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:11,164
Then he convinces a girl
from the same family of his loveâ.

1050
01:02:11,395 --> 01:02:12,465
..and gains entrance into the house.

1051
01:02:12,663 --> 01:02:14,165
Sends threat mails.

1052
01:02:14,531 --> 01:02:16,704
Gets the will transferred
in the name of the orphanage.

1053
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:19,470
And just like the threat mails..

1054
01:02:19,803 --> 01:02:21,146
""he turns Happy Birth Day..

1055
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:24,443
..into a Saddy Death Day.

1056
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:28,813
No film can ever equal
the twists of life, CD.

1057
01:02:29,713 --> 01:02:30,851
Even if I agree to what you sayâ.

1058
01:02:31,281 --> 01:02:33,158
Why did Anuj need
to send threat mails..

1059
01:02:33,383 --> 01:02:36,796
..and make the garden wither
pretending to be the gardener's ghost.

1060
01:02:37,354 --> 01:02:38,492
One more thing.

1061
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,462
If Anuj had left the city, then..

1062
01:02:40,857 --> 01:02:43,098
..he wouldn't have left his
personal belongings in his room.

1063
01:02:43,627 --> 01:02:44,367
That's the point.

1064
01:02:44,628 --> 01:02:46,301
That means your small job..

1065
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:49,304
..was to convince Maganlal and get
the key to Anuj's room. Right?

1066
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,670
I don't need a key to open locks, CD.

1067
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:52,869
You know that.

1068
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:55,607
I saw the entire CCTV
footage of the party.

1069
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:58,110
We can see Anuj secretly
entering the party.

1070
01:02:59,042 --> 01:03:00,282
But not leaving.

1071
01:03:01,578 --> 01:03:02,283
Where could he be?

1072
01:03:05,048 --> 01:03:07,688
We saw him sneaking into
the house but not leaving.

1073
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:08,724
Where is he then?

1074
01:03:10,654 --> 01:03:11,359
Come on Samrat.

1075
01:03:14,057 --> 01:03:15,832
Anuj didn't leave,
means he was here only.

1076
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:17,269
So you mean to say..

1077
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,169
Information is not knowledge, CD.

1078
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:20,367
We often find the first thing..

1079
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:21,431
""but we need to earn the second.

1080
01:03:21,865 --> 01:03:23,037
Why didn't Anuj come out of the house?

1081
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:24,334
At 11:30 he was seen in this camera.

1082
01:03:24,401 --> 01:03:26,403
At 11:40 he called Dimpy.

1083
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,470
But if he had entered the house..

1084
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:28,606
..he would've been
seen in this camera.

1085
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:29,508
But he wasn't.

1086
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,014
If he went out of the house..

1087
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:32,415
..he would've gone in this direction.

1088
01:03:33,076 --> 01:03:34,146
And he would be seen in this camera.

1089
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:35,581
But he wasn't seen here either.

1090
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:38,126
If he had gone in this direction""

1091
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:39,353
..then this camera
would've captured him.

1092
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:42,758
100%...he master's killer catching.

1093
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:44,021
What a pair.

1094
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:46,392
Like James Bonding.

1095
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:50,371
He wasn't in this camera,
or this camera or this one.

1096
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:52,705
So where did Anuj..

1097
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:55,608
Anuj!

1098
01:03:58,301 --> 01:03:59,075
Samrat!

1099
01:03:59,169 --> 01:03:59,977
Samrat!

1100
01:04:00,237 --> 01:04:01,545
Tell me what's up!

1101
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:05,546
Samrat!

1102
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:07,618
Samrat!

1103
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:26,940
CD!

1104
01:04:44,414 --> 01:04:46,087
Looking at the condition of the body..

1105
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:48,596
..I guess he died 3-4 days back.

1106
01:04:54,658 --> 01:04:56,035
That's the point, STD.

1107
01:04:56,993 --> 01:05:00,031
There's a dead body
here and you're smiling.

1108
01:05:01,698 --> 01:05:03,837
CD, do you know the
address to success?

1109
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:05,571
Tell me quickly.

1110
01:05:06,703 --> 01:05:10,048
On the path of difficulty,
through the lane of questions""

1111
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:12,653
..in the alley of challenges.

1112
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:17,986
Come and get ready for
the interesting mystery-ride!

1113
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,543
'Revati's is in a
hurry to go somewhere.'

1114
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:47,078
'Oh, from a memorial
service to a party.'

1115
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:48,748
'That's called insentience.'

1116
01:05:49,012 --> 01:05:50,753
'N0 feelings or emotions.'
'Absolutely detached.'

1117
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,098
'Two phones,
two messages, two expressions.'

1118
01:06:01,591 --> 01:06:03,832
'One from a girlfriend,
and the other for betting.'

1119
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:05,328
'Somewhere he's losing his heart.'

1120
01:06:05,562 --> 01:06:07,166
'And somewhere his mind's losing.'

1121
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:10,872
'Narayani couldn't
keep a watch on her watch.'

1122
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:12,373
'She wore it upside down.'

1123
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,213
'S0 shocked over a neighbor's death!'

1124
01:06:14,938 --> 01:06:16,747
'Either she has a deep
relationship or story.'

1125
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:19,579
Our calculations are all messed up.

1126
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:21,912
The one we suspected is dead.

1127
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:25,021
Who is doing all this?

1128
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:26,722
That's the point.

1129
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:29,687
We'll know soon.

1130
01:06:32,589 --> 01:06:35,627
My dear my friends,
I know this isn't the right time.

1131
01:06:35,692 --> 01:06:37,831
But I have good news for you, that""

1132
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:41,033
..I am just one step
away from the murderer.

1133
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,538
Anuj knew the murderer,
that's why he was killed.

1134
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:48,843
The person who has donned
the mask of decency..

1135
01:06:48,905 --> 01:06:50,009
âWill be unmasked soon.

1136
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:58,758
You're no longer what
you used to be, STD.

1137
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:00,253
You didn't tell me.

1138
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:02,460
I would, if I knew.

1139
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,430
Arrow in darkness, CD.

1140
01:07:04,788 --> 01:07:05,823
I played a blind.

1141
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:07,465
We'll share the loot
if we hit jackpot.

1142
01:07:07,824 --> 01:07:08,461
Oh, I see.

1143
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,331
So there's no bride and
you've announced marriage!

1144
01:07:12,062 --> 01:07:13,803
How will you find the truth so soon?

1145
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:15,809
The truth will come to us, CD.

1146
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:17,968
How will it come to us?

1147
01:07:18,435 --> 01:07:20,108
You and your Samrat-ism.

1148
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:26,414
My prayers work like a charm, sir.

1149
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,518
Please spare me some change.

1150
01:07:30,313 --> 01:07:31,883
May God bless you.

1151
01:07:35,986 --> 01:07:37,659
The beggars here are really generous.

1152
01:07:38,121 --> 01:07:40,101
He gave us something in return.

1153
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:44,494
S...S...Samrat...

1154
01:07:44,994 --> 01:07:46,769
It's a bomb!

1155
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:59,552
Bomb""

1156
01:08:03,046 --> 01:08:04,286
Throw it..!

1157
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:12,590
This is not meant to kill.
It's carrying a message.

1158
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,798
Next time the bomb will be real.

1159
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:23,808
If you value your
life then head back home.

1160
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:25,971
The watch is from a pen-stand
from an office table.

1161
01:08:26,503 --> 01:08:27,675
That means the one who sent the bomb""

1162
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:28,976
..isn't a professional bomb-maker.

1163
01:08:29,372 --> 01:08:31,852
The tightness of
this tape on the pens..

1164
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:34,550
..suggest that the person is strong.

1165
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:35,889
And the writing suggests""

1166
01:08:36,179 --> 01:08:38,318
..that his Hindi isn't
as good as yours, CD.

1167
01:08:39,983 --> 01:08:41,394
We've hit jackpot, CD.

1168
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:43,626
Get ready to share the loot.

1169
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,130
What?

1170
01:08:45,188 --> 01:08:47,429
Are you talking about
sharing the real bomb?

1171
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:52,036
If you had shot this
arrow in the Olympicsâ.

1172
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:53,865
..you would've definitely
won the Gold.

1173
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:55,903
Thanks, Khalid.

1174
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:58,176
Keep the cheese and
the mouse trap ready.

1175
01:08:58,768 --> 01:09:00,645
He's close. - Close?

1176
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,378
Then take this threat
more seriously, STD.

1177
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:04,713
Don't worry, CD.

1178
01:09:05,108 --> 01:09:06,712
This threat is going to lead us..

1179
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,718
..to the other end of the thread.

1180
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:12,417
Khalid, any help from
Anuj's post-mortem report?

1181
01:09:13,016 --> 01:09:14,552
There's been a shocking revelation.

1182
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,323
Mahendra Pratap and Anuj's..

1183
01:09:16,553 --> 01:09:19,090
""time of
death is almost same.

1184
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:23,629
Oh...maybe the gardener's
ghost killed them both.

1185
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:27,073
But I feel Anuj killed
Mahendra Pratap first""

1186
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:28,666
..and then someone killed Anuj.

1187
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,478
Possible.

1188
01:09:31,735 --> 01:09:32,839
And it's also possible that..

1189
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,876
""someone killed Mahendra
Pratap upstairs""

1190
01:09:35,204 --> 01:09:36,774
..and somebody else killed Anuj.

1191
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:40,712
Possible.

1192
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,380
We missed one point.

1193
01:09:42,579 --> 01:09:44,889
Maybe that person who was sending
the threats killed both.

1194
01:09:44,981 --> 01:09:46,051
Not possible.

1195
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:48,088
Why?

1196
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:50,796
Two different places
at the same time..

1197
01:09:50,887 --> 01:09:54,562
""two different victims, two killers.

1198
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:56,697
Two necks, two attacks.

1199
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:58,095
Different methods.

1200
01:09:58,461 --> 01:10:00,600
Anuj's killer is heartless.

1201
01:10:01,164 --> 01:10:04,043
Mahendra Pratap Singh's
killer isn't that brutal.

1202
01:10:04,501 --> 01:10:05,912
The person sending the threats..

1203
01:10:06,002 --> 01:10:07,072
..wasn't spreading
rumors about the ghost..

1204
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:10,579
..because he knew that
Mahendra Pratap Singh..

1205
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:12,050
âWill be scared of threats,
not ghosts.

1206
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:14,882
One goal many strikers.

1207
01:10:15,278 --> 01:10:17,019
More than one person are
working on different things..

1208
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,725
""for different motives.

1209
01:10:18,815 --> 01:10:20,453
And someone's taking advantage of it.

1210
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:23,758
Now we will have to find out""

1211
01:10:24,354 --> 01:10:25,264
""who is doing exactly what.

1212
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:42,708
Hi.

1213
01:10:44,107 --> 01:10:46,087
Hi. - I am sorry, Dimpy.

1214
01:10:47,277 --> 01:10:49,154
First your papa, then Anuj.

1215
01:10:50,313 --> 01:10:51,383
I can understand what
you're going through.

1216
01:10:51,481 --> 01:10:53,552
But I am a little short of sentiments.

1217
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,722
I just do not know how to express.

1218
01:10:57,086 --> 01:11:00,590
It's okay, Samrat.
Thanks for your concern.

1219
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:08,507
But honestly, I don't know
why am I not sad about Anuj..

1220
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:10,269
""like I should be""

1221
01:11:12,702 --> 01:11:15,842
But yes, I miss papa.

1222
01:11:19,175 --> 01:11:20,347
Your papa must have been proud..

1223
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:21,786
""to have a daughter like you.

1224
01:11:24,714 --> 01:11:25,715
Thanks.

1225
01:11:26,049 --> 01:11:27,756
I am sorry for changing
the subject matter.

1226
01:11:28,551 --> 01:11:29,757
But I don't see the driver Hari
around these days.

1227
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:31,755
Earlier he would always keep giving..

1228
01:11:32,088 --> 01:11:33,795
âLive performances
of his mimicry. - Yes.

1229
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:36,536
I noted that too.

1230
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:39,501
He's been upset since
papa passed away.

1231
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,267
And he was saying that""

1232
01:11:41,364 --> 01:11:43,776
...he'll leave his job as soon
as the police investigation is over.

1233
01:11:45,101 --> 01:11:46,444
What? - Yes.

1234
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:47,708
I want to meet him now.

1235
01:11:48,104 --> 01:11:49,139
Right now.

1236
01:11:52,542 --> 01:11:53,816
I'll call him.

1237
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,523
Hello.
- Hari, where are you?

1238
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:03,553
Sorry, madam. Since I had no work,
I came to see a friend.

1239
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:05,428
I'll be back in an hour or two.

1240
01:12:05,555 --> 01:12:06,431
Okay.

1241
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:07,763
Come back soon. - Okay, madam.

1242
01:12:09,459 --> 01:12:12,269
Tail means the person sending
the threats will attack again.

1243
01:12:12,529 --> 01:12:14,475
Heads means the threats are a fake.

1244
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:15,702
That's the point.

1245
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:20,337
I wish I had the same
coin Jai had in 'Sho
ay'.

1246
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:23,448
Anyways, God bless me.

1247
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:29,612
Stop. Stop.

1248
01:12:32,148 --> 01:12:33,218
Tail.

1249
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:34,653
That means attack.

1250
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:54,913
Everything looks blurred.

1251
01:12:55,271 --> 01:12:57,182
There are clouds all around.

1252
01:12:57,774 --> 01:12:58,912
That means I am dead!

1253
01:12:59,909 --> 01:13:01,388
That means I am dead!

1254
01:13:01,845 --> 01:13:04,382
You're alive, CD. Get up.

1255
01:13:06,015 --> 01:13:07,494
I am so sorry, Mr. Chakradhar.

1256
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,923
I apologize on behalf of Divya.

1257
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:14,559
You see...as a child,
Divya saw her mother commit suicide.

1258
01:13:15,158 --> 01:13:17,502
Since then she's a
bit mentally disturbed.

1259
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:19,138
She gets violent whenever
she gets the fits.

1260
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:21,230
Otherwise...she's quite calm.

1261
01:13:21,464 --> 01:13:23,034
Chakradhar ji is absolutely fine.

1262
01:13:23,466 --> 01:13:24,843
Please take care of Divya.

1263
01:13:25,468 --> 01:13:28,472
If you need anything,
please don't hesitate to ask.

1264
01:13:29,105 --> 01:13:30,140
For sure.

1265
01:13:31,274 --> 01:13:32,446
Take care.

1266
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:53,234
I am sure...that mental Divya killed
Mahendra Pratap and Anuj.

1267
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:55,139
I swear on my show.

1268
01:13:56,132 --> 01:13:58,840
I can never forget
those blood filled eyes.

1269
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:02,510
CD, nightmares are
meant to be forgotten.

1270
01:14:02,839 --> 01:14:05,319
Get some rest. I'll be right back.

1271
01:14:06,142 --> 01:14:06,847
From where?

1272
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:09,754
I want to see Hari's
mimicry before he flees.

1273
01:14:10,246 --> 01:14:12,192
His desire of becoming
rich in a short time..

1274
01:14:12,248 --> 01:14:13,852
..has got me thinking.

1275
01:14:32,769 --> 01:14:34,874
Hari isn't planning
to stay here too long.

1276
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:38,885
The empty hangers suggest""

1277
01:14:39,175 --> 01:14:40,677
""that he's packed
his bags to leave soon.

1278
01:14:58,461 --> 01:14:59,906
Here's his train ticket for tomorrow.

1279
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:01,899
Hari's leaving for Mumbai tomorrow.

1280
01:15:02,432 --> 01:15:05,242
But why did he suddenly
plan on leaving?

1281
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:08,239
Tension, CD. Tension.

1282
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:12,451
Dust on the remote.

1283
01:15:13,209 --> 01:15:14,552
That means film buff Hari..

1284
01:15:14,577 --> 01:15:17,319
..didn't touch the remote
after Mahendra Pratap's death.

1285
01:15:21,784 --> 01:15:23,491
But Hari did come to his room.

1286
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:26,566
Because there's no dust
on the light board switch.

1287
01:15:30,793 --> 01:15:32,272
Mr. Chakradhar Pandey,

1288
01:15:32,829 --> 01:15:33,807
would you like some cold waten.

1289
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:35,809
""from an earthen pot in this
cold weather of Shimla.

1290
01:15:36,165 --> 01:15:39,476
No. I am not crazy. - Hari isn't too.

1291
01:15:40,303 --> 01:15:41,509
I am sure.

1292
01:15:52,148 --> 01:15:53,252
So much money?

1293
01:15:53,349 --> 01:15:54,760
Where did Hari get it from?

1294
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:35,430
Don't kill me. - CD!

1295
01:16:35,491 --> 01:16:36,492
I am from Mumbai.

1296
01:16:36,559 --> 01:16:37,867
CD! - Please don't kill me.

1297
01:16:38,161 --> 01:16:40,539
CD! - I am dead. I am dead!

1298
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:42,265
You have 2 minutes.

1299
01:16:42,865 --> 01:16:45,277
Not to make instant noodles,
but to come with me.

1300
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:46,836
Get up. - Where?

1301
01:16:47,169 --> 01:16:47,738
To see Hari.

1302
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:54,347
What's your name? - Devika Kumari.

1303
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:03,328
Case of hit and run.

1304
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:05,288
The accident took place yesterday""

1305
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:06,992
..and the villagers
noticed the body today.

1306
01:17:32,248 --> 01:17:34,250
Death is a beautiful
conclusion of lifeâ.

1307
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:36,863
..but my conclusion
is that, this isn't an accident.

1308
01:17:37,253 --> 01:17:38,926
This is a murder. - What?

1309
01:17:39,555 --> 01:17:40,829
Are you sure?

1310
01:17:41,123 --> 01:17:42,500
I love to be sure.

1311
01:17:43,059 --> 01:17:44,538
It's natural that last evening""

1312
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:48,400
..Hari didn't come to this
secluded spot for an evening walk.

1313
01:17:48,798 --> 01:17:51,404
Someone must have called
him here for some work.

1314
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:53,542
And yesterday evening at around <i>7</i> pm..

1315
01:17:53,803 --> 01:17:56,443
..Hari was standing
under this bus stop..

1316
01:17:56,539 --> 01:17:58,246
..waiting for that person.

1317
01:17:58,908 --> 01:18:01,013
When he saw that person's
car approaching..

1318
01:18:01,077 --> 01:18:04,547
..Hari came on the road
and waved at the car to stop.

1319
01:18:08,084 --> 01:18:10,086
But when the car didn't stop Hari ran.

1320
01:18:31,774 --> 01:18:34,084
We're dealing with a
very cunning criminal, CD.

1321
01:18:35,244 --> 01:18:36,245
Damn it.

1322
01:18:37,346 --> 01:18:39,485
He's always one step ahead of me.

1323
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:50,331
Samrat...

1324
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:51,494
Samrat!

1325
01:18:54,096 --> 01:18:55,803
Hi, good morning.

1326
01:18:56,198 --> 01:18:57,905
Where are you coming from,
this early in the morning?

1327
01:18:58,634 --> 01:19:02,343
Hari's been murdered. - What?

1328
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:06,679
Whomwho killed him? - You..

1329
01:19:08,878 --> 01:19:10,016
You started jogging recently?

1330
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:15,527
I have been jogging for years.

1331
01:19:16,219 --> 01:19:20,224
But who do you think
committed the murder?

1332
01:19:20,823 --> 01:19:22,734
The same person who killed
Mahendra Pratap Singh.

1333
01:19:24,627 --> 01:19:28,507
But you said you're going
to expose the murderer soon.

1334
01:19:28,831 --> 01:19:30,174
That's why he killed Hari.

1335
01:19:34,203 --> 01:19:35,181
Okay. . bye-

1336
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:36,614
BYE, bye, see you.

1337
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:40,919
Lucknow City College.

1338
01:19:41,544 --> 01:19:42,887
Which batch, Mrs. Narayani?

1339
01:19:47,850 --> 01:19:49,887
Actually. . .I can't remember.

1340
01:19:51,153 --> 01:19:52,928
I think it was the early 70's.

1341
01:19:54,557 --> 01:19:55,558
Why?

1342
01:19:55,691 --> 01:19:57,932
Mahendra Pratap was in the
same college during the same period.

1343
01:19:58,694 --> 01:20:00,605
Were you two batch mates? - No, no.

1344
01:20:01,197 --> 01:20:04,337
Actually. . .I can't remember.

1345
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,902
Honestly, I really can't remember.

1346
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:08,079
Oh, I am sorry.
I completely forgot.

1347
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:13,213
You told me that you
two met just recently.

1348
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:16,216
BYE. Bye.

1349
01:20:20,016 --> 01:20:21,723
What were you trying to find out, STD?

1350
01:20:22,051 --> 01:20:23,962
CD, give me your mobile phone. - Here.

1351
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:27,091
Why? Does your mobile
have network problem?

1352
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:29,792
CD, you're forgetting
the rules of Samratism.

1353
01:20:30,459 --> 01:20:32,097
Before finding someone""

1354
01:20:32,395 --> 01:20:34,671
..you need to hide yourself.
- Yes.

1355
01:20:34,764 --> 01:20:36,072
Wait and watch.

1356
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:39,511
When the time comes... we'll
reap the rewards..

1357
01:20:39,735 --> 01:20:40,975
..and then I will answer
the stupidest of your questions.

1358
01:20:41,036 --> 01:20:42,515
Let me know when you get a reply.

1359
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:04,998
Someone came into this
room precisely 2 minutes ago.

1360
01:21:05,928 --> 01:21:07,908
And searched this place foolishly.

1361
01:21:08,797 --> 01:21:09,901
Here?

1362
01:21:10,766 --> 01:21:11,540
Who could it be?

1363
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:13,138
We'll find that out.

1364
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:16,206
But right now I am thinking
about the one we just met.

1365
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:19,152
Mrs. Narayani. - Yes.

1366
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:21,183
Why did she lie?

1367
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,049
What is she hiding?

1368
01:21:23,145 --> 01:21:25,455
An old friendship...or enmity.

1369
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:28,494
That means at this age Mr. Kishore""

1370
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:31,532
âwill be single, ready to mingle.

1371
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:34,667
What do you mean? - That's the point.

1372
01:21:34,924 --> 01:21:40,806
Every person you
suspect, lands up dead.

1373
01:21:41,297 --> 01:21:43,243
First Anuj, then Hari..

1374
01:21:43,299 --> 01:21:45,745
..and now, poor Mrs. Narayani.

1375
01:21:49,405 --> 01:21:53,785
This is the same
kid's jumbled up ABCD.

1376
01:21:59,749 --> 01:22:01,092
Yes!!! Yes!!!

1377
01:22:01,183 --> 01:22:02,628
Yes, CD, I've nailed it!

1378
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:04,796
I sent a message in code.

1379
01:22:04,887 --> 01:22:05,957
The game of hide and seek is over.

1380
01:22:06,422 --> 01:22:07,127
When and where do we meet?

1381
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:08,660
And this is the reply.

1382
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:11,131
Tomorrow morning at 6,
Jogger's park, last bench.

1383
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:12,663
And he's the one""

1384
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,331
""who used to send
threats to Mahendra Pratap?

1385
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:15,337
Yes.

1386
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:19,009
And you sent him my number? - Yes.

1387
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:21,005
Are you my friend or foe?

1388
01:22:21,337 --> 01:22:23,476
As soon as I return to Mumbai,
I'll change this number.

1389
01:22:23,572 --> 01:22:27,486
CD...if you change nothing,
nothing will change.

1390
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:31,686
And anywaymhe won't
call you from Tihar Jail.

1391
01:22:32,548 --> 01:22:35,392
For now let's call Khalid
and call him also tomorrow morning..

1392
01:22:37,386 --> 01:22:39,525
""completely prepared.

1393
01:23:03,579 --> 01:23:06,423
Khalid, hope you have a good aim...?

1394

IfI shoot someone's eye,
his ear will not come to know.

1395
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:12,090
Okay, then it's fine.

1396
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:37,589
What do you know?

1397
01:23:38,714 --> 01:23:42,992
You're good at jogging,
but you can't run very far.

1398
01:23:45,421 --> 01:23:50,063
You? - Yes, me.

1399
01:23:51,093 --> 01:23:52,436
Who is it?

1400
01:23:52,828 --> 01:23:55,138
I hope he doesn't attack STD.

1401
01:23:55,497 --> 01:23:56,498
Take a seat.

1402
01:23:59,935 --> 01:24:01,505
World's most lovable crime.

1403
01:24:02,004 --> 01:24:04,280
Steal someone's peace and slumber.

1404
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:06,411
First threats,
then rumors about ghosts.

1405
01:24:06,809 --> 01:24:10,018
With a hope that the
man dies of a cardiac arrest.

1406
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:11,915
But when that didn't happen""

1407
01:24:12,014 --> 01:24:14,426
..you personally transported Mr.
Mahendra Pratap""

1408

""to the Eden Gardens. - What?

""college group photo.

solidified my suspicion.

Why did you kill him?

1413
01:24:28,497 --> 01:24:29,999

Honestly"" - Whether the truth
is beautiful or not..

1415

..it's consequences are.

1416
01:24:35,137 --> 01:24:36,548
Please speak the truth.

1417
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:40,049
I never imagined
that the return gift..

1418
01:24:40,376 --> 01:24:43,448
..of a prank played years
ago would be so dreadful.

1419
01:24:43,545 --> 01:24:44,580
Hello.

1420
01:24:46,348 --> 01:24:47,383
Thanks, mama.

1421
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:50,430
But there's still two minutes to 12.

1422
01:24:50,786 --> 01:24:51,924
Hello.

1423
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:53,088
Hello.

1424
01:25:24,653 --> 01:25:27,065
Happy birthday to you!

1425
01:25:27,556 --> 01:25:30,594
Happy birthday to you!

1426
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:37,042
That was Mahendra's idea.

1427
01:25:37,533 --> 01:25:38,978
But I broke my leg.

1428
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:42,407
Mahendra apologized to
me many times for that prank.

1429
01:25:43,339 --> 01:25:45,376
I wanted to scare Mahendra""

1430
01:25:45,741 --> 01:25:47,618
""just like he scared me.

1431
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:54,559
After college...we
met just two months ago.

01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,426
Luckily, I recognized him..

1433

""but he didn't recognize me.

1434
01:26:00,456 --> 01:26:02,094
And taking advantage of this""

1435
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:04,100
..I started sending him those emails.

1436
01:26:05,861 --> 01:26:09,434
Mahendra used code letters in college.

1437
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:12,167
I thought he'll understand.

1438
01:26:13,035 --> 01:26:14,446
But that didn't happen.

1439
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:17,477
Then those ghostly events started.

1440
01:26:17,806 --> 01:26:20,082
And I was enjoying
the fear on his face.

1441
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:23,080
My small revenge was
about to get completed""

1442

..on his 60th birthday.

1443
01:26:25,381 --> 01:26:26,519
When I was going to gift him..

1444
01:26:26,548 --> 01:26:29,859
..that college group
photo and tell him the truth.

1445
01:26:31,286 --> 01:26:33,926
But...before that...

1446
01:26:34,556 --> 01:26:38,026
You know what...happened then...

1447
01:26:40,796 --> 01:26:42,537
The next night I did go to his room""

1448
01:26:42,831 --> 01:26:44,469
""to delete those mails.

1449
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,579
But my bad luck, the police had
already taken his laptop into custody.

1450
01:26:58,647 --> 01:27:02,117
Samrat, I haven't
shared all this with anyone""

1451
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:04,163
""except for you.

1452
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:06,595
Not even with my husband.

1453
01:27:07,122 --> 01:27:13,073
If you believe me,
then please don't tell anyone.

1454
01:27:14,496 --> 01:27:16,237
Please let it all be a secret.

1455
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:19,338
My job is to unravel secrets.

1456
01:27:20,269 --> 01:27:21,976
But in your case, until and unless""

1457
01:27:22,304 --> 01:27:26,514
""there's a really big reason,
I will keep it under wraps.

1458
01:27:28,143 --> 01:27:29,178
Promise.

1459
01:27:29,478 --> 01:27:30,548
Thank you.

1460
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,525
By the way who came to see you?

1461
01:27:33,882 --> 01:27:36,089
You can say that he has
no connection with this case.

1462
01:27:36,552 --> 01:27:38,054
CD there was a point in your point.

1463
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:40,555
The jumbled ABCD
was actually the prank of a kid.

1464
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:42,501
That's the point.

1465
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:45,003
If you had recognized
my talent earlier..

1466
01:27:45,094 --> 01:27:47,040
..you wouldn't have wasted 4 days.

1467
01:27:47,296 --> 01:27:49,401
I am sorry, CD. I made a mistake.

1468
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:51,509
But now rack your brains..

1469
01:27:51,533 --> 01:27:54,639
..and find out who's
behind the three bigger pranks.

1470
01:27:55,137 --> 01:27:57,674
Let's catch and send
him to hell. - Okay.

1471
01:28:01,043 --> 01:28:01,680
Hello.

1472
01:28:02,411 --> 01:28:03,116
Yes. Yes.

1473
01:28:03,545 --> 01:28:05,115
Saiju, don't worry.

1474
01:28:05,547 --> 01:28:06,924
But, brothen.
- This time I'll get you a big story.

1475
01:28:07,015 --> 01:28:08,790
I've to go. I don't have time.

1476
01:28:08,884 --> 01:28:11,455
No, no, telecast this
episode with an old story.

1477
01:28:11,853 --> 01:28:12,854
And listen...clear everyone's cheque.

1478
01:28:13,188 --> 01:28:14,826
Mistress in distress.

1479
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:16,158
Any problem?

1480
01:28:16,825 --> 01:28:19,328
Actually, I've to attend
an important art exhibition.

1481
01:28:19,428 --> 01:28:20,964
And there's not a single car at home.

1482
01:28:21,263 --> 01:28:22,970
So...I am stuck.

1483
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:24,971
So take my car. - Oh, no, no, no.

1484
01:28:25,267 --> 01:28:27,144
I've called up brother
and asked him to send a car.

1485
01:28:27,502 --> 01:28:29,504
Formalities are good
between strangers.

1486
01:28:29,872 --> 01:28:31,977
But we know each other a bit now.

1487
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,144
Right?

1488
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:36,685
Right. Thanks.

1489
01:28:54,096 --> 01:28:56,599
""This is a game of ABC...""

1490
01:28:57,099 --> 01:28:58,806
""Don't take your foot off A..""

1491
01:28:58,867 --> 01:29:00,540
""..and don't touch B and C.""

1492
01:29:01,236 --> 01:29:06,083
""If the arrow reduces to 50,
you'll be responsible for a 'boom' ..""

1493
01:29:08,877 --> 01:29:09,947
A Puzzle?

1494
01:29:13,148 --> 01:29:14,252
What does it mean?

1495
01:29:14,616 --> 01:29:15,594
What does it mean?

1496
01:29:16,551 --> 01:29:17,256
What's he trying to say?

1497
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:19,627
What does A B C mean?

1498
01:29:20,656 --> 01:29:21,794
Don't take your foot off A?

1499
01:29:22,391 --> 01:29:23,734
What we do with the foot?

1500
01:29:24,493 --> 01:29:25,665
Don't touch B and C.

1501
01:29:26,128 --> 01:29:27,106
B and C means?

1502
01:29:27,395 --> 01:29:28,430
Come on, Samrat.

1503
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:29,931
What does it mean?

1504
01:29:30,098 --> 01:29:31,099
Come on, Samrat.

1505
01:29:31,166 --> 01:29:32,167
Focus.

1506
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:33,676
What does it mean?

1507
01:29:34,903 --> 01:29:35,677
ABC

1508
01:29:36,305 --> 01:29:37,682
Come on, Samrat.

1509
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:41,042
Driving.

1510
01:29:41,677 --> 01:29:42,985
First lesson of driving.

1511
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:46,052
ABC means Accelerator,
Brake and Clutch.

1512
01:29:46,615 --> 01:29:47,923
Don't take your foot
off the accelerator.

1513
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:49,760
Don't touch the brake and clutch.

1514
01:29:50,519 --> 01:29:51,657
Arrow points to the speedometer.

1515
01:29:51,753 --> 01:29:53,596
If the speed reduces to 50...boom!

1516
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:55,866
The bomb will explode.

1517
01:29:58,927 --> 01:29:59,803
Catch it.

1518
01:30:02,598 --> 01:30:03,303
Hello.

1519
01:30:03,632 --> 01:30:04,872
Dimpy, Samrat. Where are you?

1520
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:06,474
I am about to reach Mall Road.

1521
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:08,143
Okay.

1522
01:30:08,203 --> 01:30:09,944
Hold your nerves and
listen to me carefully.

1523
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:12,214
Don't reduce the car
speed to 50 or less.

1524
01:30:13,809 --> 01:30:14,719
But Why?

1525
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:16,684
There's a bomb in the car. - What?

1526
01:30:17,079 --> 01:30:17,853
Dimpy, don't worry.

1527
01:30:17,946 --> 01:30:19,448
Do you trust me? - Yes, but""

1528
01:30:19,548 --> 01:30:21,027
Dimpy, do as I say.

1529
01:30:21,483 --> 01:30:22,985
Just don't reduce the
speed.

1530
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:24,889
Okay.

1531
01:31:05,527 --> 01:31:06,437
S**t.

1532
01:31:13,535 --> 01:31:14,536
Come on, Samrat focus.

1533
01:31:14,836 --> 01:31:15,906
Dimpy's car will cross Mall Road""

1534
01:31:16,004 --> 01:31:17,415
<i>âand head towards Banjoâ Cross road.</i>

1535
01:31:17,773 --> 01:31:19,377
If the car's travelling at 60..

1536
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:20,509
..then it will take
3 minutes to get there.

1537
01:31:20,876 --> 01:31:21,854
IfI take the Civil Court road""

1538
01:31:21,943 --> 01:31:23,286
..then it will take me the same time.

1539
01:31:23,612 --> 01:31:24,955
But ifI take the Old Market route..

1540
01:31:25,013 --> 01:31:26,151
..then I might get there soonen.

1541
01:31:30,385 --> 01:31:31,090
Mister, what are you doing?

1542
01:31:31,386 --> 01:31:32,296
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

1543
01:31:34,823 --> 01:31:35,597
Hey""

1544
01:31:44,299 --> 01:31:45,004
Mister..

1545
01:32:04,686 --> 01:32:06,927
Who's that?
Stop.

1546
01:33:09,084 --> 01:33:09,789
Oh, my God!

1547
01:33:18,226 --> 01:33:19,296
Samrat.

1548
01:33:24,466 --> 01:33:25,240
Hi.

1549
01:33:25,467 --> 01:33:26,241
All well?

1550
01:33:29,504 --> 01:33:30,278
Okay.

1551
01:33:31,139 --> 01:33:34,677
Do you trust me?
- I trust you.

1552
01:33:35,977 --> 01:33:37,012
Alright.

1553
01:33:37,479 --> 01:33:38,719
Alright.

1554
01:33:39,347 --> 01:33:40,485
Let's jump.

1555
01:34:29,531 --> 01:34:30,271
Samrat.

1556
01:34:31,533 --> 01:34:33,274
Samrat. Thank you so much.

1557
01:34:33,768 --> 01:34:34,746
I am really obliged.

1558
01:34:35,570 --> 01:34:36,571
Are you okay?

1559
01:34:37,072 --> 01:34:38,244
Look, Mr. Sanjay.. - Doctor.

1560
01:34:39,074 --> 01:34:40,382
Nothing to worry about.

1561
01:34:40,609 --> 01:34:42,350
She was unconscious due to the shock.

1562
01:34:42,610 --> 01:34:43,714
There are few minor injuries.

1563
01:34:43,778 --> 01:34:45,052
I've given her first aid.

1564
01:34:46,348 --> 01:34:47,349
Thank you, doctor.

1565
01:34:47,549 --> 01:34:49,119
When can we take Dimpy home?

1566
01:34:49,384 --> 01:34:50,590
You can take her home now.

1567
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:53,831
STD... STD...

1568
01:34:54,723 --> 01:34:56,600
How did this happen?
Are you okay?

1569
01:34:56,658 --> 01:34:58,365
He's more restless than us, CD.

1570
01:35:00,128 --> 01:35:01,198
Yes, Khalid, I am fine.

1571
01:35:01,629 --> 01:35:02,505
I've texted you a number.

1572
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:03,838
Just find out whom does it belong to.

1573
01:35:04,332 --> 01:35:07,245
Fine, you'll have all
the details by tomorrow morning.

1574
01:35:08,570 --> 01:35:09,571
Okay.

1575
01:35:09,737 --> 01:35:11,580
We just need to wait
for tomorrow morning.

1576
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:13,145
Tomorrow's dawn will. .

1577
01:35:13,441 --> 01:35:15,580
.. clear out all the
darkness off this case.

1578
01:35:16,110 --> 01:35:17,384
What a story!

1579
01:35:17,813 --> 01:35:19,383
Murderer plants bomb in the car.

1580
01:35:19,814 --> 01:35:21,122
Beautiful girl in the car.

1581
01:35:21,416 --> 01:35:25,592
Samrat risks his life to save""

1582
01:35:26,488 --> 01:35:27,592
Coming.

1583
01:35:34,329 --> 01:35:35,637
There's no one.

1584
01:35:36,965 --> 01:35:38,501
Look down.

1585
01:35:39,968 --> 01:35:43,677
B...B...Bomb..

1586
01:35:44,172 --> 01:35:45,207
Chakradharji...

1587
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:47,078
Don't touch it. Don't go so close.

1588
01:35:47,575 --> 01:35:49,782
B...B...Bomb..

1589
01:35:50,011 --> 01:35:51,354
No...don't open it.

1590
01:35:51,613 --> 01:35:53,251
Look, I am elder to you.

1591
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:54,651
Listen to me.

1592
01:35:54,749 --> 01:35:56,319
Stop, Samrat.

1593
01:36:03,491 --> 01:36:04,799
What you during, sir?

1594
01:36:06,728 --> 01:36:07,729
Yoga.

1595
01:36:08,830 --> 01:36:10,138
Bomb-phat asan.

1596
01:36:40,195 --> 01:36:45,195
""How do I...thank you now?""

1597
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:56,740
""How do I...thank you now?""

1598
01:37:03,117 --> 01:37:08,117
""How do I...repay your love.""

1599
01:37:14,396 --> 01:37:20,108
""Your silence conveyed everything.""

1600
01:37:20,535 --> 01:37:25,678
""Your generous heart swept me away.""

1601
01:37:26,074 --> 01:37:35,620
""I'm beginning to
trust you completely.""

1602
01:37:37,419 --> 01:37:42,419
""I feel safe around you...says my soul.""

1603
01:37:48,763 --> 01:37:58,081
""How do I...thank you now?""

1604
01:37:58,706 --> 01:38:00,117
Thanks for the gift.

1605
01:38:01,276 --> 01:38:02,755
Thanks to you, Samrat.

1606
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:07,751
I mean if you..
I mean"" - You're welcome.

1607
01:38:10,018 --> 01:38:11,520
But I was only saving my life.

1608
01:38:14,689 --> 01:38:17,499
Actually, the bomb was in my car..

1609
01:38:17,525 --> 01:38:18,833
..so I was the target.

1610
01:38:19,494 --> 01:38:21,667
You were going to
unintentionally die my death.

1611
01:38:24,299 --> 01:38:26,472
I would've done it
intentionally as well.

1612
01:38:28,302 --> 01:38:32,011
What? - Forget it.

1613
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:37,981
Another strange thing.

1614
01:38:38,379 --> 01:38:40,086
The phone's registered
in the name of the dead gardener..

1615
01:38:40,381 --> 01:38:43,089
""who was fired from
the job for stealing.

1616
01:38:44,018 --> 01:38:45,122
The phone's switched off.

1617
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:48,131
But it was switched on
a while ago in Mahendra Mansion.

1618
01:38:48,423 --> 01:38:49,561
Good morning, sir.

1619
01:38:50,425 --> 01:38:53,497
That means someone has
untied the knot Belgium Baba tied.

1620
01:38:53,862 --> 01:38:55,136
The gardener's ghost is back.

1621
01:38:55,530 --> 01:38:56,668
Another shocking news.

1622
01:38:57,132 --> 01:39:00,045
From the phone's call
history we've learnt that..

1623
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:02,539
..that it's been frequently
calling Satyadev Baba.

1624
01:39:03,137 --> 01:39:04,707
That means the ghost has made""

1625
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:06,680
..an arrangement with the Baba.

1626
01:39:07,075 --> 01:39:07,849
Hotline.

1627
01:39:08,343 --> 01:39:09,617
Baba has just returned from Belgium.

1628
01:39:10,545 --> 01:39:11,853
He has a small hermitage close-by.

1629
01:39:26,995 --> 01:39:29,236
He's an adopted child? Sure?

1630
01:39:29,497 --> 01:39:30,271
Glory to thee!

1631
01:39:31,132 --> 01:39:32,543
Glory to thee!

1632
01:39:34,135 --> 01:39:35,614
Baba's waiting for you.

1633
01:39:42,510 --> 01:39:43,648
Baba!

1634
01:39:48,883 --> 01:39:49,987
<i>Satyadev Babe.</i>

1635
01:39:57,992 --> 01:39:59,130
Oh, God!

1636
01:39:59,427 --> 01:40:00,770
Baba's closed for business.

1637
01:40:09,203 --> 01:40:10,682
It's the same dead gardener's number.

1638
01:40:12,073 --> 01:40:14,075
CD, talk to him in Baba's voice.

1639
01:40:14,175 --> 01:40:15,085
Talk to a ghost!

1640
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:16,746
Say Glory to thee... talk to him.

1641
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:17,989
Okay.

1642
01:40:20,448 --> 01:40:21,688
Glory to thee...

1643
01:40:22,150 --> 01:40:23,390
Glory to thee...

1644
01:40:23,551 --> 01:40:24,552
Failure to thee.

1645
01:40:24,952 --> 01:40:26,022
Failure to thee.

1646
01:40:26,454 --> 01:40:27,558
Greetings, Baba.

1647
01:40:28,156 --> 01:40:31,103
I am really sad to
know that you're dead.

1648
01:40:32,093 --> 01:40:33,663
CD, give the phone to Samrat.

1649
01:40:37,365 --> 01:40:38,309
Samrat.

1650
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:50,715
I am coming.

1651
01:40:53,381 --> 01:40:54,621
Who was it?
- What was he saying?

1652
01:40:54,983 --> 01:40:56,519
Where are you going?
- Listen.

1653
01:40:56,584 --> 01:40:57,585
Samrat.

1654
01:40:58,119 --> 01:40:59,655
Questions! Questions! More questions!

1655
01:40:59,987 --> 01:41:00,761
I am just fed up.

1656
01:41:01,155 --> 01:41:01,758
Wait for my call.

1657
01:41:01,989 --> 01:41:03,764
Wait.
- Don't go alone.

1658
01:41:04,091 --> 01:41:04,762
Where are you going?

1659
01:41:04,992 --> 01:41:06,096
We're coming along.
Samrat.

1660
01:41:07,128 --> 01:41:08,163
Samrat.

1661
01:41:08,696 --> 01:41:10,198
Stop. Where are you going without me?

1662
01:41:10,298 --> 01:41:11,276
Please listen to me.

1663
01:41:11,465 --> 01:41:12,273
Samrat.

1664
01:41:12,333 --> 01:41:13,277
Samrat.

1665
01:41:13,468 --> 01:41:14,446
Samrat.

1666
01:41:15,736 --> 01:41:18,945
Where did he go?
- Maybe to get beaten up.

1667
01:41:20,241 --> 01:41:20,946
What?

1668
01:41:51,873 --> 01:41:54,183
Deepak (Lamp) can
clear the darkness""

1669
01:41:54,976 --> 01:41:56,182
..or burn down the house.

1670
01:41:59,547 --> 01:42:02,926
I tried to explain to you...
to stay away from this fire.

1671
01:42:03,251 --> 01:42:05,390
I've a different way
to understand and explain.

1672
01:42:05,453 --> 01:42:07,490
Why didn't you kill
me before I got to the Baba?

1673
01:42:07,955 --> 01:42:10,595
That would've ended the story, STD.

1674
01:42:11,259 --> 01:42:13,830
The real fun is in agony.

1675
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:16,866
Won't you show me whethen.

1676
01:42:17,298 --> 01:42:19,778
..you're just as strong
as you are intelligent.

1677
01:42:20,435 --> 01:42:21,778
And if you're scared""

1678
01:42:22,003 --> 01:42:23,607
..then that's the way out.

1679
01:42:25,106 --> 01:42:26,483
Samrat knows his way.

1680
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:33,317
Not bad.

1681
01:42:34,015 --> 01:42:36,757
But you will 
ose...this time.

1682
01:42:37,385 --> 01:42:38,796
Winning is my nature, Deepak.

1683
01:42:39,053 --> 01:42:41,294
My challenge at Mahendra
Pratap's memorial scared you.

1684
01:42:41,389 --> 01:42:43,130
And due to that fear
you started losing.

1685
01:42:44,125 --> 01:42:45,604
By planting a fake bomb in my car.

1686
01:42:51,633 --> 01:42:53,544
What? - Yes.

1687
01:42:53,968 --> 01:42:54,844
The watch on the bomb""

1688
01:42:54,902 --> 01:42:56,006
..was from the pen
stand in your office.

1689
01:42:56,470 --> 01:42:58,882
I also saw the offer letter
from Dhanraj Group of Companies.

1690
01:42:59,374 --> 01:43:00,876
Refusing an offer
from such a big company""

1691
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:02,677
""to continue working
for Mahendra Pratap""

1692
01:43:02,811 --> 01:43:04,688
""wasn't for loyalty, but for revenge.

1693
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:07,250
Friends and foe never leave you alone.

1694
01:43:08,549 --> 01:43:09,892
And you're no friend.

1695
01:43:27,802 --> 01:43:29,804
Today morning I also
received news from Bengaluru.

1696
01:43:30,138 --> 01:43:31,378
'He's an adopted child.'

1697
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:34,315
And then it wasn't difficult to find..

1698
01:43:34,375 --> 01:43:35,854
...that you're the kid whose familyâ.

1699
01:43:35,943 --> 01:43:37,547
""Mahendra Pratap Singh
had killed years ago""

1700
01:43:37,645 --> 01:43:38,953
..and you came here for revenge.

1701
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:40,953
'There was one body missing.'

1702
01:43:41,549 --> 01:43:43,722
'His 7 year old son.'

1703
01:43:46,587 --> 01:43:50,296
I would've come to you
even if you hadn't called.

1704
01:43:50,992 --> 01:43:52,630
I came here to kill Mahendra Pratap.

1705
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:53,665
Kill him by ruining him.

1706
01:43:53,961 --> 01:43:55,099
I was looking for
the right opportunity.

1707
01:43:55,163 --> 01:43:56,608
And as soon as I learnt
about the gardenen.

1708
01:43:56,664 --> 01:43:57,972
..I took advantage.

1709
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:10,480
Then I hired a horticulturist.

1710
01:44:11,813 --> 01:44:13,053
Made him wither the garden.

1711
01:44:16,017 --> 01:44:17,496
And manipulated the
forensic analysis.

1712
01:44:17,552 --> 01:44:19,156
And then tampered
the CCTV footages""

1713
01:44:19,453 --> 01:44:21,490
..and spread the rumor about a ghost.

1714
01:44:24,359 --> 01:44:27,101
Then you introduced that
fake baba to Mahendra Pratap.

1715
01:44:27,795 --> 01:44:28,796
So that he pretends
to drive away the ghost..

1716
01:44:28,863 --> 01:44:30,536
..and Mahendra Pratap
develops faith in him.

1717
01:44:30,798 --> 01:44:32,277
So that you can ruin his business""

1718
01:44:32,333 --> 01:44:34,643
..in the name of stars
and constellations.

1719
01:44:35,003 --> 01:44:36,004
Exactly.

1720
01:44:36,304 --> 01:44:37,942
Two days before the baba arrived..

1721
01:44:38,039 --> 01:44:39,575
..I asked the horticulturist
to stop putting the chemicals.

1722
01:44:39,874 --> 01:44:42,115
So that the garden turns green
again after the havan (chanting).

1723
01:44:42,843 --> 01:44:45,255
But your garden and
ghost idea flopped.

1724
01:44:45,613 --> 01:44:49,459
Because Mahendra Pratap Singh
was scared of something else.

1725
01:44:50,518 --> 01:44:51,792
Mahendra had commited
many sins in his lifeâ.

1726
01:44:52,019 --> 01:44:54,226
..and his guilt was
the reason of his fear.

1727
01:44:54,689 --> 01:44:56,862
If that rascal Anuj
hadn't interfered..

1728
01:44:56,957 --> 01:44:58,732
..then my plan would've
been successful.

1729
01:44:59,227 --> 01:45:01,400
Baba, everything's
going according to plan.

1730
01:45:02,363 --> 01:45:03,842
And after you drove
away the imaginary ghost""

1731
01:45:04,065 --> 01:45:05,840
""Mahendra Pratap
trusts you completely.

1732
01:45:07,234 --> 01:45:09,612
Here...the reward for your efforts.

1733
01:45:13,074 --> 01:45:14,815
Greetings, Baba. Greetings.

1734
01:45:15,543 --> 01:45:18,217
I came to seek your blessings.

1735
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:19,753
Glory to thee.

1736
01:45:20,014 --> 01:45:21,618
Glory to thee.

1737
01:45:30,691 --> 01:45:31,795
Hello.

1738
01:45:32,493 --> 01:45:37,306
Dimpy, I want to tell you
a secret related to your family.

1739
01:45:38,032 --> 01:45:39,409
No, no, not now.

1740
01:45:40,167 --> 01:45:41,578
I'll tell you when we meet.

1741
01:45:44,038 --> 01:45:48,783
Deepak, make me a
shareholder in your company.

1742
01:45:49,043 --> 01:45:51,785
How much do you want?
- For now, 2.5 million will do.

1743
01:45:52,413 --> 01:45:53,551
But keep your mouth shut!

1744
01:45:54,048 --> 01:45:55,083
Sure.

1745
01:46:02,123 --> 01:46:03,124
That loser.

1746
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:04,567
He was black mailing me! Me?

1747
01:46:05,225 --> 01:46:07,501
I thought I'll dump
his body after the party.

1748
01:46:07,995 --> 01:46:09,668
But Mahendra Pratap got murdered.

1749
01:46:12,433 --> 01:46:13,503
What?

1750
01:46:14,435 --> 01:46:15,573
Didn't you kill Mahendra Pratap?

1751
01:46:15,670 --> 01:46:17,581
I'll regret this till I live.

1752
01:46:17,671 --> 01:46:18,843
I didn't want to kill him so easily""

1753
01:46:18,906 --> 01:46:21,045
..in fact, I wanted to ruin
him and torture him to death.

1754
01:46:21,409 --> 01:46:22,513
But that sinner washed his sins..

1755
01:46:22,543 --> 01:46:23,851
..by changing the will.

1756
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:53,945
Good kick.

1757
01:46:55,376 --> 01:46:57,947
Why did you have to kill your
crime partner that fake Baba?

1758
01:46:58,880 --> 01:46:59,950
He was on your side.

1759
01:47:03,784 --> 01:47:05,730
I thought I'll do one
good deed before I go.

1760
01:47:06,854 --> 01:47:08,856
There will be one less
burden off this planet.

1761
01:47:10,725 --> 01:47:11,703
I see.

1762
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:14,631
So finally, tell me
why did you kill Hari?

1763
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:17,534
I didn't kill him either.

1764
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:19,137
What would I gain..

1765
01:47:19,433 --> 01:47:20,434
.. by killing that
stupid mimicry artist?

1766
01:47:22,670 --> 01:47:24,411
I feel sad for him.

1767
01:47:27,141 --> 01:47:28,415
And I feel sad for you.

1768
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:41,065
After Mahendra Pratap's death""

1769
01:47:41,122 --> 01:47:42,567
..I've no motive to live.

1770
01:47:43,057 --> 01:47:46,664
And who better than you would know
how boring life is without a motive.

1771
01:47:49,196 --> 01:47:51,699
See...I won.

1772
01:48:10,217 --> 01:48:13,630
Those who live. . .win.

Samrat. Are you fine?
- Are you okay.

Oh, God.

1776
01:48:28,536 --> 01:48:31,016
Everyone get down, quick.
- Yes, sir.

1777
01:48:32,539 --> 01:48:34,246
'Mahendra Pratap got murdered.'

1778
01:48:34,909 --> 01:48:37,185
'What would I gain by killing
that stupid mimicry artist?'

1779
01:48:39,547 --> 01:48:41,390
'Vijay Dinanath Chauhan.'

1780
01:48:41,682 --> 01:48:44,162
'If you're pushing your car,
then you're alive.'

1781

'I love you Anjali.'

'Car, bungalow, fame, fortune.'

'I want everything, sir. Everything.'

'But I am in a hurry, sir.'

'I'll be back in an hour or two.'

'Hari's leaving for Mumbai tomorrow.'

1787
01:48:58,833 --> 01:49:00,073
'Case of hit and run.'

1788
01:49:02,670 --> 01:49:04,877
Samrat, you fool!

1789
01:49:05,706 --> 01:49:07,379
Everything was right
before your eyes..

1790
01:49:07,675 --> 01:49:09,416
..and you couldn't
understand anything.

1791
01:49:10,077 --> 01:49:12,455
How could you miss Hari?

1792
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:16,261
You're such a big fool.
- Who?

1793
01:49:16,951 --> 01:49:19,431
Who's a big fool, Samrat?
- Me, CD.

1794
01:49:19,653 --> 01:49:20,427
I am a big fool!

1795
01:49:20,921 --> 01:49:22,764
Puran kaka and Vijay, both
were telling the truth.

1796
01:49:23,123 --> 01:49:25,899
How can two opposite versions
be true at the same time?

1797
01:49:26,294 --> 01:49:28,797
When there's a third lie.

1798
01:49:29,297 --> 01:49:30,435
Third lie?

1799
01:49:31,365 --> 01:49:35,404
This story's going to
end where it started, CD.

1800
01:49:36,169 --> 01:49:38,012
Let's prove it.
- How?

1801
01:49:39,340 --> 01:49:41,411
Mahendra Pratap Singh
will come himself""

1802
01:49:41,642 --> 01:49:42,643
""to name his murderer.

1803
01:49:43,043 --> 01:49:44,386
But he's""

1804
01:49:44,812 --> 01:49:46,382
Spirits come and go, CD.

1805
01:49:46,848 --> 01:49:47,883
Come on.

1806
01:49:56,557 --> 01:49:57,865
I am Vikramjeet.

1807
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:01,398
I am not some baba or tantric.

1808
01:50:02,696 --> 01:50:04,676
I am an astrophysicist.

1809
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:08,844
I've done extensive
research on planchette.

1810
01:50:10,904 --> 01:50:15,944
Planchette is one of the oldest
and scientific ways..

1811
01:50:16,677 --> 01:50:18,179
""to call a spirit.

1812
01:50:18,813 --> 01:50:22,192
To find the real killer..

1813
01:50:22,249 --> 01:50:25,594
""we're going to call
Mahendra Pratap's spirit.

1814
01:50:27,822 --> 01:50:32,328
In planchette, we need a medium.

1815
01:50:34,228 --> 01:50:37,801
And through that we talk to spirits.

1816
01:50:40,467 --> 01:50:44,506
And today our medium will be Mr.
Chakradhar.

1817
01:50:50,711 --> 01:50:53,521
Now all of you close your eyes""

1818
01:50:54,215 --> 01:50:56,525
..and think about Mahendra Pratap.

1819
01:51:36,123 --> 01:51:41,436
Mr. Mahendra Pratapmare
you amongst us?

1820
01:51:48,903 --> 01:51:50,348
Yes.

1821
01:51:57,344 --> 01:52:01,383
If this is what you call
being present, then I am.

1822
01:52:02,282 --> 01:52:04,785
A man can die but once.

1823
01:52:05,119 --> 01:52:08,066
Did your younger son Vijay kill you?

1824
01:52:12,359 --> 01:52:15,397
He's my blood...

1825
01:52:15,830 --> 01:52:18,106
""but someone else
has my blood on his hands.

1826
01:52:18,599 --> 01:52:19,703
Who?

1827
01:52:19,967 --> 01:52:21,275
Who is it?

1828
01:52:46,894 --> 01:52:48,373
Divva?!

1829
01:52:49,096 --> 01:52:53,374
Even this world doesn't believe it.

1830
01:52:55,635 --> 01:52:57,376
But yes...

1831
01:53:22,129 --> 01:53:23,608
What nonsense is this?

1832
01:53:24,131 --> 01:53:25,439
Divya didn't kill papa.

1833
01:53:26,133 --> 01:53:27,237
And that wasn't papa.

1834
01:53:29,937 --> 01:53:31,143
Come, sir.

1835
01:53:32,773 --> 01:53:35,276
I guess there's
some ritual going on here.

1836
01:53:35,643 --> 01:53:38,055
Sorry, but we had to come.

1837
01:53:38,812 --> 01:53:42,021
We have an arrest warrant for Divya.

1838
01:53:42,516 --> 01:53:45,520
And we just found out""

1839
01:53:45,586 --> 01:53:48,760
..that the pillow used
to suffocate Mr. Mahendra..

1840
01:53:48,822 --> 01:53:50,130
..had Divya's fingerprints.

1841
01:53:51,458 --> 01:53:53,460
And we also have statements""

1842
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:54,966
""from few guests at that party..

1843
01:53:55,062 --> 01:53:56,268
""who say that they saw Divya..

1844
01:53:56,329 --> 01:53:58,275
..go into Mahedra Pratap's room""

1845
01:53:58,665 --> 01:54:00,303
""right before the murder.

1846
01:54:00,634 --> 01:54:04,172
Insp. Khalid, if it's about
fingerprints on the pillow""

1847
01:54:04,271 --> 01:54:06,182
""then it also has
Vijay's fingerprints.

1848
01:54:06,273 --> 01:54:08,310
But that doesn't mean he's the killer.

1849
01:54:08,542 --> 01:54:11,045
Sorry, we have enough proofs.

1850
01:54:11,678 --> 01:54:13,123
And as far as you're concerned.

1851
01:54:13,914 --> 01:54:15,291
You can prove it in the court.

1852
01:54:15,849 --> 01:54:18,193
You don't get it,
Divya can never do such a thing.

1853
01:54:18,585 --> 01:54:21,065
She has tried to do
something similar before.

1854
01:54:21,588 --> 01:54:23,124
She attacked CD.

1855
01:54:23,991 --> 01:54:25,026
That was a coincidence.

1856
01:54:25,125 --> 01:54:27,503
Coincidences don't occur every day,
Mr. Sanjay.

1857
01:54:27,594 --> 01:54:29,540
She has attacked the
servants of this house too.

1858
01:54:29,629 --> 01:54:30,699
Trust me, this is a lie.

1859
01:54:30,998 --> 01:54:31,703
Then what's the truth?

1860
01:54:32,032 --> 01:54:33,705
The doctors suggested to
send her to a mental asylumâ.

1861
01:54:33,967 --> 01:54:35,708
""but your love kept her here.

1862
01:54:35,936 --> 01:54:37,074
This is a conspiracy.

1863
01:54:37,171 --> 01:54:39,515
Divya can never do such a thing?
- Why can't she?

1864
01:54:40,374 --> 01:54:41,717
Divya's mental condition got worse""

1865
01:54:41,942 --> 01:54:43,512
""after she saw her
mother commit suicide.

1866
01:54:43,944 --> 01:54:45,514
She started hating her father.

1867
01:54:45,946 --> 01:54:47,721
On his 60th birthday,
when she had the fits again..

1868
01:54:47,948 --> 01:54:49,325
""she was out of control.

1869
01:54:49,416 --> 01:54:50,394
She then went to his room""

1870
01:54:50,451 --> 01:54:52,124
..and strangled him with a pillow.

1871
01:54:52,620 --> 01:54:53,724
That's a lie.

1872
01:54:54,988 --> 01:54:56,695
Divya didn't hate papa.

1873
01:54:57,524 --> 01:54:59,731
And the fingerprints
on the pillow aren't Divya's.

1874
01:55:00,393 --> 01:55:01,736
They can't be Divya's fingerprints!

1875
01:55:01,996 --> 01:55:03,634
Absolutely right, Mr. Sanjay.

1876
01:55:03,997 --> 01:55:04,737
But how do you know""

1877
01:55:05,031 --> 01:55:06,738
""those weren't Divya's
fingerprints on the pillow?

1878
01:55:10,203 --> 01:55:11,273
I'll tell you...

1879
01:55:13,474 --> 01:55:16,045
Because while killing
Mahendra Pratap""

1880
01:55:16,310 --> 01:55:18,017
..you were wearing gloves!

1881
01:55:18,212 --> 01:55:19,885
You killed Mahendra Pratap!

1882
01:55:20,247 --> 01:55:22,784
You're the killer, Mr. Sanjay..!!
- Yes, yes!!

1883
01:55:22,883 --> 01:55:25,295
I killed him!

1884
01:55:27,087 --> 01:55:29,966
I hated him.

1885
01:55:33,193 --> 01:55:35,332
Truth is that light..

1886
01:55:35,596 --> 01:55:38,042
..which can be seen even before dawn.

1887
01:55:38,632 --> 01:55:41,203
Thank you, Khalid, for helping me.
- Pleasure.

1888
01:55:41,302 --> 01:55:43,339
And bravo,
sub-inspector Vikramjeet Singh..

1889
01:55:43,570 --> 01:55:44,913
..for your outstanding performance.
- Thank you.

1890
01:55:45,005 --> 01:55:46,348
CD, you're brilliant.

1891
01:55:47,007 --> 01:55:50,682
I had my doubts when
I saw the phone in it's place.

1892
01:55:51,111 --> 01:55:52,784
But my doubts were confirmed""

1893
01:55:52,879 --> 01:55:54,654
""when I kept a sample of mud..

1894
01:55:54,781 --> 01:55:56,055
""from Hari's murder spot.

1895
01:55:56,116 --> 01:55:59,097
And I found the same
mud on your car's tires.

1896
01:56:01,355 --> 01:56:03,596
I was convinced, but confused too.

1897
01:56:03,857 --> 01:56:04,995
But when Deepak said
he has nothing to gain..

1898
01:56:05,058 --> 01:56:06,537
..by killing a mimicry
artist like Hari..

1899
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:08,369
..that's when I understood""

1900
01:56:08,428 --> 01:56:09,907
..that you have everything
to gain from it.

1901
01:56:12,532 --> 01:56:14,443
I had no other way to prove""

1902
01:56:14,535 --> 01:56:15,605
..that you are the murderer.

1903
01:56:16,270 --> 01:56:17,874
That's why I had to pick this option.

1904
01:56:29,516 --> 01:56:31,996
My mother committed
suicide because of my father.

1905
01:56:33,486 --> 01:56:36,558
He's responsible for
my sister's condition.

1906
01:56:40,293 --> 01:56:42,364
I hated him from the core of my heart.

1907
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:46,401
After coercing my mother
to committing suicide..

1908
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:48,446
..papa got married again.

1909
01:56:49,870 --> 01:56:52,578
I could never accept Vijay.

1910
01:56:55,209 --> 01:56:57,086
And that's why..

1911
01:56:57,377 --> 01:56:59,584
..you showered false
love on your step-brothen.

1912
01:56:59,847 --> 01:57:01,121
..and spoiled him.

1913
01:57:01,381 --> 01:57:03,019
So that he turned
out good for nothing...

1914
01:57:03,383 --> 01:57:05,329
And even lost respect
in his dad's eyes.

1915
01:57:06,853 --> 01:57:08,628
You could see the entire
property in your name..

1916
01:57:08,856 --> 01:57:11,234
""but you got a shock when""

1917
01:57:11,325 --> 01:57:14,636
..in the first will, your dad divided
the property equally.

1918
01:57:15,696 --> 01:57:18,267
You were furious,
but you lost control..

1919
01:57:18,331 --> 01:57:19,503
""when you found out that""

1920
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:21,545
âyour papa is going
to change his willâ.

1921
01:57:21,635 --> 01:57:23,672
..and donate half
his property to charity,

1922
01:57:24,137 --> 01:57:26,640
you decided that before
he changes his willâ.

1923
01:57:26,774 --> 01:57:28,082
..you will change his world.

1924
01:57:28,174 --> 01:57:29,482
And put the blame on Vijay.

1925
01:57:30,243 --> 01:57:31,745
Thus, complete control over
the entire property.

1926
01:57:32,045 --> 01:57:33,251
But so sad.

1927
01:57:33,847 --> 01:57:35,349
You had no clue that""

1928
01:57:35,415 --> 01:57:38,555
""Mahendra Pratap had
already signed his new will.

1929
01:57:39,052 --> 01:57:42,431
An important part
of your plan was Hari,

1930
01:57:42,489 --> 01:57:43,490
the mimicry artist.

1931
01:57:43,790 --> 01:57:45,098
It was his voice that Puran Kaka..

1932
01:57:45,159 --> 01:57:46,502
..and Vijay heard that night.

1933
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:48,030
Right?

1934
01:57:50,797 --> 01:57:53,539
That night, after calming Divya..

1935
01:57:55,369 --> 01:57:56,507
..I spoke to Hari.

1936
01:57:57,337 --> 01:57:58,247
Hello.

1937
01:57:58,806 --> 01:58:02,379
You always look for ways
to make money the easy way.

1938
01:58:04,511 --> 01:58:06,115
I will give you 1 million.

1939
01:58:06,513 --> 01:58:07,890
And your first break too.

1940
01:58:09,282 --> 01:58:11,387
You just need to show your talent.

1941
01:58:13,086 --> 01:58:14,121
He agreed.

1942
01:58:14,454 --> 01:58:16,331
My job became easier.

1943
01:58:53,794 --> 01:58:56,968
Then I took papa's phone to Hari.

1944
01:59:03,870 --> 01:59:07,215
Hello. - Bring a
jug of water to my room, Puran.

1945
01:59:08,008 --> 01:59:10,215
I want money, and that's it.

1946
01:59:11,445 --> 01:59:15,154
Yes, papa. - Vijay, come to my room.

1947
01:59:16,216 --> 01:59:18,924
And the next day I kept
the phone back in papa's room.

1948
01:59:19,386 --> 01:59:21,923
Hari was unaware that when
he was doing all this..

1949
01:59:22,022 --> 01:59:23,899
.. he's going
to be a part of a murder.

1950
01:59:24,457 --> 01:59:27,131
But when he realized
this, he was very scared.

1951
01:59:27,761 --> 01:59:29,138
And was preparing to flee.

1952
01:59:30,063 --> 01:59:32,339
Sanjay thought that I am after Hari.

1953
01:59:33,033 --> 01:59:35,013
That's when he called
Hari to a secluded spot""

1954
01:59:35,101 --> 01:59:36,045
..on the pretext of paying
the rest of the money.

1955
01:59:36,136 --> 01:59:37,877
But he killed him instead.

1956
01:59:50,784 --> 01:59:51,819
Come with us.

1957
01:59:54,855 --> 01:59:56,493
You knew about your
husband's intentions..

1958
01:59:56,790 --> 01:59:58,133
..and his crime.

1959
02:00:00,861 --> 02:00:02,306
You were scared that
I might uncover him.

1960
02:00:02,362 --> 02:00:04,035
So you often followed me.

1961
02:00:05,031 --> 02:00:07,375
You even searched my room that day.

1962
02:00:07,667 --> 02:00:09,704
'Someone came into this
room two minutes ago.'

1963
02:00:11,171 --> 02:00:15,677
But...fear doesn't change
or hide the truth.

1964
02:00:47,307 --> 02:00:48,012
Shall we, CD.

1965
02:00:48,541 --> 02:00:51,021
By the way,
you're making more fans by the day.

1966
02:00:51,978 --> 02:00:53,013

02:00:59,386 --> 02:01:02,629
We couldn't find Deepak's body.

1969
02:01:05,358 --> 02:01:09,500
Did you really
expectmto find his body?

1970
02:01:34,054 --> 02:01:36,432
Samrat. Thank you.

1971
02:01:37,590 --> 02:01:39,797
I don't know whether
I should be happy or sad.

1972
02:01:40,293 --> 02:01:41,795
That's life.

1973
02:01:43,596 --> 02:01:45,803
Yes, this is for you.

1974
02:01:48,401 --> 02:01:49,471
Thank you.

1975
02:01:49,669 --> 02:01:50,807
Money is the 8th sense..

1976
02:01:51,071 --> 02:01:53,642
..that lets us enjoy the other senses.

1977
02:01:54,474 --> 02:01:55,475
Samrat.

1978
02:01:56,176 --> 02:01:57,746
Someone's sent this bouquet for you.

1979
02:01:58,345 --> 02:01:59,824
But I can't figure
out what's written on it.

1980
02:02:09,089 --> 02:02:11,433
Some riddles are best left unsolved.

1981
02:02:12,692 --> 02:02:13,602
Thanks.

1982
02:02:17,597 --> 02:02:18,473
Samrat.

02:02:23,003 --> 02:02:24,778
If I ever need you againâ.

1984
02:02:25,004 --> 02:02:26,779
...will I have to suffer
the journey again...

1985
02:02:28,508 --> 02:02:29,612
Or can I give you a call?

1986
02:02:33,380 --> 02:02:34,518
What are you thinking?

1987
02:02:35,448 --> 02:02:37,394
Answer that call and you'll
find me on the other side.

1988
02:02:39,252 --> 02:02:41,562
Save it.
- Thank you.

1989
02:02:42,722 --> 02:02:45,794
Do you have to go today?
- Yes.

1990
02:02:47,561 --> 02:02:48,801
But before I leave
I want to say something""

1991
02:02:49,095 --> 02:02:50,506
..which I have never
said to anyone before.

1992
02:02:51,030 --> 02:02:51,667
What?

1993
02:02:53,166 --> 02:02:54,201
We'll meet again.

1994
02:03:03,042 --> 02:03:04,817
I am fed up of this cold.

1995
02:03:06,179 --> 02:03:08,557
I am going to enjoy
the heat in Mumbai.

1996
02:03:09,048 --> 02:03:11,153
No work for an entire month.

1997
02:03:14,354 --> 02:03:15,264
Samrat.

1998
02:03:19,759 --> 02:03:20,760
What?

1999
02:03:23,263 --> 02:03:25,243
Fine, we'll be there.

2000
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:28,377
Guess what?

2001
02:03:28,435 --> 02:03:30,779
That was Her Highness Priyanka
Raghuvanshi of Dharamgatpur.

2002
02:03:31,237 --> 02:03:32,773
The 200 year old gold statue""

2003

Sangramaditya Raghuvanshi..

2004
02:03:34,374 --> 02:03:37,218
.. is shedding tears of blood.

2005
02:03:38,011 --> 02:03:40,048
We've to start working
on the case from tomorrow.

2006
02:03:40,380 --> 02:03:42,223
Tears from a golden statue?

2007
02:03:42,649 --> 02:03:44,219
And that too of blood.

2008
02:03:45,585 --> 02:03:48,657
We just got rid of one ghost,
and now there's another!

2009
02:03:48,755 --> 02:03:50,792
Why don't you take some normal case?

2010
02:03:51,758 --> 02:03:54,238
CD, easy challenges
are like broken pencils...

2011
02:03:55,094 --> 02:03:56,471
There's no point!

Sir, I am just leaving now.

Here take your money!
I gave 50 to that police officer.

This is 25, count it.

00:06:59,607 --> 00:07:02,793
Strange man!
If it's more, he won't take it!

00:08:39,195 --> 00:08:40,158
I'm sorry!

40
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:45,216
It is very difficult to
do a double shift in this old age.

41
00:08:45,753 --> 00:08:48,656
And you? You do three shifts!

42
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:51,936
What will you do
with so much money, son?

43
00:08:52,863 --> 00:08:54,527
I have debt that has to be repaid.

he misses, and reminds him again.'

the match is going to end very soon.'

00:09:41,678 --> 00:09:42,777
Idiot!

'It's almost a one sided match!'

57
00:09:49,224 --> 00:09:51,153
Hey! Why did you turn it off?

58
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:52,773
Change the channel!

59
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:54,663
It must be almost
in 8 o'clock in India.

60
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:56,678
Please, put on my channel.

61
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,065
What is this?
You still haven't watered this?

62
00:10:00,203 --> 00:10:03,476
I told you,
this has to be watered twice a day.

63
00:10:03,693 --> 00:10:05,105
How many times have I told you?

64
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:08,375
As soon as it's almost 8 o'clock
in India, turn on my channel.

65
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:09,946
When will you understand?

66
00:10:11,827 --> 00:10:12,551
Take this!

67
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,547
Take it!

68
00:10:15,112 --> 00:10:17,096
What are you waiting for?
Catch it!

69
00:10:18,707 --> 00:10:21,708
Now, what was the
need to bring all this...

70
00:10:23,487 --> 00:10:26,428
It's your favorite carrot pudding,
uncle Usman.

71
00:10:26,714 --> 00:10:30,654
Now, how many times have
I told you not to play with fire?

72
00:10:30,732 --> 00:10:33,468
But, you?
just blah- blah- blah- blah- blah!

73
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:36,990
If the lecture is over,
taste it and tell me how it tastes?

74
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:40,350
Here, come on!

75
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:42,618
I don't like sweets.

76
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:46,634
Who are you?

77
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,916
What are you doing
in uncle Usman's cabin?

78
00:10:51,071 --> 00:10:54,411
Uncle Usman has retired
today and I joined in his place.

79
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:55,329
Oh!

80
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:57,502
You're a native.

81
00:10:58,054 --> 00:10:59,331
Strange fool you are!

82
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:00,716
Couldn't you tell me before?

83
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,068
You didn't give me a chance!

84
00:11:02,144 --> 00:11:04,655
I will go to uncle Usman's
house and set him right!

85
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:06,312
Who just goes away without informing?

86
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,987
First of all, uncle Usman
is not here and to top it...

87
00:11:09,113 --> 00:11:11,660
I don't know whether Bindiya's
mother-in-law will agree or not.

88
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,073
Mother-in-law?

89
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,645
She is very strict!

90
00:11:14,994 --> 00:11:17,074
Poor Bindiya was just
about to apologize.

91
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:21,309
Now, her fat mother-in-law knows
she was lying to go to the office!

92
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,355
Who is Bindiya?

93
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:26,655
""I am the Bindiya (ornament)
of your forehead!""

94
00:11:26,731 --> 00:11:28,605
It's the biggest hit
on Indian television.

95
00:11:28,682 --> 00:11:29,435
Don't you watch it?

96
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:31,743
That's what uncle Usman
and I used to watch together.

97
00:11:32,436 --> 00:11:33,956
Today, he ditched me!

98
00:11:34,753 --> 00:11:38,175
Anyways,
if uncle Usman is not here, then...

99
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:41,693
I think I should leave, right?

100
00:11:47,337 --> 00:11:48,078
Okay!

101
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:50,815
I think I should go.

102
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,664
If you wish you can come inside.

103
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,482
No, thanks! I'm fine.

104
00:12:33,334 --> 00:12:35,284
The weather is bad and...

105
00:12:36,564 --> 00:12:39,061
Bindiya should have
reached home by now.

106
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:42,913
- And her mother-in-law...
- Fat and strict!

107
00:12:43,323 --> 00:12:44,885
I don't know how she's going to react.

108
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:50,704
What is her mother-in-law's name?

109
00:12:50,856 --> 00:12:51,596
Kalavati!

110
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:55,127
'Kalavati is the name
of truth and the idol of love.'

111
00:12:55,646 --> 00:12:57,430
'You have cheated Kalavati!'

112
00:12:57,508 --> 00:12:59,372
'Cheated! Cheated!'

113
00:12:59,605 --> 00:13:02,283
'Cheated! Cheated!'

114
00:13:02,746 --> 00:13:08,127
'But, you forgot that
Kalavati wears glasses...'

115
00:13:08,452 --> 00:13:11,063
so that if someone tries
to throw dust into her eyes...'

116
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:16,129
'the dust collides with
the glasses and falls to the ground!'

117
00:13:17,572 --> 00:13:21,869
'The bond of mother-in-law and
daughter-in-law is a fragile wall...'

118
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:27,039
'but, you have kicked
down the wall of belief!'

119
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,411
'No, mother!
I haven't done anything of the sort.'

120
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:34,267
'I value the honor of this
family even more than my life!'

121
00:13:34,835 --> 00:13:36,392
'Please forgive me!'

122
00:13:36,469 --> 00:13:38,146
'The Suryavanshi family...'

123
00:13:38,338 --> 00:13:44,621
'...then Kalavati will
not fail even once!'

124
00:13:45,651 --> 00:13:50,445
'I am the Bindiya of your forehead!'

125
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:03,014
You haven't eaten this!

126
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,628
And one more thing.

127
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,216
I am telling you because
uncle Usman is not here.

128
00:14:19,342 --> 00:14:22,132
This night jasmine has
to be watered twice a day.

129
00:14:22,385 --> 00:14:23,029
Yes.

130
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,301
Can I get the address
for gym Thunderstorm?

131
00:15:13,837 --> 00:15:14,870
Thank you.

132
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:28,628
Okay! So now, the structure we make,
needs a strong base.

133
00:16:28,926 --> 00:16:32,152
While learning clay modeling,
we need to start with the base...

134
00:16:32,473 --> 00:16:33,770
which is the armature.

135
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,279
So I hope all of you
are ready to learn...

136
00:16:36,357 --> 00:16:37,699
how to make you first armature.

137
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:39,017
Yes!

138
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:40,193
Very good!

139
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,586
So, armatures can be
made of different material.

140
00:16:42,662 --> 00:16:44,954
Like PWC pipes, wooden rods.

141
00:16:45,196 --> 00:16:47,564
Just depends on how sturdy
you want the structure to be.

142
00:16:47,694 --> 00:16:48,795
And you know...

143
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,856
You are so good, Jenny!

144
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:55,801
I mean, you are so hot!

145
00:16:56,608 --> 00:16:57,715
Thank you, Mr. Chang.

146
00:16:57,865 --> 00:17:00,796
I'm really, really impressed with you.

147
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,877
- What's your plan this evening?
- Me?

148
00:17:06,086 --> 00:17:07,370
Yeah! Of course, you!

149
00:17:07,447 --> 00:17:09,481
You definitely deserve a treat!

150
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,797
But today, Bindiya's husband will
take her on a romantic dinner date.

151
00:17:15,194 --> 00:17:15,918
What?

152
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:17,893
Sorry, Mr. Chang! I'm busy tonight.

153
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:20,167
8 o'clock, channel 22!
Do watch it!

154
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:21,745
Come on! Hit me harder!

155
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:26,999
Come on, punch harder!
Use your body weight!

156
00:17:33,825 --> 00:17:34,597
Stop!

157
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,680
Mercy is the boxer's biggest enemy!

158
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:40,920
Your opponent will
never do that for you!

159
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:45,921
So, box me harder now!
Come on! You can do it.

160
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,730
Use you left! Concentrate! Fight!

161
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:53,723
What happened?
Look here! Concentrate!

162
00:17:54,266 --> 00:17:55,962
- Suraj!
- What?

163
00:18:10,979 --> 00:18:13,405
I knew you would definitely
come here one day.

164
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:15,965
Come here you!

165
00:18:21,773 --> 00:18:23,766
Forget about the past, Bossy!

166
00:18:24,746 --> 00:18:26,367
You considered Suraj your own son.

167
00:18:26,974 --> 00:18:28,936
He has returned after 3 years.

168
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:31,463
Let's hug and start all over again.

169
00:18:32,183 --> 00:18:34,616
Trust me,
everything be like the old times.

170
00:18:37,697 --> 00:18:39,656
Come here! What did you do to me?

171
00:18:40,502 --> 00:18:41,497
Let me show you!

172
00:18:41,758 --> 00:18:44,257
Look here! Look!

173
00:18:44,571 --> 00:18:45,643
Look here!

174
00:18:46,698 --> 00:18:48,818
I had to leave that posh locality...

175
00:18:49,297 --> 00:18:51,898
and come and live here in this area!

176
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:56,578
I had a home which
I built with my hard work.

177
00:18:57,247 --> 00:18:58,322
It got sold.

178
00:18:59,501 --> 00:19:01,539
My wife loved me a lot.

179
00:19:01,964 --> 00:19:04,100
She left me and returned to India.

180
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,159
All because of you!

181
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,860
And you think that
I will hire you again!

182
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,519
I will trust you again.

183
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:16,738
I did not come here to ask for work.
I have come to apologize.

184
00:19:17,473 --> 00:19:18,301
Sorry.

185
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,121
You've come here to do me a favor.

186
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:23,062
Omi! He's come here to do me a favor.

187
00:19:23,743 --> 00:19:26,346
Why don't you say it clearly?
You've come to see...

188
00:19:26,422 --> 00:19:28,183
whether Srikant is still alive.

189
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:30,265
If he is alive, what is his plight?

190
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,576
Omi! Tell him...

191
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,018
Tell him to get out of my sight.

192
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,904
I never want to see his face again.
Get him out from here.

193
00:19:39,938 --> 00:19:41,002
Get him out!

194
00:19:47,078 --> 00:19:49,665
Suraj, you don't worry.
This guy is very haughty!

195
00:19:50,346 --> 00:19:51,745
But, he loves you.

196
00:19:52,051 --> 00:19:54,553
And his wife was going
to leave him anyway.

197
00:19:54,706 --> 00:19:56,426
Now come on,
I will introduce you to the others.

198
00:19:56,506 --> 00:19:57,719
Come on. Let's go.

199
00:20:01,506 --> 00:20:03,425
Come on, boys! Come on! Come here!

200
00:20:04,178 --> 00:20:06,349
Look who's here! This is Suraj.

201
00:20:06,836 --> 00:20:08,227
We used to call him ""Storm"".

202
00:20:08,388 --> 00:20:09,988
He was the champion in 2012.

203
00:20:10,112 --> 00:20:11,999
There used to be no one left
to face him in the final round.

204
00:20:12,076 --> 00:20:13,788
All the professional
players were defeated by him.

205
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:14,827
Hey Sikandar, come on here.

206
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:16,949
Nobody could play until
the last round with him.

207
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:18,037
That's Storm!

208
00:20:18,364 --> 00:20:19,592
And I was one of them.

209
00:20:19,989 --> 00:20:22,419
He knocked me out in 13 seconds.

210
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:23,789
Isn't it, Champ?

211
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,546
Sikandar!
Suraj, all these are old stories.

212
00:20:26,757 --> 00:20:29,509
But, he is no less today!
He has worked very hard on himself.

213
00:20:29,668 --> 00:20:32,279
He is the best MMA
fighter in Thunderstorm.

214
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,750
I saw him on TV. Not bad.

215
00:20:34,991 --> 00:20:35,953
Oh, really?

216
00:20:36,229 --> 00:20:37,249
Not bad!

217
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,909
Come on, then! Let's see.

218
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,072
What does good mean
and who is better?

219
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,670
I have given up fighting.

220
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:46,653
Why?

221
00:20:46,965 --> 00:20:48,480
Have you lost your power?

222
00:20:48,652 --> 00:20:50,673
- Or did you realize your true place?
- Sikander!

223
00:20:51,768 --> 00:20:53,713
This is not the time
for this useless conversation.

224
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:55,513
He hasn't worn gloves for 3 years.

225
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:57,940
It will be seen later,
who will win and who will lose.

226
00:20:58,812 --> 00:21:01,791
He gave up winning 3 years ago.

227
00:21:02,301 --> 00:21:04,314
At that time he was the shining sun.

228
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:06,429
Today, he is the setting sun.

229
00:21:06,506 --> 00:21:07,499
Come on, boss!

230
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,071
Okay, take it. Tell them.

231
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,864
Tell them how much
fire is still left in you.

232
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,768
- Boss, I have given up fighting.
- Boss!

233
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,756
Suraj!

234
00:21:17,915 --> 00:21:20,677
This place is for boxers.

235
00:21:21,002 --> 00:21:22,829
That too, only for winners.

236
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:27,658
Don't even think of looking this way,
forget about coming here!

237
00:21:31,895 --> 00:21:32,871
Suraj!

238
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:48,840
'She was looking great!'

239
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:50,051
'Why dinner tonight?'

240
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:53,880
'It's nobody's birthday,
nor anniversary!'

241
00:21:54,017 --> 00:21:55,297
'How can you say that, Bindiya?'

242
00:21:56,317 --> 00:21:59,232
'Don't we go out without an occasion?'

243
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,633
If you don't mind,
can you please open the window?

244
00:22:04,936 --> 00:22:07,598
Sorry, but I'm sensitive to smell.

245
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,219
Maybe you've had a work out,
that's why!

246
00:22:18,122 --> 00:22:20,289
What clothes have you worn today?

247
00:22:21,443 --> 00:22:24,048
It's a greenish T- shirt and...

248
00:22:24,236 --> 00:22:27,088
Silly! I'm not talking about you,
I'm asking about Bindiya!

249
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,367
What do her earrings look like?

250
00:22:32,737 --> 00:22:34,730
- Just like you!
- Really?

251
00:22:35,807 --> 00:22:38,926
Wow! Bindiya is wearing
earrings just like mine.

252
00:22:41,644 --> 00:22:45,709
Okay, now look at the TV and
tell me how Bindiya actually looks!

253
00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:53,472
- I'll just be back.
- Okay

254
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:56,435
'You don't call him a killer,
you call him a murderer!'

255
00:22:57,608 --> 00:23:00,128
'How does it matter whether
he is a killer or a murderer?'

256
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:02,375
'Will you kill me
now or after dinner?'

257
00:23:02,961 --> 00:23:05,456
'Bindiya! A little romance...'

258
00:23:06,306 --> 00:23:08,078
'My romance is not a joke!'

259
00:23:09,163 --> 00:23:12,955
'I am the bindiya (ornament)
on your forehead'

260
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:32,929
Thank you! Bye!

261
00:23:36,237 --> 00:23:37,192
Your...

262
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:40,465
tiffin.

263
00:23:43,293 --> 00:23:44,093
Thanks!

264
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:47,122
What is inside this?

265
00:23:47,814 --> 00:23:48,441
It's sugar.

266
00:23:48,692 --> 00:23:49,937
What! Why?

267
00:23:52,361 --> 00:23:53,948
- We're equal now.
- Oh, really?

268
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,295
Favor and debt, must be repaid
as soon as possible, Bindiya!

269
00:23:59,443 --> 00:24:03,136
Sometimes, you behave
like Bindiya's husband Jignesh!

270
00:24:04,856 --> 00:24:06,936
Anyway, I'm Jenny!

271
00:24:10,297 --> 00:24:13,287
I'm shaking your hand,
not asking for it!

272
00:24:19,336 --> 00:24:22,668
You are shy like a girl,
but your hand is quite solid.

273
00:24:22,868 --> 00:24:24,160
What do you do?

274
00:24:28,113 --> 00:24:28,871
Okay!

275
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:30,379
Bye! Thanks for the show.

276
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:32,139
And thanks for the sugar.

277
00:24:37,061 --> 00:24:46,421
""Sounds! Tell me, what are these
sounds that I can hear nowadays""

278
00:24:46,826 --> 00:24:55,102
""Knocking! Tell me, why are
these strange moments knocking?""

279
00:24:55,942 --> 00:24:58,542
I'm shaking your hand,
not asking for it!

280
00:24:58,941 --> 00:25:03,531
""There is something
that causes less sleep""

281
00:25:03,808 --> 00:25:08,587
""There is something
that makes the eyes moist""

282
00:25:08,664 --> 00:25:13,295
""There is something,
that if you say so""

283
00:25:13,526 --> 00:25:17,885
""I will lay down
my life with a smile!""

284
00:25:57,431 --> 00:26:06,314
""What can we call that
which exists between us?""

285
00:26:07,104 --> 00:26:16,098
""What is love? It is a wave...
Come, let's flow with it together""

286
00:26:16,356 --> 00:26:21,283
- ""Something that makes me lost""
- I'm talking about Bindiya, not you!

287
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:26,193
""There is something
that you could not sleep!""

288
00:26:26,273 --> 00:26:35,840
""There is something that
both of us laughed until we cried!""

289
00:26:58,377 --> 00:27:01,553
Hi! I'm so late!
Please, put the TV on.

290
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:06,638
There's water too?

291
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,031
New shoes?

292
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:12,786
No.

293
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,695
They're pretty old,
bought them quite sometime ago.

294
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:15,598
Okay.

295
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:19,238
What is Bindiya going to do today?

296
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,877
She is going to request her husband.

297
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:24,956
Jignesh is going to leave Bindiya
and go to Singapore for his new job.

298
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,800
Put the TV on, please.

299
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:31,521
- 'I don't want your money!'
- See? It's already started.

300
00:27:31,721 --> 00:27:35,482
'Why are you crying like this,
darling?'

301
00:27:35,561 --> 00:27:37,882
'I'm doing all this for you.'

302
00:27:38,058 --> 00:27:41,202
'I don't need your money! I need you!'

303
00:27:42,548 --> 00:27:46,919
'No matter what state we are in,
at least we are together.'

304
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,804
'Bindiya will not be able
to live without you, Jignesh!'

305
00:27:53,068 --> 00:27:56,254
'She will die!'

306
00:27:57,888 --> 00:28:00,604
'Bindiya!
Please don't say such things.'

307
00:28:01,525 --> 00:28:03,957
'I will die, before you.'

308
00:28:07,691 --> 00:28:10,565
'My life is tied to yours.'

309
00:28:11,386 --> 00:28:12,086
'Please!'

310
00:28:16,324 --> 00:28:18,067
'What should I do?'

311
00:28:18,714 --> 00:28:20,637
Jignesh is not doing the right thing!

312
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:25,545
You won't ever do that, right?

313
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:28,488
'I will be paid twice
as much money in Singapore.'

314
00:28:28,658 --> 00:28:29,448
What does that mean?

315
00:28:29,612 --> 00:28:32,640
That means that you will not
leave your girlfriend for a new job!

316
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:35,929
'I will work there
and take care of you.'

317
00:28:36,255 --> 00:28:37,448
It depends.

318
00:28:38,113 --> 00:28:39,253
It depends?

319
00:28:39,521 --> 00:28:41,123
What do you mean, it depends?

320
00:28:41,201 --> 00:28:44,146
What is more necessary for you?
Old relationships or a new job?

321
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,210
I will never leave her and go.

322
00:28:49,724 --> 00:28:50,608
Promise?

323
00:28:53,313 --> 00:28:54,234
Promise!

324
00:28:55,011 --> 00:28:56,257
Good!

325
00:28:56,475 --> 00:28:58,403
Your girlfriend is very lucky.

326
00:29:00,964 --> 00:29:02,675
I don't have a girlfriend.

327
00:29:03,036 --> 00:29:06,533
Silly! You don't have one,
but you will one day.

328
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:09,893
Wherever she is today,
she is very lucky.

329
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,577
Because it's you in her life,
not Jignesh.

330
00:29:15,594 --> 00:29:16,493
Handsome?

331
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:21,258
Like a typical Gujju guy, tall, fair!

332
00:29:22,498 --> 00:29:26,359
Silly, I'm not talking about Jignesh,
I'm talking about you!

333
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:28,177
What do you look like?

334
00:29:28,384 --> 00:29:29,174
Tell me.

335
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,987
Don't bluff because I can't see, okay?

336
00:29:33,999 --> 00:29:38,836
People call me rough and tough.

337
00:29:40,537 --> 00:29:43,439
That means you're not very handsome.

338
00:29:45,638 --> 00:29:46,919
Okay, bye!

339
00:30:05,964 --> 00:30:07,566
Ahh! Ouch!

340
00:30:08,482 --> 00:30:09,684
Aww!

341
00:30:12,303 --> 00:30:14,965
Don't move! Are you alright?

342
00:30:19,428 --> 00:30:20,222
Oh no.

343
00:30:32,423 --> 00:30:34,520
How many days since we became friends?

344
00:30:35,903 --> 00:30:40,103
Since Bindiya apologized to
the time Jignesh goes to Singapore.

345
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,205
That means, 6 days.

346
00:30:43,528 --> 00:30:46,585
And you haven't even told
me your name in these 6 days!

347
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,521
Suraj.

348
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,258
Suraj...

349
00:30:58,906 --> 00:30:59,828
Suraj!

350
00:31:00,905 --> 00:31:02,147
Suraj... what?

351
00:31:02,415 --> 00:31:03,906
Suraj Singh Rathore?

352
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:06,146
Suraj Uday Pratap Chauhan!

353
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:08,585
What is your full name?

354
00:31:12,152 --> 00:31:14,214
The one who gave me a name,
only gave me this much.

355
00:31:15,148 --> 00:31:17,266
I have never wanted
to have more than that...

356
00:31:18,435 --> 00:31:20,685
nor was it in my destiny
to have more than that.

357
00:31:21,185 --> 00:31:21,985
Wow!

358
00:31:22,724 --> 00:31:25,473
You should be writing the
dialogues of a show like Bindiya.

359
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:28,149
You narrated your whole
life's history in just one line!

360
00:31:29,342 --> 00:31:32,790
But, don't worry. I don't
know about your life until now...

361
00:31:33,023 --> 00:31:35,691
but from now onwards,
Jenny will never let you...

362
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,231
miss Rathore or Chauhan.

363
00:31:38,808 --> 00:31:41,097
If I have made a friend,
I will be a friend until the end.

364
00:32:01,107 --> 00:32:02,114
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

365
00:32:04,287 --> 00:32:05,678
I cannot walk anymore.

366
00:32:06,471 --> 00:32:07,743
Let me sit down for a while.

367
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:13,435
There is a bench over there.
You can rest there for some time.

368
00:32:16,275 --> 00:32:16,916
Careful!

369
00:32:17,527 --> 00:32:19,276
- Careful!
- Thanks.

370
00:32:25,637 --> 00:32:26,355
Listen!

371
00:32:27,477 --> 00:32:29,717
If you want you can go home.

372
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:34,557
I mean, if there is someone
waiting for you at home.

373
00:32:35,445 --> 00:32:37,838
- If you want, I can...
- What can you do?

374
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:39,998
I mean, I can...

375
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:43,838
You mean, you will carry me
on your shoulders and drop me home?

376
00:32:44,576 --> 00:32:45,239
Right!

377
00:32:47,224 --> 00:32:49,719
It's not a bad idea.
But, think about it.

378
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,905
You may regret it midway!

379
00:32:54,147 --> 00:32:55,337
Yes, I've thought about it.

380
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,255
Okay!

381
00:33:22,313 --> 00:33:23,945
- Okay.
- Okay.

382
00:33:41,371 --> 00:33:43,765
- Now?
- Have we passed the garage?

383
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:44,532
Yes.

384
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:46,094
Now, turn left from here.

385
00:33:47,544 --> 00:33:48,863
Just a little way more.

386
00:33:56,237 --> 00:33:57,431
Have we passed the mosque?

387
00:33:57,649 --> 00:33:58,489
Yes.

388
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,288
Yes, that's gone too.

389
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:02,010
Then, we've reached.

390
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,728
No, no. I mean almost reached.

391
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,368
See, there is a broken
down beauty parlor on the left.

392
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,227
Yes.

393
00:34:10,169 --> 00:34:12,490
There some stairs just ahead of it.

394
00:34:13,304 --> 00:34:14,097
Yes.

395
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:16,156
It's above those stairs.

396
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,050
Upstairs?

397
00:34:21,214 --> 00:34:23,386
If you're tired, I'll manage.

398
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:34,172
That's it.
Can you see that gate on the left?

399
00:34:34,332 --> 00:34:36,063
- Yes.
- We have to go inside there.

400
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:49,614
Not here! Just one floor above.

401
00:34:53,096 --> 00:34:54,441
What happened?
Are you tired?

402
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:56,967
You said, you were a tough guy!

403
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:04,762
Perfect! Just here.

404
00:35:05,782 --> 00:35:07,026
Ouch!

405
00:35:16,895 --> 00:35:17,867
I'll go.

406
00:35:19,778 --> 00:35:20,898
Just a minute.

407
00:35:22,298 --> 00:35:24,346
Can you just do me one last favor?

408
00:35:25,084 --> 00:35:25,978
Please.

409
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,615
There is a cloth stuck here.

410
00:35:35,692 --> 00:35:36,750
A cloth?

411
00:35:39,886 --> 00:35:41,148
It's an innerwear.

412
00:35:46,835 --> 00:35:47,695
Thanks!

413
00:36:02,185 --> 00:36:03,383
One minute!

414
00:36:13,814 --> 00:36:14,341
Here.

415
00:36:15,385 --> 00:36:17,015
Two tickets to the music concert.

416
00:36:17,304 --> 00:36:20,225
Consider it a gift
for dropping me here.

417
00:36:21,505 --> 00:36:23,696
I don't like music.

418
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,386
And there is no one
to go along with me.

419
00:36:28,748 --> 00:36:34,026
I could have gone with you,
but you don't like music, so.

420
00:36:35,211 --> 00:36:35,994
No!

421
00:36:37,826 --> 00:36:39,104
It's not like that.

422
00:36:41,467 --> 00:36:42,537
We can go.

423
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:44,502
I'll pick you up.

424
00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:30,357
Thank you.

425
00:38:11,793 --> 00:38:12,620
Hi!

426
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,994
Should we go?

427
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:32,322
""Playing the guitar with twist melody""

428
00:38:32,684 --> 00:38:35,607
""The youngster become impatient""

429
00:38:35,852 --> 00:38:38,361
""The quick and fast rhythm""

430
00:38:38,438 --> 00:38:39,362
The concert is there.

431
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:42,561
""Their hearts leap with joy""

432
00:38:42,638 --> 00:38:44,882
""Searching for partners""

433
00:38:45,646 --> 00:38:48,182
""What a beautiful rhythm""

434
00:38:48,258 --> 00:38:53,005
""All are welcome to dance""

435
00:38:54,234 --> 00:38:56,164
I have come to a concert
after a long time.

436
00:38:56,722 --> 00:38:57,804
Thank you, Suraj.

437
00:38:58,163 --> 00:39:00,301
There is an Indian
restaurant close by.

438
00:39:00,684 --> 00:39:02,844
I used to go there
with someone special.

439
00:39:04,005 --> 00:39:05,047
My first love!

440
00:39:06,005 --> 00:39:07,893
I don't know whether
it's still here.

441
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,228
Who was he?

442
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,208
Who?

443
00:39:30,027 --> 00:39:33,087
Your first love?

444
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:38,482
Silly!

445
00:39:38,814 --> 00:39:40,229
I was talking about my dad.

446
00:39:40,377 --> 00:39:43,142
This was his favorite place.
We came here very often.

447
00:39:48,466 --> 00:39:51,134
Enough about me.
Tell me about yourself.

448
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,811
Were you always like this?

449
00:39:53,271 --> 00:39:55,771
Haughty and speaking very little?

450
00:39:56,212 --> 00:39:57,598
The serious kind?

451
00:39:57,843 --> 00:40:00,451
Or did you have a humorous side?

452
00:40:09,214 --> 00:40:12,973
You know, Bindiya says,
that people who speak less...

453
00:40:13,415 --> 00:40:15,954
have a volcano of
memories in them.

454
00:40:16,609 --> 00:40:19,413
They keep on moving
around in those memories.

455
00:40:20,005 --> 00:40:21,768
Do you have anything like that?

456
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,415
You know, Bindiya also says...

457
00:40:26,636 --> 00:40:29,574
people who speak less
are either very nice...

458
00:40:29,735 --> 00:40:31,175
or very evil.

459
00:40:31,461 --> 00:40:34,605
They can die for somebody
or they can kill for them too.

460
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:39,325
And I have heard that blind people
talk more than necessary!

461
00:40:56,753 --> 00:40:59,989
We lost track of time
while talking.

462
00:41:04,077 --> 00:41:05,191
I need to leave.

463
00:41:26,893 --> 00:41:29,104
Suraj, now you are our only hope.

464
00:41:29,447 --> 00:41:32,703
Sikandar ditched us to
make more money.

465
00:41:33,287 --> 00:41:35,703
Now, forget everything
and come back to us.

466
00:41:35,891 --> 00:41:38,304
Because, if you're in the race,
we're in the race.

467
00:41:38,544 --> 00:41:40,253
These hands will never
be raised on anybody.

468
00:41:40,692 --> 00:41:42,233
I told you, didn't I?

469
00:41:43,871 --> 00:41:46,505
We're wasting our time with him.

470
00:41:48,145 --> 00:41:49,945
If he was one of my own...

471
00:41:50,886 --> 00:41:52,910
he would come at least once to
check on how I am.

472
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,653
He wouldn't have disappeared
for three years after destroying me.

473
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:03,122
This is not the man
whom I considered my son!

474
00:42:03,266 --> 00:42:04,105
I was in jail.

475
00:42:11,309 --> 00:42:14,663
I was in a jail in Kuala Lumpur
for 2 years and 7 months.

476
00:42:18,311 --> 00:42:21,606
Winning that fight 3 years ago
was not only your dream.

477
00:42:22,068 --> 00:42:22,986
It was mine too!

478
00:42:23,549 --> 00:42:25,233
The date of the fight
is fixed, Suraj.

479
00:42:26,497 --> 00:42:29,199
Just know that I am taking
the biggest risk of my life.

480
00:42:29,869 --> 00:42:31,270
You are confident, aren't you?

481
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:33,664
Oh come on, boss! If he wants...

482
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:36,830
he can break anybody's jaws and
put the teeth on a table before you.

483
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:37,870
Right, Suraj?

484
00:42:37,991 --> 00:42:41,750
Now that you have taken an advance,
then why be scared?

485
00:42:41,972 --> 00:42:43,032
Hey!

486
00:42:47,422 --> 00:42:50,527
The night before the fight
a woman came to me.

487
00:42:53,424 --> 00:42:54,712
My name is Natasha.

488
00:42:55,245 --> 00:42:57,216
And she asked me to lose the fight.

489
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,793
I have only one daughter, Alisha.

490
00:43:00,033 --> 00:43:03,234
She told me that my opponent
Ali's daughter had cancer.

491
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,148
And that if I won the fight...

492
00:43:06,271 --> 00:43:08,791
he would never be able to
get her medical treatment.

493
00:43:13,377 --> 00:43:15,123
Please save her.

494
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,572
Please.

495
00:43:37,237 --> 00:43:39,134
You have come to the wrong address.

496
00:43:55,038 --> 00:43:56,320
Come on, Suraj!

497
00:44:03,198 --> 00:44:04,462
Yeah!

498
00:44:04,882 --> 00:44:07,056
Suraj!

499
00:44:07,264 --> 00:44:09,095
Suraj!

500
00:44:09,282 --> 00:44:11,595
Suraj!

501
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:13,949
Suraj!

502
00:44:18,182 --> 00:44:19,224
Dad!

503
00:44:23,124 --> 00:44:26,725
Dad! Dad!

504
00:44:27,115 --> 00:44:28,120
Dad!

505
00:44:29,835 --> 00:44:32,035
- Come on, Suraj!
- What is he doing!?

506
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:35,950
Dad!

507
00:44:40,065 --> 00:44:41,366
Hit him more!

508
00:44:48,086 --> 00:44:49,237
Dad!

509
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,399
One!

510
00:44:58,254 --> 00:45:00,266
I had almost won that fight!

511
00:45:01,052 --> 00:45:03,968
But, when I saw that
little girl's innocent face

512
00:45:04,749 --> 00:45:06,489
I stopped fighting.

513
00:45:07,465 --> 00:45:11,652
I thought, I would have
other fights to win.

514
00:45:12,672 --> 00:45:16,625
But, that little girl had
only one life to live.

515
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,464
Suraj!

516
00:45:25,215 --> 00:45:27,633
Yay! Dad won!

517
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:37,414
For the first time,
I wasn't sad to lose.

518
00:45:38,282 --> 00:45:39,613
I had saved a life.

519
00:45:39,693 --> 00:45:42,162
Suraj! What was this, Suraj?

520
00:45:42,401 --> 00:45:43,933
Why are you asking him?

521
00:45:44,009 --> 00:45:47,136
He's lost and hiding out here.

522
00:45:47,442 --> 00:45:50,533
You led down the one who
mentored you!

523
00:45:50,655 --> 00:45:52,734
You wanted money, didn't you?

524
00:45:52,814 --> 00:45:55,535
You could have asked me!
I would have given you money.

525
00:45:55,667 --> 00:45:57,879
You have destroyed me!

526
00:46:14,053 --> 00:46:15,130
What are you doing here?

527
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,777
Hey, you!
Don't touch her.

528
00:46:19,052 --> 00:46:20,211
Who are you?

529
00:46:20,287 --> 00:46:22,066
Don't dare touch my kid...

530
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:25,200
You talk to me,
if you want her, okay?

531
00:46:25,743 --> 00:46:28,564
Then, I realized that all
this was a drama.

532
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,636
Everything inside me
died that day.

533
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:00,224
I decided, I would
become an evil man.

534
00:47:03,377 --> 00:47:06,257
So evil, that I forgot myself!

535
00:47:07,936 --> 00:47:10,371
After my fighting license
got cancelled...

536
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:13,473
I started fighting
outside the ring.

537
00:47:13,867 --> 00:47:15,839
I started doing extortion work.

538
00:47:18,465 --> 00:47:20,147
Hey what do you want?

539
00:47:24,327 --> 00:47:25,845
Why did you go to jail?

540
00:47:29,793 --> 00:47:31,666
It was the last night of the year.

541
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:35,079
Or maybe the first morning of
the new year.

542
00:47:37,153 --> 00:47:39,867
Everybody was welcoming
the new year.

543
00:47:40,124 --> 00:47:43,392
And I was just doing my work.

544
00:47:54,093 --> 00:47:57,071
Don't come close to me.

545
00:47:57,353 --> 00:47:58,709
I give you money.

546
00:47:59,414 --> 00:48:00,986
That's all I have.

547
00:48:01,424 --> 00:48:02,706
I have no more money.

548
00:48:05,033 --> 00:48:06,473
'Foreign language.'

549
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,605
'Foreign language.'

550
00:48:10,961 --> 00:48:12,806
'Foreign language.'

551
00:48:20,915 --> 00:48:22,076
Open the door!

552
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,200
Police!

553
00:48:25,146 --> 00:48:28,144
Open the door!
We have complaints against you.

554
00:48:28,388 --> 00:48:29,697
Open the door!

555
00:48:31,135 --> 00:48:32,300
Open the door!

556
00:48:35,452 --> 00:48:36,714
Open the door!

557
00:49:02,947 --> 00:49:05,058
I still look after him.

558
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:10,319
So that the wounds on my heart
heal with the wounds on his body.

559
00:49:10,937 --> 00:49:15,214
Suraj, the handicapped children
of my orphanage have made this.

560
00:49:15,712 --> 00:49:17,393
Do you have a girlfriend?

561
00:49:18,268 --> 00:49:19,691
Go give this to her.

562
00:49:20,122 --> 00:49:22,089
The love between you will double.

563
00:49:22,755 --> 00:49:23,712
God bless!

564
00:49:49,364 --> 00:49:52,848
- Celebrate tonight.
- Who is it?

565
00:49:53,914 --> 00:49:54,870
Who's there?

566
00:49:58,779 --> 00:50:00,326
It's me, Jenny darling!

567
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:02,968
Mr. Chang!
What are you doing here?

568
00:50:03,308 --> 00:50:05,364
I've been waiting for you.

569
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,610
- Let's go!
- Mr. Chang.

570
00:50:27,384 --> 00:50:30,887
I have got my own juice.

571
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:35,268
- Mr. Chang, please leave!
- You can forget about your juice.

572
00:50:38,227 --> 00:50:39,785
Let us have fun.

573
00:50:40,051 --> 00:50:43,415
I brought for our
special night tonight.

574
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:45,570
Please leave.
We'll talk in the office tomorrow.

575
00:50:45,648 --> 00:50:46,377
No!

576
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:52,173
Tonight, you listen to me!

577
00:50:53,731 --> 00:50:57,249
You must stay here
and drink this.

578
00:51:00,046 --> 00:51:00,858
No!

579
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,793
I'll see to it,
that we will party tonight.

580
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:13,838
Get out! Mr. Chang,
leave!

581
00:51:18,727 --> 00:51:21,044
How dare you insult me?

582
00:51:21,948 --> 00:51:24,484
You never cared about my feelings.

583
00:51:25,398 --> 00:51:30,467
I'll make sure,
you don't do this to me anymore.

584
00:51:31,142 --> 00:51:33,002
Just leave! Get out!

585
00:51:37,774 --> 00:51:38,976
Son of a...

586
00:51:39,374 --> 00:51:39,973
Get out!

587
00:51:40,049 --> 00:51:40,880
Suraj!

588
00:51:45,574 --> 00:51:46,413
Suraj, no!

589
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:49,285
No!

590
00:51:49,753 --> 00:51:50,697
No!

591
00:51:51,419 --> 00:51:53,658
- Stop it!
- This time I've broken your fingers.

592
00:51:53,795 --> 00:51:55,458
Next time, I'll break
your freaking neck!

593
00:51:55,594 --> 00:51:57,017
Suraj, please stop!

594
00:52:08,476 --> 00:52:10,100
Why did you do that, Suraj?

595
00:52:11,106 --> 00:52:12,478
He's my boss!

596
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,381
Tomorrow, he will tell
the entire management.

597
00:52:17,743 --> 00:52:19,409
I will lose my job!

598
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,212
Do you still want to work with him?

599
00:52:21,486 --> 00:52:22,772
Then what else should I do?

600
00:52:24,373 --> 00:52:26,178
Is there any place in the world...

601
00:52:26,406 --> 00:52:29,079
where a single girl
is not harassed?

602
00:52:30,626 --> 00:52:33,830
Is there any office where
bosses like him don't exist?

603
00:52:35,478 --> 00:52:37,082
Should I leave my job?

604
00:52:37,365 --> 00:52:39,165
Should I give up living my life?

605
00:52:39,354 --> 00:52:41,694
Who will take care
of my expenses?

606
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,766
- I will look after you.
- Why?

607
00:52:48,094 --> 00:52:49,917
Who are you to me?

608
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,315
Who am I to you?

609
00:53:02,128 --> 00:53:03,877
You cannot do anything, Suraj.

610
00:53:05,614 --> 00:53:07,665
Apart from increasing my troubles.

611
00:53:10,226 --> 00:53:11,540
Please, leave me alone.

612
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:19,525
Please! Leave me alone.

613
00:53:21,863 --> 00:53:27,928
""Why do I choose you every moment
among all the others?""

614
00:53:31,086 --> 00:53:37,317
""Why do I weave dreams
of you every moment?""

615
00:53:40,273 --> 00:53:45,471
""Why do I choose you every moment
among all the others?""

616
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:50,232
""Why do I weave dreams of
you every moment?""

617
00:53:50,411 --> 00:53:54,773
""You taught me the art of living""

618
00:53:55,029 --> 00:53:59,019
""Gave me the patience
to silently bear things""

619
00:53:59,346 --> 00:54:04,094
""You are the faith of life""

620
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:06,794
""You are my courage""

621
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:12,941
""You taught me the art of
living and dying""

622
00:54:13,193 --> 00:54:17,461
""My loyalty to you
has made me like you""

623
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:22,115
""You taught me the art of
living and dying""

624
00:54:22,366 --> 00:54:27,545
""My loyalty to you has
made me like you""

625
00:54:48,052 --> 00:54:56,298
""My loneliness is lost
in thoughts of you""

626
00:54:57,245 --> 00:55:04,918
""Now, my soul is
looking after you""

627
00:55:13,346 --> 00:55:21,800
""My loneliness is lost
in thoughts of you""

628
00:55:22,604 --> 00:55:31,303
""Now, my soul is looking
after you""

629
00:55:31,531 --> 00:55:38,896
""You are the faith of life
and you are my courage""

630
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:45,085
""You taught me the art of
living and dying""

631
00:55:45,356 --> 00:55:50,377
""My loyalty to you
has made me like you""

632
00:55:52,672 --> 00:56:01,488
""Why do I choose you every moment
among all the others?""

633
00:56:02,386 --> 00:56:10,000
""Why do I weave dreams
of you every moment?""

634
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:18,730
""You taught me the art of living""

635
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:26,107
""Gave me the patience
to silently bear things""

636
00:56:26,909 --> 00:56:33,868
""You are the faith of life""

637
00:56:34,612 --> 00:56:39,094
""You are my courage""

638
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,115
Hi!

639
00:56:52,164 --> 00:56:52,753
Hi!

640
00:56:55,032 --> 00:56:59,735
I thought about it
the whole day and left my job.

641
00:57:03,065 --> 00:57:03,748
Good!

642
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:08,434
Now, I'm not used to sitting at home.

643
00:57:08,762 --> 00:57:10,323
So, I thought I'd ask you...

644
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,511
will you take me out this weekend?

645
00:57:17,048 --> 00:57:19,396
You said,
you would look after me.

646
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,124
Always!

647
00:57:30,899 --> 00:57:34,538
The orphanage where
I grew up was here.

648
00:57:35,403 --> 00:57:37,304
And then one day, a storm came...

649
00:57:38,299 --> 00:57:40,477
and everything
got washed away.

650
00:57:41,145 --> 00:57:45,554
Now, whenever I'm lonely, or...

651
00:57:46,366 --> 00:57:50,086
I am sad,
then I come here.

652
00:57:54,977 --> 00:57:56,935
Are you lonely and sad
today as well?

653
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:01,330
No!

654
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,418
For the first time today...

655
00:58:06,662 --> 00:58:09,244
I have come to share
my happiness with this place.

656
00:58:23,105 --> 00:58:23,854
Found it?

657
00:58:24,074 --> 00:58:24,776
Umm-hmm.

658
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:30,217
Carefully!

659
00:58:31,289 --> 00:58:32,313
Perfect!

660
00:58:35,627 --> 00:58:37,889
Now, this is the foundation
of our home.

661
00:58:38,088 --> 00:58:39,196
Okay? Wait.

662
00:58:45,625 --> 00:58:48,868
These pebbles are the symbol
of the foundation.

663
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:54,252
Always keep them with you.

664
00:58:54,704 --> 00:58:56,673
They will always remind you of me.

665
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:59,848
And this, I will always keep with me.

666
00:59:02,769 --> 00:59:05,853
I will also come here to share
my happiness and sorrow.

667
00:59:10,379 --> 00:59:12,129
And you will find me here.

668
00:59:16,023 --> 00:59:18,430
But you didn't want to raise
your hand, right?

669
00:59:21,472 --> 00:59:22,669
Now let it go, my friend.

670
00:59:22,801 --> 00:59:24,733
You son is home,
give him your blessings.

671
00:59:25,072 --> 00:59:26,672
Stop asking useless questions!

672
00:59:27,153 --> 00:59:28,595
I want an answer.

673
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:32,498
He wants to settle down.

674
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:34,619
He has fallen in love.

675
00:59:44,097 --> 00:59:46,480
But explain to him
very clearly...

676
00:59:47,659 --> 00:59:51,161
his love should not come
in the way of my boxing.

677
01:00:11,658 --> 01:00:15,598
""Rise! Young lad""

678
01:00:18,082 --> 01:00:21,482
""Blood speaks!""

679
01:00:25,552 --> 01:00:29,093
""Filled in each and every vein""

680
01:00:30,946 --> 01:00:35,887
""passion speaks""

681
01:00:47,773 --> 01:00:52,441
""Rise, young lad. The blood speaks,
the passion in your veins speaks""

682
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:57,383
""Comes let's make up an iron mind,
and say the word""

683
01:00:57,525 --> 01:00:59,942
""Let's fill the cage
with passion of winning...""

684
01:01:00,019 --> 01:01:02,160
""Let's love the pain""

685
01:01:02,364 --> 01:01:06,990
""Become crazy, take courage to a high
and make all our difficulties easy""

686
01:01:07,124 --> 01:01:12,005
""Stay awake the whole night, dream
with open eyes - this is my curse""

687
01:01:12,086 --> 01:01:16,700
""Make all our difficulties disappear""

688
01:01:16,874 --> 01:01:22,783
""The sweat of blood,
my chest swells with my courage""

689
01:01:24,454 --> 01:01:27,082
This is our new home.

690
01:01:28,828 --> 01:01:32,251
There is a sweet little
balcony over here.

691
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:33,535
From here...

692
01:01:33,612 --> 01:01:35,877
From where the sunshine
comes straight inside.

693
01:01:36,021 --> 01:01:37,110
How do you know?

694
01:01:42,382 --> 01:01:45,955
I have always seen the sun
without my eyes.

695
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:48,767
But, the sun has never
looked into my eyes.

696
01:01:49,948 --> 01:01:51,603
Look into my eyes, Suraj.

697
01:01:53,491 --> 01:01:54,669
You are looking into them, right?

698
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:56,545
Yes.

699
01:01:57,683 --> 01:01:58,582
Lies!

700
01:02:01,532 --> 01:02:03,778
I can see everything
even without sight.

701
01:02:04,469 --> 01:02:08,253
And even though
you have eyes...

702
01:02:24,457 --> 01:02:26,334
'Foreign language.'

703
01:02:26,626 --> 01:02:28,447
The one who will look
after me has arrived.

704
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:30,945
Now, I can come
every day to help you.

705
01:02:34,307 --> 01:02:39,046
""Rise, young lad. The blood speaks,
the passion in your veins speaks""

706
01:02:39,176 --> 01:02:43,862
""Let's die and let's
say the word""

707
01:02:44,043 --> 01:02:48,649
""Like a heart of iron,
a gypsy who loves pain""

708
01:02:48,781 --> 01:02:53,496
""Become crazy, take courage to a high
and make all our difficulties easy""

709
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:58,379
""Stay awake the whole night, dream
with open eyes, this is my curse""

710
01:02:58,569 --> 01:03:02,624
""Let's break together and make
all our difficulties disappear""

711
01:03:03,369 --> 01:03:07,739
""The sweat of blood, my chest swells
with my courage""

712
01:03:07,892 --> 01:03:12,980
""Let's break together and make
all our difficulties disappear""

713
01:03:13,121 --> 01:03:16,912
""The sweat of blood, my chest swells
with my courage""

714
01:03:17,052 --> 01:03:18,191
Tell me more.

715
01:03:18,576 --> 01:03:19,426
Suraj!

716
01:03:30,138 --> 01:03:31,362
Okay, Stop! Suraj, no!

717
01:03:31,877 --> 01:03:33,583
Okay. Time out! Time out!

718
01:03:33,704 --> 01:03:36,799
Time out! Turn around!

719
01:03:42,259 --> 01:03:45,118
Looks like you didn't find any
patient in the hospital on Sunday.

720
01:03:45,481 --> 01:03:46,693
Just shut up!

721
01:03:47,246 --> 01:03:49,583
You boxers are
are as good as patients.

722
01:03:55,986 --> 01:03:57,781
You know, your back is really weird.

723
01:03:59,022 --> 01:04:00,750
The curve between
your lumbar spine...

724
01:04:01,221 --> 01:04:04,975
and the thoracic spine
is very little.

725
01:04:05,209 --> 01:04:06,897
So, there is a problem
even with my back!

726
01:04:07,072 --> 01:04:10,126
While massaging, you've begun to
imagine yourself as a doctor!

727
01:04:10,441 --> 01:04:12,147
- Doctor Jenny!
- Obviously!

728
01:04:12,278 --> 01:04:13,548
I'm a qualified nurse.

729
01:04:13,687 --> 01:04:16,433
They won't even let me enter
the hospital without this knowledge.

730
01:04:18,828 --> 01:04:20,908
If we collect some money...

731
01:04:21,677 --> 01:04:25,108
then I could open
a little school for you.

732
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,308
How sweet!

733
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:30,314
So that you can spend
some time with your art...

734
01:04:31,515 --> 01:04:32,924
and not just with your patients.

735
01:04:33,048 --> 01:04:35,287
Oh! And who will you
spend your time with?

736
01:04:35,602 --> 01:04:36,586
Let me think.

737
01:04:39,896 --> 01:04:40,822
What should I say?

738
01:04:41,429 --> 01:04:42,434
You'll think?

739
01:04:43,195 --> 01:04:44,279
Are you serious?

740
01:04:46,326 --> 01:04:47,073
No.

741
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:57,597
""The threads of a relationship between
us are beginning to take shape""

742
01:04:58,822 --> 01:05:07,250
""My uneasiness has now begun to
find some peacefulness""

743
01:05:14,662 --> 01:05:23,196
""The threads of a relationship between
us are beginning to take shape""

744
01:05:24,068 --> 01:05:32,729
""My uneasiness has now begun
to find some peacefulness""

745
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:40,598
""You are my faith in life,
you are my courage""

746
01:05:40,842 --> 01:05:46,774
""You taught me how
to live and die""

747
01:05:46,982 --> 01:05:51,225
""My faith has made me like you""

748
01:05:51,607 --> 01:05:55,999
""You taught me how to live and die""

749
01:05:56,211 --> 01:06:00,905
""My faith has made me like you""

750
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:06,595
Suraj!

751
01:06:07,439 --> 01:06:08,701
You have done this, right?

752
01:06:08,944 --> 01:06:10,841
How dare you?
Hold this.

753
01:06:21,235 --> 01:06:22,269
I'm sorry!

754
01:06:30,675 --> 01:06:31,984
Silly boy!

755
01:06:33,518 --> 01:06:36,661
We live in Malaysia.
But, we're still Indians.

756
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,317
Who is going to seek permission
from my parents?

757
01:06:52,631 --> 01:06:53,964
Ask them, silly.

758
01:07:08,453 --> 01:07:10,857
I don't speak too much.

759
01:07:11,678 --> 01:07:13,259
I will only say that...

760
01:07:17,874 --> 01:07:19,968
I will keep your
daughter very happy.

761
01:08:10,082 --> 01:08:13,098
You never told me
how they died.

762
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:15,703
What should I say?

763
01:08:16,607 --> 01:08:18,412
It was the first
night of the New Year.

764
01:08:21,533 --> 01:08:24,673
But for me, that night left behind
a lifetime of darkness.

765
01:08:30,289 --> 01:08:33,579
Dad had stopped all his urgent work
and was with us since two days.

766
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:51,830
And I was driving.

767
01:08:56,753 --> 01:08:59,845
And then that
fateful accident happened.

768
01:10:04,328 --> 01:10:07,693
But for me, that night left
behind a lifetime of darkness.

769
01:10:16,253 --> 01:10:18,387
My parents always wanted
the best for me.

770
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:22,913
They worry about me even
though they have gone so far away.

771
01:10:24,778 --> 01:10:27,246
That's why they found you
and sent you to me.

772
01:10:34,789 --> 01:10:36,511
Thanks for coming
in my life, Suraj.

773
01:11:25,549 --> 01:11:26,535
Jenny!

774
01:11:28,489 --> 01:11:30,000
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Jenny Mathias.

775
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,773
Oh! Okay. Ask the doctor.

776
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:33,304
Okay, thank you, sir.

777
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:35,202
Excuse me doctor,
I'm with Jenny Mathias.

778
01:11:35,318 --> 01:11:36,882
- Oh, Hi.
- Is she okay?

779
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:40,713
It was a little cut, not too much.

780
01:11:40,927 --> 01:11:44,282
She was lucky you know,
because the piece didn't dig in.

781
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:48,919
- Can I take her home?
- Sure!

782
01:11:49,024 --> 01:11:52,484
But remember, next time,
don't leave her alone. Alright?

783
01:11:53,453 --> 01:11:54,123
Okay?

784
01:11:54,221 --> 01:11:56,181
- Thank you, doctor.
- You're welcome.

785
01:11:57,548 --> 01:12:00,525
Oh! Why did you come?
I was about to come home.

786
01:12:00,682 --> 01:12:02,834
It's nothing!
It's just a cut.

787
01:12:21,985 --> 01:12:24,725
It's cornea damage,
causing visual impairment.

788
01:12:25,459 --> 01:12:29,385
But, sight can be restored in
such cases with an operation.

789
01:12:29,949 --> 01:12:30,671
Really?

790
01:12:30,922 --> 01:12:31,528
Yes!

791
01:12:32,025 --> 01:12:34,573
But, you have already
delayed it too much.

792
01:12:34,926 --> 01:12:35,809
What do you mean?

793
01:12:36,653 --> 01:12:38,889
That means, 15 - 20 days.

794
01:12:39,482 --> 01:12:40,950
One month at the maximum.

795
01:12:41,337 --> 01:12:44,047
After that, even this operation
would be useless.

796
01:12:44,506 --> 01:12:46,450
If the operation is done
within a month, then...

797
01:12:46,526 --> 01:12:48,610
can the sight in her eyes
be restored?

798
01:12:48,747 --> 01:12:52,453
Yes, but we will have
to import the cornea from the US.

799
01:12:54,242 --> 01:12:55,246
What will the expenditure be?

800
01:13:07,301 --> 01:13:08,458
Come on, suraj.

801
01:13:09,547 --> 01:13:10,639
Suraj!

802
01:13:12,098 --> 01:13:12,934
Come on.

803
01:13:24,868 --> 01:13:26,588
Come on, breathe!
Breathe!

804
01:13:26,995 --> 01:13:28,735
Defend yourself,
get him on the jaw!

805
01:13:28,852 --> 01:13:30,098
Why don't you elbow him?

806
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:32,519
Come on! Don't hold back.

807
01:13:40,472 --> 01:13:41,805
Come on!

808
01:13:49,426 --> 01:13:50,670
Come on!

809
01:13:54,881 --> 01:13:55,833
Suraj!

810
01:14:08,522 --> 01:14:09,219
Yes.

811
01:14:09,714 --> 01:14:12,425
- Well done.
- Good job, my boy.

812
01:14:14,181 --> 01:14:16,379
Until Jenny gets her eyes back...

813
01:14:17,618 --> 01:14:19,739
I will keep thinking
about this, Omi.

814
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:22,128
I need a lot of money for that.

815
01:14:22,705 --> 01:14:25,159
Suraj, who doesn't need money?

816
01:14:26,013 --> 01:14:27,960
But, Srikant is not
in the right shape.

817
01:14:28,165 --> 01:14:30,303
Neither can he help you, nor can I.

818
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:32,518
But, you can't let that affect
you, friend.

819
01:14:36,303 --> 01:14:40,257
And you will never get
any money fighting for them.

820
01:14:40,784 --> 01:14:43,509
I saw you fighting, not bad.

821
01:14:43,848 --> 01:14:48,692
One should not be angry with a man
who sells his soul for money...

822
01:14:48,807 --> 01:14:50,159
one should pity him.

823
01:14:50,891 --> 01:14:52,912
I trained him for 2 years.

824
01:14:53,661 --> 01:14:56,276
But, he still left and joined
Gavin's club for money.

825
01:14:56,669 --> 01:14:57,945
Let's see how long
he stays there.

826
01:14:58,087 --> 01:15:01,616
I got what I didn't get in 2 years,
within 2 weeks.

827
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:05,875
When you are fed up of
fighting this small fights...

828
01:15:06,791 --> 01:15:08,760
and feel like fighting
with a real man...

829
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:11,427
then come to me.

830
01:15:12,679 --> 01:15:14,104
You will get money.

831
01:15:14,695 --> 01:15:17,169
And all your desires
will also be fulfilled.

832
01:15:27,253 --> 01:15:28,707
Think about it, there will be pain.

833
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:30,968
Jenny will be more hurt,
if she touches it.

834
01:15:33,239 --> 01:15:34,464
Your wish!

835
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:49,618
I was thinking about you.

836
01:15:53,763 --> 01:15:56,872
I've told you so many times not to
do all this work when I am not home.

837
01:15:59,529 --> 01:16:02,353
But, I can't get anything done
when you are around.

838
01:16:06,533 --> 01:16:07,954
Suraj! What happened?

839
01:16:09,163 --> 01:16:10,434
Are you alright, Suraj?

840
01:16:11,307 --> 01:16:12,140
What happened?

841
01:16:12,629 --> 01:16:13,403
Nothing.

842
01:16:14,534 --> 01:16:16,174
Oh! I'm absolutely fine.

843
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:17,421
100%.

844
01:16:21,815 --> 01:16:22,833
If I could see...

845
01:16:24,141 --> 01:16:26,145
would you still lie to me like this?

846
01:16:59,954 --> 01:17:01,521
I knew you would come.

847
01:17:02,671 --> 01:17:05,652
I didn't know
it would be that soon.

848
01:17:06,091 --> 01:17:06,681
Drink.

849
01:17:08,264 --> 01:17:09,923
I need money, Sikandar.

850
01:17:11,196 --> 01:17:13,671
It is need that takes
a man to his destination.

851
01:17:14,122 --> 01:17:15,579
Tell me, what is your need?

852
01:17:17,412 --> 01:17:18,254
300,000.

853
01:17:19,249 --> 01:17:21,683
That's all? If you work
at Gavin's club...

854
01:17:22,497 --> 01:17:25,047
then your needs will be
fulfilled in 3 or 4 months.

855
01:17:27,193 --> 01:17:29,359
Jenny doesn't have
that much time, Sikandar.

856
01:17:29,712 --> 01:17:31,803
I need that money in 15 days.

857
01:17:32,363 --> 01:17:35,383
Gavin never gives such a big advance
even to family!

858
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:42,025
Sit!

859
01:17:47,315 --> 01:17:49,756
Look, now the matter
is about love.

860
01:17:50,645 --> 01:17:52,918
So Sikandar
will have to do something.

861
01:17:54,496 --> 01:17:55,820
If you need a bigger rate...

862
01:17:56,846 --> 01:17:58,447
then you have to do a bigger job.

863
01:17:58,586 --> 01:17:59,461
I will do it.

864
01:18:00,407 --> 01:18:01,200
Cheers!

865
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:51,518
Why are you crying?

866
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:54,176
Okay dear, sorry!
I shouldn't have brought you here.

867
01:18:54,328 --> 01:18:56,089
I'm not crying because
of that, silly!

868
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:56,826
Then?

869
01:18:57,486 --> 01:19:00,832
I'm crying because you didn't bring
me to such a nice place before!

870
01:19:01,056 --> 01:19:03,594
Come on, let's do it again!
Single ticket, double fun! Come on!

871
01:19:05,528 --> 01:19:06,597
What happened?

872
01:19:10,191 --> 01:19:12,993
The fun would actually have doubled,
if only you were able to see.

873
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:15,288
You are my eyes!

874
01:19:16,811 --> 01:19:17,488
Come on.

875
01:19:19,158 --> 01:19:22,210
You knew that the operation
would have cured your sight.

876
01:19:25,254 --> 01:19:27,018
What's happened to you?
Come on!

877
01:19:27,507 --> 01:19:31,015
You knew that the cornea
could be imported from the US.

878
01:19:31,631 --> 01:19:33,896
Yes, I knew! But, I also knew...

879
01:19:33,973 --> 01:19:36,820
that it would be impossible to
collect so much money. Let's go.

880
01:19:37,703 --> 01:19:39,442
You could have told me at least.

881
01:19:40,672 --> 01:19:42,928
What's happened to you?
Why are you wasting so much time?

882
01:19:43,006 --> 01:19:45,039
The park will close. Come on!

883
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:47,060
The doctor has said that...

884
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:50,825
you have only 15 - 20 days.

885
01:19:52,203 --> 01:19:53,959
- Don't you want...
- No, I don't want.

886
01:19:58,988 --> 01:20:01,812
I don't want to see a world
where my mom and dad don't exist.

887
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,543
Wherever your parents are, they...

888
01:20:10,161 --> 01:20:11,303
will be very sad.

889
01:20:12,452 --> 01:20:16,304
Imagine, how happy they will be,
if you can see again.

890
01:20:17,239 --> 01:20:20,066
And don't you want to
see this silly guy's face?

891
01:20:24,970 --> 01:20:26,765
But where will we get
so much money from?

892
01:20:41,882 --> 01:20:42,684
Work!

893
01:20:44,827 --> 01:20:46,165
Can you take a life?

894
01:20:47,675 --> 01:20:48,422
Sorry!

895
01:20:49,558 --> 01:20:51,045
Can you give your life?

896
01:21:06,074 --> 01:21:08,572
There is freestyle in Langkawi.

897
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:10,272
Will you play?

898
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:12,060
That's why I'm here.

899
01:21:12,373 --> 01:21:15,546
But, you have to fight to lose.

900
01:21:18,352 --> 01:21:21,587
And there is no need to tell you
that it is completely illegal!

901
01:21:23,585 --> 01:21:26,604
If you get caught,
the entire responsibility is yours...

902
01:21:27,942 --> 01:21:29,427
and only yours.

903
01:21:51,516 --> 01:21:55,544
I am thinking,
that if I get my sight back...

904
01:21:56,005 --> 01:21:58,576
then we will go to that
lake first.

905
01:21:59,245 --> 01:22:01,510
Where I've laid the
foundation of our home.

906
01:22:02,566 --> 01:22:04,359
Then, I will look at Oscar.

907
01:22:04,605 --> 01:22:07,961
I will look at the sunset,
I will look at the water in the lake.

908
01:22:08,037 --> 01:22:08,867
And me?

909
01:22:10,161 --> 01:22:12,767
I would have already seen you, silly!

910
01:22:13,839 --> 01:22:15,685
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes.

911
01:22:17,978 --> 01:22:20,541
Suppose I don't turn out like you...

912
01:22:21,507 --> 01:22:22,311
How?

913
01:22:23,742 --> 01:22:26,274
- The way you think I am.
- How do I imagine you?

914
01:22:26,507 --> 01:22:30,519
I mean... you know... like...

915
01:22:31,421 --> 01:22:33,620
You mean, the silly
and ugly types?

916
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:36,904
- You'll be terribly disappointed!
- Really?

917
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:39,830
Because, neither am I ugly,
nor am I silly!

918
01:22:49,719 --> 01:22:51,302
'One more thing...'

919
01:22:51,966 --> 01:22:55,842
'if you don't want your
family to land in any trouble...'

920
01:22:58,164 --> 01:23:01,629
'then you have to destroy every
identification that you have.'

921
01:23:03,292 --> 01:23:07,491
'Even your family's life can be
endangered in such illegal fights.'

922
01:23:09,406 --> 01:23:12,725
'So destroy every identification
of yours before you leave.'

923
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,523
'So that nobody can trace you.'

924
01:23:19,365 --> 01:23:22,087
'You will get a new name and
passport within two days.'

925
01:23:52,769 --> 01:23:55,886
'You will never leave your
girlfriend for a new job?'

926
01:23:56,595 --> 01:23:57,512
'Promise?'

927
01:24:02,042 --> 01:24:03,788
You've gone out of your mind!

928
01:24:04,452 --> 01:24:06,572
Will you fight for that
ungrateful, Gavin?

929
01:24:06,846 --> 01:24:08,773
- Just this once!
- Oh, really?

930
01:24:09,557 --> 01:24:11,825
And what if you're finished
during that one time?

931
01:24:12,576 --> 01:24:14,855
Suraj, the fight
you're talking about...

932
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:16,990
has 6 out of 10 fighters dying.

933
01:24:17,538 --> 01:24:19,949
The rest are crippled for life.

934
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:22,946
Otherwise also, I'm not alive
in the real sense of the word!

935
01:24:23,924 --> 01:24:26,382
I cannot bring
back Jenny's parents.

936
01:24:27,006 --> 01:24:29,337
But, if I can bring back
her sight, perhaps...

937
01:24:29,945 --> 01:24:31,620
my guilt will be a little less.

938
01:24:32,058 --> 01:24:34,248
And about having
broken arms and legs...

939
01:24:35,285 --> 01:24:37,105
I am a cripple now, brother.

940
01:24:39,239 --> 01:24:41,301
Your love has finally
gotten in the way!

941
01:24:44,226 --> 01:24:46,119
Actually, love has saved me, Omi!

942
01:24:55,178 --> 01:24:57,008
Take care of yourself.

943
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:12,866
Can I say something, Suraj?

944
01:25:17,595 --> 01:25:19,641
When the bandage
on my eyes is opened...

945
01:25:21,271 --> 01:25:23,395
don't come in front
of me immediately.

946
01:25:29,755 --> 01:25:33,760
I don't want to suddenly come face to
face with the biggest joy in my life.

947
01:25:45,916 --> 01:25:47,313
And I also want...

948
01:25:48,704 --> 01:25:52,784
that you should be with me
when my sight is restored.

949
01:25:57,814 --> 01:25:59,531
Will you be there, Suraj?

950
01:26:00,806 --> 01:26:01,984
Promise me!

951
01:26:03,898 --> 01:26:05,746
What are you thinking? Promise!

952
01:26:47,790 --> 01:26:48,845
Sarfaraz Ahmed...

953
01:26:50,142 --> 01:26:51,352
your new name...

954
01:26:51,832 --> 01:26:53,750
Need another ID, the passport.

955
01:26:56,478 --> 01:26:58,585
Your new phone with new sim card.

956
01:27:00,332 --> 01:27:01,398
'Foreign language.'

957
01:27:34,013 --> 01:27:35,912
Cheating with me...

958
01:27:42,034 --> 01:27:44,038
Normally I don't like
to dirty my hands.

959
01:27:44,329 --> 01:27:45,712
But I know when I have to.

960
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:53,517
Now won't you say,
that's why you came.

961
01:27:53,870 --> 01:27:54,683
To die.

962
01:27:57,603 --> 01:27:59,094
I hope you remember that.

963
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,069
Take him away!
Get him ready for the fight.

964
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:52,646
7 minutes!

965
01:28:54,170 --> 01:28:57,008
You have 7 minutes to die.

966
01:28:59,413 --> 01:29:02,639
What to do? The rules of
the game are like this.

967
01:29:04,336 --> 01:29:07,457
This fight does not stop until
either man's breath's stops.

968
01:29:08,371 --> 01:29:11,027
And your breath is
mortgaged with me.

969
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:14,626
From now on each breath of
yours will dance to my tunes.

970
01:29:16,152 --> 01:29:17,355
7 minutes!

971
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:20,568
You will make this game
interesting for 7 minutes.

972
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:23,117
And then you can
prepare to lose.

973
01:29:25,373 --> 01:29:27,520
That means, get ready to die!

974
01:29:29,454 --> 01:29:33,031
But you are a very lucky man, Suraj.

975
01:29:34,597 --> 01:29:37,313
Because, your fight
is not with an enemy.

976
01:29:37,621 --> 01:29:39,489
But, with your best friend.

977
01:29:40,364 --> 01:29:41,733
So cheer up, come on!

978
01:29:49,804 --> 01:29:50,973
Soup for you.

979
01:29:53,616 --> 01:29:54,838
Did Suraj call?

980
01:29:55,779 --> 01:29:56,403
No.

981
01:29:57,697 --> 01:30:00,488
Nurse, please check again.
He must have surely called!

982
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:51,297
Hit me.

983
01:30:52,232 --> 01:30:53,699
Come on, hit me man.

984
01:33:06,257 --> 01:33:09,438
'For 7 minutes you will
make this game interesting.'

985
01:33:09,666 --> 01:33:11,504
'And then you can prepare to lose.'

986
01:33:14,867 --> 01:33:16,225
'Get ready to die!'

987
01:33:30,801 --> 01:33:32,753
What an amazing girl she must be...

988
01:33:32,947 --> 01:33:35,400
if you're ready to
give your life for her.

989
01:33:36,081 --> 01:33:41,456
Your sacrifice and
her youth won't go in vain.

990
01:33:43,269 --> 01:33:45,330
I will take care of her.

991
01:33:45,794 --> 01:33:46,556
Yes!

992
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:53,434
Yes!

993
01:35:01,418 --> 01:35:02,196
Wait!

994
01:35:07,659 --> 01:35:09,561
He came here to die anyway.

995
01:35:09,899 --> 01:35:12,549
But, our loss will not be fulfilled...

996
01:35:12,951 --> 01:35:14,950
by his death his life will do it.

997
01:35:21,383 --> 01:35:24,663
And this time you better do it right!

998
01:35:33,445 --> 01:35:36,292
'I give you one more
chance to live your life.'

999
01:35:37,682 --> 01:35:40,844
'And if my goods do not reach intact.'

1000
01:35:42,057 --> 01:35:44,730
'Be ready to lose
your life this time.'

1001
01:37:53,071 --> 01:37:54,782
- Suraj?
- No!

1002
01:38:02,126 --> 01:38:03,158
Take care.

1003
01:40:01,135 --> 01:40:06,368
""Nobody knows why God
kept these eyes apart""

1004
01:40:07,431 --> 01:40:12,608
""Nobody knows why God
kept these eyes apart""

1005
01:40:14,192 --> 01:40:20,168
""My eyes are brimming
over crying and dying for you""

1006
01:40:20,583 --> 01:40:26,791
""My eyes are brimming
over crying and dying for you""

1007
01:40:27,010 --> 01:40:31,842
""They have forgotten
the ways of life""

1008
01:40:32,583 --> 01:40:37,538
""Nobody knows why God
kept these eyes apart""

1009
01:40:38,979 --> 01:40:43,687
""Nobody knows why God
kept these eyes apart""

1010
01:40:58,579 --> 01:41:04,405
""I am all alone in
this crowded world""

1011
01:41:04,895 --> 01:41:10,655
""I have lost myself,
having lost you after finding you""

1012
01:41:11,166 --> 01:41:17,250
""I am all alone in
this crowded world""

1013
01:41:17,496 --> 01:41:23,089
""I have lost myself,
having lost you after finding you""

1014
01:41:23,594 --> 01:41:29,419
""These days are as
dark as kohl without you""

1015
01:41:29,933 --> 01:41:35,829
""Even the stars are
dim during the night""

1016
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,894
- I have reached.
- Sample?

1017
01:42:10,554 --> 01:42:11,393
It's safe.

1018
01:42:11,753 --> 01:42:12,735
Where should I come?

1019
01:42:14,444 --> 01:42:15,860
I have very little time.

1020
01:42:17,213 --> 01:42:20,028
You don't have to come now,
Suraj, you have to go.

1021
01:42:20,547 --> 01:42:23,173
Because,
you really have very little time.

1022
01:43:10,136 --> 01:43:11,830
Excuse me, Dr. Aakash?

1023
01:43:12,192 --> 01:43:12,823
Nurse!

1024
01:43:13,628 --> 01:43:14,275
Suraj?

1025
01:43:14,353 --> 01:43:15,789
He came for my eye surgery.

1026
01:43:16,354 --> 01:43:17,356
You must be remembering him.

1027
01:43:17,434 --> 01:43:19,270
Can we get something
for her from CCTV?

1028
01:43:19,394 --> 01:43:21,031
We have the CCTV footage.

1029
01:43:21,262 --> 01:43:22,964
But it's only for 3 days.

1030
01:43:23,042 --> 01:43:25,406
I'm sure you'll be able
to organize it. Please, doctor.

1031
01:43:25,519 --> 01:43:27,001
- It's really important for me.
- I'm so sorry.

1032
01:43:34,985 --> 01:43:40,949
""My eyes have turned to stone,
looking at the roads and waiting""

1033
01:43:41,281 --> 01:43:47,112
""How did pain come
to the lips of happiness?""

1034
01:43:47,551 --> 01:43:53,715
""My eyes have turned to stone,
looking at the roads and waiting""

1035
01:43:53,934 --> 01:43:59,638
""How did pain come
to the lips of happiness?""

1036
01:44:00,039 --> 01:44:06,114
""My dreams sulk, our hearts
joined and then my heart has broken""

1037
01:44:06,322 --> 01:44:11,597
""Even the destiny lines
on my palms have broken!""

1038
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:17,168
""Nobody knows why God
kept these eyes apart""

1039
01:44:18,567 --> 01:44:23,539
""Nobody knows why God
kept these eyes apart""

1040
01:44:51,094 --> 01:44:52,603
Hi! May I help you?

1041
01:44:52,857 --> 01:44:54,190
Hi! I'm Kabir.

1042
01:44:54,818 --> 01:44:57,827
I have heard a lot about
you and your creative soldiers.

1043
01:44:58,472 --> 01:45:02,716
I have to admit your designs
are just as beautiful as you.

1044
01:45:03,401 --> 01:45:06,414
Thank you, but this work is
done by the children of the institute.

1045
01:45:06,751 --> 01:45:08,493
- Come inside.
- Someone's trying to be modest.

1046
01:45:08,710 --> 01:45:10,922
You are the one teaching these kids.

1047
01:45:11,414 --> 01:45:13,725
Anyway, I own a fitness club.

1048
01:45:14,170 --> 01:45:17,735
I need some gifts for my staff
for New Year's. Is it possible?

1049
01:45:17,813 --> 01:45:19,436
Yes! Absolutely!

1050
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:22,183
Do you just want to
go through the brochure?

1051
01:45:23,419 --> 01:45:26,060
When I see you so happy,
I am sure of one thing.

1052
01:45:26,323 --> 01:45:26,966
What?

1053
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:29,031
That you are not married!

1054
01:45:30,286 --> 01:45:31,023
Sorry!

1055
01:45:31,154 --> 01:45:33,449
But, I am married
and very happy.

1056
01:45:33,689 --> 01:45:35,044
Anyway, friends?

1057
01:45:35,718 --> 01:45:36,520
Friends!

1058
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:39,226
Excuse me.

1059
01:45:40,508 --> 01:45:41,127
Hello!

1060
01:45:42,477 --> 01:45:43,561
Yes, Dr. Kidwai.

1061
01:45:44,313 --> 01:45:46,904
No, I'm much better now.
Thank you, I'm fine.

1062
01:45:47,186 --> 01:45:48,387
Yes, it's been really long.

1063
01:45:48,547 --> 01:45:50,172
I'll see you this weekend for sure.

1064
01:45:50,699 --> 01:45:51,661
- Hello Jenny!
- Hi!

1065
01:45:51,737 --> 01:45:54,014
- I haven't seen you for long.
- Been busy.

1066
01:45:56,407 --> 01:45:58,415
Dadu... how are you?

1067
01:45:59,106 --> 01:46:00,527
'Foreign language.'

1068
01:46:00,877 --> 01:46:01,363
Yeah.

1069
01:46:01,441 --> 01:46:04,157
My ankle pain still not recovered...

1070
01:46:04,235 --> 01:46:05,442
Okay, let me check.

1071
01:46:07,114 --> 01:46:09,438
Paining? Don't worry,
I'm here now.

1072
01:46:09,514 --> 01:46:11,286
I'll be coming every weekend.
Okay?

1073
01:46:11,446 --> 01:46:12,853
- Thank you.
- Don't worry.

1074
01:46:14,054 --> 01:46:15,033
And who's here?

1075
01:46:19,637 --> 01:46:20,647
Hello!

1076
01:46:21,513 --> 01:46:23,172
You're Indian, Pakistani or Malay?

1077
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:26,511
Indian!

1078
01:46:27,110 --> 01:46:27,853
Okay!

1079
01:46:28,257 --> 01:46:29,932
Hi! I'm Jenny.

1080
01:46:32,932 --> 01:46:34,242
Won't you say something?

1081
01:46:35,492 --> 01:46:37,282
He has not spoken...

1082
01:46:37,580 --> 01:46:39,136
one word until now.

1083
01:46:39,291 --> 01:46:41,672
Okay! Let's see your case.

1084
01:46:47,655 --> 01:46:48,888
Muscle Spasm.

1085
01:46:50,890 --> 01:46:52,411
The recommended treatment...

1086
01:46:52,617 --> 01:46:55,660
for your case is a massage.
Let me check.

1087
01:47:03,402 --> 01:47:05,371
Your leg muscles are pretty weak.

1088
01:47:05,677 --> 01:47:08,283
It looks like you've been
in a very big accident.

1089
01:47:08,650 --> 01:47:10,758
Let me see, if you need
traction for your back.

1090
01:47:17,525 --> 01:47:18,542
May, I turn you?

1091
01:47:23,183 --> 01:47:24,236
Easy. Easy.

1092
01:47:26,171 --> 01:47:27,000
Okay.

1093
01:47:31,971 --> 01:47:34,392
Your back muscles
have deteriorated!

1094
01:47:46,505 --> 01:47:48,282
Sarfaraz Ahmad.

1095
01:47:58,355 --> 01:48:00,780
But don't worry,
you'll be fine.

1096
01:48:01,373 --> 01:48:03,924
You'll be back running around,
like you were earlier.

1097
01:48:05,168 --> 01:48:07,546
Actually you know,
I am not a doctor.

1098
01:48:08,029 --> 01:48:09,973
But, I have learnt
physiotherapy.

1099
01:48:10,937 --> 01:48:12,503
If destiny had been with me...

1100
01:48:13,234 --> 01:48:15,808
I would have had a physiotherapy
centre of my own.

1101
01:48:17,246 --> 01:48:20,604
Anyways, I'll be coming
every weekend.

1102
01:48:20,812 --> 01:48:22,708
And this is my card.

1103
01:48:23,232 --> 01:48:25,641
So call me,
if you need me earlier.

1104
01:48:26,052 --> 01:48:26,767
Take care.

1105
01:48:26,844 --> 01:48:28,499
Don't worry,
you'll be fine.

1106
01:48:40,122 --> 01:48:40,967
Bye!

1107
01:48:49,186 --> 01:48:57,853
""So much uncertainty""

1108
01:48:59,037 --> 01:49:07,619
""So much loneliness""

1109
01:49:12,957 --> 01:49:17,491
""Your stubbornness
twirls in my words""

1110
01:49:17,806 --> 01:49:22,192
""I have sunk in the perfume
of your breath""

1111
01:49:22,702 --> 01:49:27,140
""I have not been
released from love""

1112
01:49:27,614 --> 01:49:31,725
""I found the highs of heaven
in your shelter""

1113
01:49:32,064 --> 01:49:40,817
""You are the beauty of this world""

1114
01:49:41,630 --> 01:49:50,528
""You are the beauty of this world""

1115
01:50:05,252 --> 01:50:06,176
Thank you.

1116
01:50:06,441 --> 01:50:09,321
I will have your order delivered
to you by tomorrow. Okay.

1117
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:11,161
Great. Pleasure working with you.

1118
01:50:11,285 --> 01:50:12,304
With you as well.

1119
01:50:13,993 --> 01:50:15,848
Excuse me.
Can you do me a favor?

1120
01:50:15,988 --> 01:50:18,266
There are no favors
in friendship, just order.

1121
01:50:18,342 --> 01:50:20,720
I'm getting late. Will you just take
care of my shop for 5 minutes?

1122
01:50:20,797 --> 01:50:22,210
- Sure!
- I'll just go across and get some...

1123
01:50:22,286 --> 01:50:23,037
medicines for Romeo.

1124
01:50:23,113 --> 01:50:23,954
Romeo?

1125
01:50:24,599 --> 01:50:25,403
My turtle.

1126
01:50:27,026 --> 01:50:30,623
Romeo, Romeo! If only my parents
had given me such a lovely name.

1127
01:50:30,820 --> 01:50:33,363
- Then, you would have crawled, too!
- I'd do what you wanted me to.

1128
01:50:36,585 --> 01:50:37,690
How stupid!

1129
01:50:44,323 --> 01:50:45,764
Come on, Oscar.

1130
01:50:46,109 --> 01:50:48,007
Let's go baby, come.

1131
01:50:59,676 --> 01:51:01,026
May I help you?

1132
01:51:03,594 --> 01:51:05,415
Are you looking out for something?

1133
01:51:10,390 --> 01:51:12,845
Night Jasmine.
It only blooms at night.

1134
01:51:13,138 --> 01:51:15,398
It's available only at
our shop in this whole area.

1135
01:51:20,188 --> 01:51:21,124
Storm?

1136
01:51:23,605 --> 01:51:24,795
Should I pack it?

1137
01:51:29,424 --> 01:51:30,562
I'll just pack it for you.

1138
01:52:02,298 --> 01:52:05,215
Oscar, wait! Oscar!

1139
01:52:18,067 --> 01:52:18,950
Oscar!

1140
01:52:20,196 --> 01:52:21,312
What are you doing?

1141
01:52:21,577 --> 01:52:22,925
Behave yourself. I am sorry.

1142
01:52:23,002 --> 01:52:24,981
Really, sorry. He normally
doesn't behave like this.

1143
01:52:25,059 --> 01:52:27,237
I don't know what happened to
him! Oscar, come on!

1144
01:52:27,464 --> 01:52:28,495
May I help you?

1145
01:52:29,102 --> 01:52:29,687
Yeah!

1146
01:52:31,297 --> 01:52:32,333
Are you okay?

1147
01:52:42,190 --> 01:52:43,347
You are?

1148
01:52:44,737 --> 01:52:47,670
Aren't you the same man,
that patient from the hospital?

1149
01:52:50,499 --> 01:52:51,698
Should I drop you somewhere?

1150
01:52:52,228 --> 01:52:56,581
""You are my winters and
I am like the sun""

1151
01:52:57,129 --> 01:53:01,515
""I find peace in your arms""

1152
01:53:02,008 --> 01:53:06,467
""Love is like a musical instrument""

1153
01:53:06,914 --> 01:53:10,831
""I found bliss in your shelter""

1154
01:53:11,163 --> 01:53:15,558
""I found you, found you!""

1155
01:53:15,940 --> 01:53:20,035
""You are beauty of this world""

1156
01:53:20,845 --> 01:53:24,867
""I found you, found you!""

1157
01:53:25,708 --> 01:53:29,785
""You are beauty of this world""

1158
01:53:32,923 --> 01:53:34,011
Sit!

1159
01:53:34,758 --> 01:53:35,730
Sit!

1160
01:53:46,745 --> 01:53:48,244
You're back so soon.

1161
01:53:48,333 --> 01:53:51,162
Here, I have earned 50 ringgits
for you in 5 minutes.

1162
01:53:51,238 --> 01:53:52,653
Not bad. One second.

1163
01:54:00,085 --> 01:54:01,349
Where's Romeo?

1164
01:54:02,172 --> 01:54:05,369
Did somebody come here?
The man with the crutch?

1165
01:54:05,502 --> 01:54:06,494
Yes!

1166
01:54:07,159 --> 01:54:09,642
He was the one who
bought the night jasmine.

1167
01:54:09,806 --> 01:54:10,551
You know what?

1168
01:54:10,630 --> 01:54:13,187
I almost mistook him as
one of my favorite boxers.

1169
01:54:13,285 --> 01:54:13,977
Storm!

1170
01:54:14,535 --> 01:54:15,963
But I felt it was him.

1171
01:54:16,237 --> 01:54:18,431
But, he didn't react when
I called him by that name.

1172
01:54:18,597 --> 01:54:20,471
You know what?
I'm sure it was him.

1173
01:54:20,951 --> 01:54:23,752
I was looking at him,
but he didn't hear me at all.

1174
01:54:26,482 --> 01:54:27,508
Silly boy!

1175
01:54:43,421 --> 01:54:44,408
Suraj!

1176
01:54:56,707 --> 01:54:57,616
Suraj!

1177
01:55:23,014 --> 01:55:23,924
Suraj!

1178
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:25,833
Suraj!

1179
01:56:35,046 --> 01:56:36,063
Hello!

1180
01:56:36,646 --> 01:56:37,853
Dr. Kidwai.

1181
01:56:38,011 --> 01:56:39,325
Hi! This is Jenny.

1182
01:56:40,107 --> 01:56:43,089
Doctor, I need to know about
that patient on bed number 13.

1183
01:56:43,955 --> 01:56:45,480
Yes, Sarfaraz.

1184
01:56:46,883 --> 01:56:49,030
What happened?

00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,958
If you have visa and Advocate Sehni's
address than you wiII get work in EngIand

11
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,519
On that day my father changed

12
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,526
Now he onIy remember the caIIing
names of British men

13
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,327
Not our crying

14
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,160
What happen?

15
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,896
What happen to Sehni brother?

16
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:17,202
Lets go

17
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,041
Because of Advocate Sehni's death
there is a riot in South HaII

18
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:27,309
They kiIIed this oId man in a very
bad way

19
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,174
PeopIe caII them its a reIigious revenge

20
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:37,215
Asian peopIes are very angry because they
are thinking that inspite of proofs poIice is doing nothing

21
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,025
Everything was same

22
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,466
Babay said one thing that a Sikh
can never say

23
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,831
Father was fighting with them
with fuII power

24
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:32,035
In the beginning because for martydom uncIe
or may be because of our probIems

25
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:37,212
SIowIy sIowIy father was heIping others
in his fight

26
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,617
Because of anyone in South haII

27
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,689
Sometimes he gave speech and
sometimes he raised his hand

28
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,938
Those days were gone when we were
depending on Britishers

29
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:06,703
SIowIy sIowIy he made schooIs, dispensary
and praying pIaces

30
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:11,009
South haII became a smaII viIIage of Punjab

31
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:19,488
And my father was the Ieader
of South haII

32
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:23,693
And he had onIy one agenda and
one mission

33
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,671
Why I put down my head today?

34
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:39,544
Tomorrow they wiII put down their
heads infront of me

35
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,407
Everything was changed except
my father

36
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:51,555
Can these britishers make my bIood thin?

37
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:59,095
It wiII never happen.
My son wiII not pIay cricket for EngIand

38
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,940
Father gave his decision so
easiIy

39
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,702
He did what he wanted to do

40
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,871
I Iost myseIf there

41
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,912
Leave everyone.
I couId not see myseIf

42
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,099
And I'm onIy Iiving Iife as my father said

43
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,879
Give me your father's number

44
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,856
Do you want my sister's number?

45
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,669
My brother broke your window,
I come here to pay for it

46
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,719
I just toId him to dont pIay

47
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,257
What wiII happen if you say no?

48
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,554
Simran ChaggaI.
Dont waste my time

49
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,529
I cannot accept this card

50
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,734
Why?
Is it against your personaIity?

51
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:09,240
Because I have a good reputation
in South haII?

52
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:14,612
And if I become then wiII you
accept?

53
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:20,811
Because Rose Martin name is written
on in it

54
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,685
Its my mother's card.
She toId me I can use it

55
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,397
Its not Iike I cannot afford it.
I have Iots of my personaI cards too

56
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:50,345
I wiII not pay for window.
Return me my cards

57
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,678
When your boss wiII deduct your
money then you wiII know

58
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,196
He was my aImost fiance.
We were about to get married

59
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,734
Now there is no use to say sorry

60
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:27,685
You know what not everyone can get
this card, you have to earn 10000 points

61
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:44,928
My father aIso became a probIem
whiIe facing probIems

62
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:54,742
Jassi and his wife preety,
aII were Iiving Iife as father said

63
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,739
Nobody knew this

64
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,944
Everyone knew that its father's order

65
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,929
What poIice wiII do without press?

66
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,601
What happen?

67
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,139
Nothing.
You are Iooking very beautifuI

68
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,146
Father is going to fight with poIice

69
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,090
Your marriage is canceI

70
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,139
How you can do this?

71
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,351
We are fighting for your house

72
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,526
Dont bring pummy's in Iaws so
fast to home

73
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:21,362
What happen? Father tore construction of
AIi. He is coming with poIice

74
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,238
You again come to tease me

75
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,299
They aII are getting arrest infront
of my in Iaws

76
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,355
I had been cheif guest of
these peopIes

77
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,349
Ok say

78
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,726
I wiII see you

79
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,264
Dont stop me

80
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,588
Sorry I'm Iate.
Its ok

81
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,302
Why you need aII of it?

82
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,744
Again daiIy same drama.
Nothing is changed

83
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,439
They have changed it

84
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,345
His chiIdren was not getting admission in schooI

85
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,650
They have changed it

86
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,700
They aII are fooI

87
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,304
Are you ok?

88
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,143
Yes I'm fine

89
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,941
Take this your medicine

90
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,447
You become hyper for nothing

91
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,493
They are coming

92
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,635
Why you are wearing white?

93
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,745
Are we fooI because we were
crazy about matching coIors?

94
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:26,073
I'm pIanning since you were
not born

95
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,019
Ok I'm not going to invite you
on my wedding

96
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,117
Why are you crying?

97
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:40,858
You have to cry at Iast moments.
I toId you this before

98
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,851
Is everything ok?

99
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,288
They came here for charity

100
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,991
As they came to know that there is a
marriage in house, they come here

101
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:15,266
I show you my house

102
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:19,165
WiII Ranveer Iive here after marriage?

103
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,904
It takes a Iifetime to make house
in London Iike this

104
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:29,102
I was thinking...
You dont think much

105
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,872
Its our work to think

106
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:35,019
Bring them inside

107
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:39,715
Neither they are britishers nor enemy,
but father scoId them for nothing

108
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,319
Nobody knows

109
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:55,197
You have to pick up bobby from schooI

110
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:59,966
Let Gattu puII Iuggage

111
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:08,545
Monty has bring a speciaI news for
Radio 1 1 1

112
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:13,447
In Iast few series there is a bad performance
of EngIand cricket team, there is emergency meeting

113
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,792
They aII have to think something
different

114
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,186
Can you confirm aII team is going to change?

115
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:50,084
On that same night what happen
to that?

116
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:54,285
He out me in Iast 3 innings

117
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:03,495
You have to conveince your IocaI

118
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:06,799
Thats the probIem,

119
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:11,274
I dont have to conveince him
I have to conveince some other

120
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,467
DoIIy was saying it was your sister's marriage
then you shouId dance

121
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,238
Why dont you say anything
to father?

122
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:20,475
We did not make him grow up
for house son in Iaw

123
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,708
What can I do?

124
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:49,731
What do you think?
AII these sardars wiII do dance in church?

125
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:54,042
You have drank aIot

126
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,903
I can stiII see father's guys

127
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:58,004
I can stiII Iisten to them

128
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,658
You have drank aIot

129
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:51,527
Are you ok?

130
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,731
What did they caII you?

131
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,308
I did not recognize you

132
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:12,647
It was a Iong time.
I saw you in chiIdhood

133
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,879
I was waiting for you

134
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,965
Do you know who is that
boy with him?

135
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:32,299
He is a son of his friend

136
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:37,606
First she went to boIIywood then
she did dirty works

137
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:42,771
You couId aIso went to boIIywood

138
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:00,556
What you caII Simran here?

139
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:02,760
What is probIem in Simran?

140
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,002
Her mother is white

141
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:12,933
And her father was Sardar

142
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,110
I was saying truth

143
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,887
I was about to get engaged with you

144
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,485
My friends and me aIways discuus
who wiII marry you

145
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:30,793
Then we have decided that we
aII cannot marry you

146
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:36,590
It was very simpIe. Safeena was disquaIified
that time because she was under age

147
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:39,927
She aIways Iiked Jassi

148
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,606
Then who Ieft?

149
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,909
I said father wiII spit on white
daughter in Iaw

150
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,940
I wiII cIean it.
I won

151
00:30:57,722 --> 00:31:00,088
You never notice me?

152
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:05,222
If you noticed me than it wouId be
our wedding today

153
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,526
A combine marriage with Manmeet

154
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,941
Where is Gattu?

155
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,370
I Iive in that house since Iast
6 years

156
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,475
DaiIy I see you here

157
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,716
EngIand cricket team needs a fast bowIer

158
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,915
There wiII be a triots in 2 weeks

159
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:10,522
If you want then I wiII taIk to your father.
My father has opened a shop for me in South haII

160
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,228
I'm a shop keeper and I want to
remain a shop keeper

161
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:38,178
I have made Raajma (curry) and Rice for you.
May I re-heat it?

162
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:45,992
Today... Punit is mad.
He says fooIish things

163
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:49,265
He said sorry to father

164
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:15,054
Today I boy's baII came in my shop
and it broke a window

165
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:19,624
Say everything cIearIy

166
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:23,928
Dont try to hide your probIems

167
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:29,297
ChiIdrens can never hide anything
from their mothers

168
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:33,575
I dont say anything and my
mother understands my probIem

169
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:39,341
May be it was my Iife's siIence or upcoming
riot's sound

170
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,021
Puneet has reaIIy made a mistake

171
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:00,762
He shouId say this to you that
he toId to you

172
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,094
Why without any reason. No there is a reason.
AII because of my father he Ieft everything

173
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:13,434
Since Parter took our money and
run away

174
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:19,912
I'm so scared that one day he wiII become
Jassi into Gattu

175
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:25,354
A shadow of a man

176
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,584
I have to give food to Bobby

177
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,068
Someone wants to say sorry to you

178
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,809
Say sorry to uncIe

179
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,073
Did you see that?

180
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,351
You had a good experience to
how to deaI with chiIdrens?

181
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:00,322
I dont know how peopIe make
so many chiIdrens

182
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:11,661
I know how they produce chiIdrens.

183
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,296

184
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,945
I dont want baby sitter

185
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,919
If she is cute than teII me

186
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,346
AtIeast she shouId be 16 years oId

187
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,755
I dont want aunty type

188
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,387

189
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,226
I wiII do hang out with Gattu

190
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:48,065
I dont think you are a busy peopIe

191
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:55,271
I'm not interested to be a baby sitter

192
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,182
What are you doing?

193
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,550
Your one wish is fuIfiIIed

194
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:19,628
Lets go. Where?
To watch a match at community centre

195
00:37:20,034 --> 00:37:30,628
Coolbudy2007 - NaveeN @ -=DrC=-

196
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:35,309
I cannot see from here

197
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,778
I'm going to front side

198
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,285
Father is caIIing you

199
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:56,335
Its a good chance to meet boy and girI each other.
But why? I have done it

200
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:03,639
You make your wedding cIothes

201
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:22,794
Its a Manchester famiIy and
its a very good famiIy

202
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:38,171
One day he has to fix my marriage

203
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,240
Why are you going?
Why we cannot watch match?

204
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,774
If you dont want to watch then
dont watch

205
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:21,887
Again I'm saying. There is a seIection of EngIand team.
I strongIy feeI you have to join it

206
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,224
What is your opinion about today's game?

207
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,995
Why dont you ask them?

208
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:32,826
He is a IocaI hero of South haII

209
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,902
You teII them

210
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,920
Who is Partag Singah KaaIo?

211
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,691
You ask many questions?

212
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:08,705
Whenever India wins, we give to sweets
to whoIe South HaII

213
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:14,902
Its our beIief. No matter its a smaII match
or its a 1983 WorId Cup finaI

214
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:26,856
He is a son of LaIa Amarnath

215
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,085
Do bowIing Iike him

216
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:39,401
When LaIa Ji did bowIing,
aII batsman became confused

217
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:45,172
You drink bear

218
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,310
Why you send this appIication?

219
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,849
WiII father aIIow me to do this work?

220
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:03,454
Whatever was happenning with him,
that was aIso good

221
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:06,761
If Edward wiII not be in your marriage
then it wiII be ok

222
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:11,433
Nobody wiII do anything
Nobody wiII say anything

223
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:17,966
His own son....
What happen? Say

224
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:22,568
1 sorry is not enough for you?

225
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:31,349
Gattu you go from here

226
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:36,553
Why you aIIowed him to go?
I'm not scared of him

227
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:41,726
Who is he?
A reaI son of father

228
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:49,197
Because of him we are in this condition.
Everytime he says this become Iike Gattu

229
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:56,143
Live ordinary Iife.
Do ordinary work

230
00:41:56,614 --> 00:42:02,075
He is not capabIe to do anything.
He is just a bIoody puppet

231
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,588
And father thinks that we aIso
have a ordinary Iife Iike him

232
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:56,931
I can say onIy one thing.
You are fantastic

233
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,533
Your schooI aIso come.
SchooI starts at 8 AM

234
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:04,712
you have 2 hours Ieft

235
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,953
Someone was asking from outside
that why you Ieft?

236
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:19,091
Same question daiIy my wife ask from me

237
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:26,559
I dont know why this boy is asking this
question from me?

238
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,510
Stand up.
Do you have any probIem?

239
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:11,704
Ok I dont ask

240
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:22,357
I was asking why he Ieft?

241
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,194
It happens in this age

242
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,906
You aIso stay away from me

243
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:43,970
I did not do anything.
You wiII do it

244
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:47,015
You aIso stay away from me Iike him

245
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,234
So why did you quit?

246
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:14,744
Why did you take that decision?
Why did you quit cricket?

247
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,174
You are just a chiId, you won't
understand, I am 12.

248
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:21,042
And you were not so young when you
quit pIaying cricket.

249
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:25,080
If you couId decide it in that age then
I couId understand this decision.

250
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,017
Nor you can understand nor that Bedi.

251
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,927
You are saying no for engIand.

252
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:43,630
Mr. Bedi is asking you for seIection,

253
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:47,407
He is giving you second chance in your
Iife, How couId you say No Gattu?

254
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:50,371
Just Imagine now you can pIay
aII over the worId.

255
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:52,204
For fans and for crowd,

256
00:45:57,054 --> 00:46:00,046
Because my papa's heart wiII be broken
he wiII die.

257
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:12,897
You wiII pIay for EngIand,

258
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:16,697
You wiII pIay against India,
I can't pIay with India either.

259
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:19,574
India won't Iet me pIay.

260
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:23,146
I am a British Citizen,
Why don't you say British Pawn?

261
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:26,949
It's my mistake that you came here
and settIed down.

262
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:30,046
I pIay and I pIay weII.

263
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,184
What makes a difference that I pIay
for EngIand, what's a difference?

264
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:36,925
You're not so chiId that you have
forgotten what happened with Mr. Sahini.

265
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:40,359
I have put my bIood to raised you up.

266
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:43,355
If these white peopIe wants...

267
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,759
then they won't aIIow to breathe here.

268
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:48,268
And you are saying what makes
a difference?

269
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:50,530
You don't say anything,

270
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:53,003
If you wiII say anything then take
him aIong from here.

271
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:56,345
I wiII consider that I didn't got
marry you and son is so far away.

272
00:46:57,714 --> 00:46:59,545
Mom! you go outside.
Why?

273
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:02,845
Papa! I wanna taIk to you,
No need of that.

274
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:08,715
I said that you won't pIay.

275
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,790
If you wiII pIay then I wiII die.

276
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:13,520
Think about it.

277
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,292
Gattu! Simran! Fast!

278
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:53,036
If she is Iocked up in washroom then
why did you caII me,

279
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:55,269
Have you seen OM SHANTI OM?

280
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:58,465
In that movie Shahrukh didn't fuIfiII
his dream in one Iife so he born back

281
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:01,139
And you are getting chance again,

282
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:06,307
What?
You thought I won't teII her.

283
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,275
You won't get anything to staring me,

284
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:09,779
Better Iook at this.

285
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:13,314
You want to hide from papa then
Iook for it.

286
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,125
What's this?
Make-up, Wig.

287
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,659
We wiII totaIIy change you,

288
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:20,192
I mean Simran wiII change you,
Yes!

289
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:21,895
It's possibIe,
I can do it.

290
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,133
I can make you anything with make-up.

291
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,709
He is just a chiId,
He won't understand,

292
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:39,377
You are grown up,
You shouId understand.

293
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,575
ObviousIy! he is Iike her mom,

294
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:51,761
I mean sister.

295
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:53,958
I didn't meant his mom,

296
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:56,931
No! you said mom,

297
00:48:59,202 --> 00:48:59,691
Like others....

298
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:06,604
Go upstairs.

299
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:14,112
I was the paying guest of his mom,

300
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:16,948
He was 3 years oId.

301
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,115
When his dad Ieft them both.

302
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,486
After one year AaiIyah met someone
on internet in canada.

303
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:25,160
AaIiyah didn't toId him that she
have a son,

304
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,423
And she Ieft zee to me,

305
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:30,364
and toId me that she wiII come soon,

306
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,958
It's been nine years today.

307
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:36,868
And from nine years me and
zee are friends.

308
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,304
We are support for each other.

309
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:41,137
And we are saving each other to
drown up.

310
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:51,953
If you wiII see something is drowning,

311
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:54,322
then wiII you try to save him,

312
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:56,985
Ofcourse.

313
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:00,389
zee is doing the same,

314
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:02,931
He knows what doesn drowning means,

315
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:07,904
He even knows...

316
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:09,965
If one hand wiII take you...

317
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:11,871
then your Iife couId be safe,

318
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:21,215
You don't know how to swim,

319
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:29,323
You have aIready drowned for your
famiIy.

320
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:13,996
If you wiII pIay then I wiII die.

321
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,368
Like British are respnsibIe
for Veer Jee.

322
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,602
You wiII be responsibIe for my death.

323
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:26,593
Why did you teII them?

324
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:30,569
In this house nobody can Iive his ife.

325
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:34,210
Because you have aIways obeyed
your father.

326
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:37,670
You have sacrified your dreams
for papa.

327
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,350
Now they are not permitted to
watch dreams.

328
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:44,585
And if somebody wants to do
something,

329
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:47,348
then their mouth has been shut to
give them your exampIe.

330
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:51,817
Who is responsbiIe to save their Iives?

331
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:57,323
I couIdn't do anything for myseIf.

332
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:00,893
What wiII I do for aII of them?

333
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:20,249
You are getting another chance
to fuIfiII your dream,

334
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:21,549
And we....

335
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:24,324
We didn't get a singIe chance.

336
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:38,970
He wanted to become chef,
and he is frying JaIebi.

337
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,271
Aman is driving cab.

338
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:05,531
Gattu! if we want to get rid of this
Iife then we couIdn't...

339
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:07,160
but you...

340
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,364
who is reaIIy very taIented.

341
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:13,274
You are ready to Iive this Iife.

342
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:16,541
No! we are not ready.

343
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:19,343
Sorry! but now this decision is
not yours...

344
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,584
What do you mean?
You wiII pIay...

345
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,415
For yourseIf,
For aII of us.

346
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:28,223
How?

347
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,989
Papa wiII turn on the TV and he
won't find out.

348
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:36,695
He wiII read newspaper.
Radio or Phone.

349
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:39,625
He won't see my bowIing,

350
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:45,741
I can't pIay If I want.

351
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:00,816
Just show us to make your
dream come true.

352
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,084
Show us to win,

353
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:07,754
then Papa wiII reaIize...

354
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:10,858
then for that right he is fighting
he aIready got it.

355
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:21,470
Everything is changed.

356
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:24,873
Now onIy he have to change.

357
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:28,048
Then PatiaIa House

358
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:34,182
can ask his Iife proudIy back
to papa.

359
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:38,052
I can ask my Iife back,

360
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:54,675
We wiII handIe everything.

361
00:56:58,214 --> 00:57:00,205
Today first time I was something
for them,

362
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:02,784
Notjust something but more enough,

363
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:06,822
Because first time they saw a chance
to change their Iives.

364
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:09,114
What onIy I can give them,

365
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:30,779
PeopIe of PatiaIa House and they had
onIy one thing commom,

366
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:34,640
Anger against me,
their frustration,

367
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:39,088
Today they have become a famiIy
to beIieving in me,

368
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:54,228
Now nor I know what wiII happen next
nor them,

369
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:58,769
Then what shouId we do,
ShaII we Ieft everything on God.

370
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:17,193
Same door...
Same stairs.

371
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,990
But today I feeI that way is new.

372
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:24,863
and may be my destiny wiII be around,

373
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:32,206
You wiII wear this,
Why?

374
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,075
No! nothing,

375
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:37,577
Cricket don't need cIothes.

376
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:15,113
Do you remember?

377
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,986
Don't be nervous.
It wiII aII be okay.

378
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:28,360
Be confident I am here.

379
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,089
They were notjust taking the decision
of engIish team's future

380
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:37,919
nor my Iife.

381
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:41,392
but they were taking decision of
the destiny of PatiaIa House.

382
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:27,832
Why are you Iaughing?

383
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:35,940
Now wake me up!

384
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:39,617
I can't take this nightmare anymore.

385
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,486
You are Iike my mom,

386
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,626
If she won't be british then she
must be Punjabi.

387
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:55,102
And usuaIy reaction happens when
we don't have eggs in house.

388
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:58,531
ActuaIIy they are not finished.

389
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:00,938
But what it concerns with our pIan,

390
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:03,608
That's what I am teIIing you,

391
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:07,207
We have eggs,
We have pIan.

392
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:11,184
Don't panic.

393
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,682
We wiII handIe everything,

394
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:14,923
You go for training,
You aIready need some training.

395
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:21,327
Everyone wiII Iaugh,
40 years oId man.

396
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:25,024
Whatever!
But you need training,

397
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,188
You don't have pIan.

398
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:52,426
Why wouId I have pIan,
But you said it.

399
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,823
So what?
Why don't you have pIan?

400
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:00,332
Now who wiII convert Papa.

401
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,903
Papa wiII put his hand on Gattu's head

402
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:05,663
and he wiII say go my son and pIay
with EngIand.

403
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:09,872
Ofcourse he won't change aII we
have to hide it from him.

404
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:12,404
That's very easy.

405
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:14,806
TeII entire South HaII that hide
it from Papa.

406
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:17,317
Not entire South HaII just those peopIe

407
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:18,818
who reguIarIy meets Papa,

408
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:31,761
We have wedding in the house.

409
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:38,171
We have wedding in the house,
Everyone knew it.

410
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:40,466
Wedding means guests...

411
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:49,377
Papa can know anytime from anyone.

412
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,878
So shaII we stop this wedding?
ShaII we reduce guests?

413
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:57,758
TeII me the truth Did Ranbhir said
something,

414
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:01,086
I just decide it.

415
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:03,495
It was my idea.

416
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:07,529
I thought why do we need this wedding
with Iot of guests.

417
01:05:07,803 --> 01:05:10,704
Marriage is between two famiIies.

418
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:15,942
so why do we need 1500 guests.

419
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:36,755
When Gattu wiII win the man of the
series cup

420
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,468
then he wiII give it to us.

421
01:05:47,209 --> 01:05:48,904
Do you know I had a fiImi friend.

422
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:03,484
Everyone have a story in this famiIy.

423
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:06,160
They have some weakness,
We have to find out,

424
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:08,253
We aII are jobIess.

425
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:20,604
TiII today I thought we need taIent,
practise and hard work for cricket.

426
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:26,042
I forgot that team work is
most important,

427
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:28,983
But this team is pIaying to win,

428
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:35,689
Everyone was targetted in opposition
Nobody was saved,

429
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:38,726
Sooner they aII are getting exposed.

430
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:55,700
If gattu wiII pIay the cricket then
what's my benefit.

431
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:01,041
David Becham pIays footbaII but it
worths for his wife.

432
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:04,112
She is getting famous.

433
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:07,820
Think mom!
You wiII become posh!

434
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:15,555
And what about Aunt?

435
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:11,081
Keep Bau jee at home for
three weeks.

436
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:14,115
I wiII teII you how you just
foIIow me,

437
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,850
Bau Jee feeIs that you're a doctor,
I am a doctor.

438
01:08:28,804 --> 01:08:29,668
Don't worry.

439
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:31,930
But the bad thing is that...

440
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:36,902
Your bIood pressure is 1 70-99

441
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,814
I mean,

442
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:43,717
Your bIood pressure wiII be fine,

443
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:45,817
You just don't step out the house,

444
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:48,011
That's fine,

445
01:08:49,592 --> 01:08:52,356
I won't go anywhere and cricket
is aIready getting started.

446
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:55,563
No! no cricket.

447
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:51,081
Now what about Gattu!
We have to hide it from him

448
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:54,352
No! we have to hide him,

449
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:55,170
We aII wouId be on streets.

450
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,814
I had my whoIe money in
my waIIet.

451
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,189
I can understand why you are
doing it aII?

452
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:17,261
And may be you aII too.

453
01:12:17,566 --> 01:12:19,193
But which day Bau Jee wiII ask me,

454
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:21,201
then I wiII teII him the truth.

455
01:13:27,202 --> 01:13:28,260
Who is this KaaIi?

456
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:30,600
He is not from South haII.

457
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:34,072
I never seen him,

458
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:37,839
We don't know him,
Did I ask you?

459
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:44,546
Do you know who is this guy?

460
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:47,985
What makes a difference just sign the
cheque Gattu is waiting,

461
01:13:48,657 --> 01:13:50,090
You are very innocent,

462
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:53,091
This guy is ruining his
parent's respect.

463
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:54,522
and you are saying what makes
a difference,

464
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:05,170
You have never seen this guy before,
That guy...

465
01:14:07,509 --> 01:14:08,407
Pick up the phone,

466
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:12,212
I am Sehra speaking from DehIi,

467
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:15,540
I got a phone caII from BBC that our
Gattu is pIaying for EngIand,

468
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:18,446
I don't beIieve it,
How did Bau Jee agreed.

469
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:20,650
His phone is out of reach,
Give him the phone.

470
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:21,721
I want to congratuIate him,

471
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:26,989
It's Gur DayaI Sehra's phone,

472
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:30,628
He wants to congratuIate you,

473
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:32,695
Get me the phone,

474
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:05,189
CaII Doctor UncIe.

475
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:47,541
What are you doing?
Practise!

476
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:51,602
Are you practising or punishing
your seIf?

477
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:54,680
I can't Iie to Bau Jee.

478
01:16:00,522 --> 01:16:03,047
What I want?
I just want to pIay.

479
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:06,083
Then do the same,
You just pIay.

480
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:07,985
And Ieave the rest on us.

481
01:16:28,383 --> 01:16:30,476
She didn't say anything what I
aIready didn't know.

482
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:49,031
I have spent my every moment
to reach this stadium,

483
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:52,273
What eIse I knew?

484
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:54,803
It was my identity,

485
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,579
Rather I beIive in myseIf or not,

486
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:10,314
but others have faith in me

487
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:14,557
Why they are foIIowing us?

488
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:16,822
Nobody is watching match
in this house.

489
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,196
Because we have no cabIe in
this house,

490
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:24,064
You teII me did somebody forgot to
pay cabIe biII in cricket season.

491
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:26,206
You and him...
what's his name?

492
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:27,933
KaaIi!
Don't caII his name,

493
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:31,441
There is no difference both of you,
Both are trying to sabotage us,

494
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:34,515
ReaIIy? how?
You both are against India.

495
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:36,548
We shouId make his face bIack.

496
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:57,972
You can watch TV at my home,

497
01:18:00,575 --> 01:18:01,633
Turn on the TV.

498
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:37,571
Our cabIe is aIso got disconnected.

499
01:19:37,839 --> 01:19:39,136
Disconnected?
CabIe!

500
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:48,506
Everyone's cabIe is disconnected,
It's British controversy.

501
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:54,811
No TV is here,
What's happening in South HaII.

502
01:20:55,717 --> 01:20:58,117
Don't know why but cabIe is
not working,

503
01:20:59,921 --> 01:21:01,684
Perminder's CabIe contract
is canceIIed.

504
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:40,127
BIack face, bIack deeds.

505
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:43,559
Let's see what wiII he do?

506
01:23:43,385 --> 01:23:44,545
Puneet toId me that you are here,

507
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:52,752
It's my shop where eIse I wouId be,

508
01:23:55,964 --> 01:23:57,625
You go I wiII meet you Iater.

509
01:24:05,473 --> 01:24:06,997
Why did I need to do this aII.

510
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:10,634
I was Iiving my Iife,

511
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:17,112
So I couId bIame everyone that they
are responsibIe for my faiIure,

512
01:24:18,953 --> 01:24:19,510
Not me...

513
01:24:24,926 --> 01:24:27,292
Everyone made me stand on their
dream's cIiff.

514
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:29,328
and what have I done?

515
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:31,059
I make them faII.

516
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:33,095
But what so happened that you
can't get up again,

517
01:24:34,469 --> 01:24:36,994
You have more matches to prove
yourseIf. To prove what?

518
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:48,578
It was onIy first match,

519
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:55,322
Nothing is big deaI for you,

520
01:24:56,391 --> 01:24:59,485
You don't care if someone say anything
bad for you but I care...

521

If you were intended to kiII me

01:48:57,364 --> 01:49:00,993
No one dare to Iive his own Iife here.

623
01:49:02,335 --> 01:49:03,563
Who's Iife I've ruined?

624

You're right

631
01:49:56,256 --> 01:49:58,724
But my mistake is not that
I was pIaying cricket.

632
01:50:00,527 --> 01:50:03,052
But its the mistake that
I was about to quit the cricket.

697
02:08:39,878 --> 02:08:41,436
That I want to become actress and dancer

698
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:42,912
I'm so taIented.

699
02:08:45,951 --> 02:08:47,179
Father...
I want to get married.

700
02:08:49,021 --> 02:08:49,680
with him

701
02:08:51,623 --> 02:08:53,887
I want get married..

702
02:08:55,160 --> 02:08:56,218
You married..
No.. I mean yes.

703
02:08:57,796 --> 02:08:58,421
just yash chopra's marriage.

704
02:08:59,098 --> 02:08:59,621
15 functions.

705
02:09:00,199 --> 02:09:00,722
20 Iehanga's

706
02:09:01,266 --> 02:09:01,755
one song.

2
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,711
What is happen to this city?

3
00:00:15,967 --> 00:00:19,073
Ashes here, smoke there.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,004
Why are you so silent?

5
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:24,373
Why have smoke forced
down your throat?

6
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:26,078
Why tolerate?

7
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:27,441
Why banned?

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,610
Let's bring this
reckless act to an end.

9
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:33,436
Smoking is banned in
all public places.

10
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,274
And it is apply.

11
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,368
Don't smoke.

12
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:37,907
No let anyone do.

13
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:40,935
Smoking will cost you.

14
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:46,806
Your one seeks happiness.

15
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:51,706
But isn't has a very
high price to pay.

16
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:55,238
Smoking can cost
you your health.

17
00:00:56,833 --> 00:01:01,339
And can also seriously affect the
health and welfare of those who endure.

18
00:01:02,367 --> 00:01:06,406
Don't have them pay the
price for your smoking.

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,443
Smoking will cost you.

20
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,310
Ferdie has a candle
for every ailment.

21
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:01,646
He's the postmaster
of the village...

22
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:03,508
but no one here writes
or posts letters.

23
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:09,970
The man with the golden voice.

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,640
The only choir boy who refused
to stop singing in church...

25
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,577
even after he wasn't
a boy anymore.

26
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,542
Floating in a life inside his own
head, my best friend Ferdie...

27
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,835
who'll never have a
story to tell...

28
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,780
unless the story comes
looking for him

29
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:34,870
This is my home. This is
my village of Pocolim.

30
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:36,310
Hidden somewhere in Goa.

31
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:38,468
Don't try looking for it.

32
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:39,967
You won't find it.

33
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:45,943
Time passes in a
strange way here.

34
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,772
It stops when you stop...

35
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,403
and runs when you run.

36
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,210
Isn't that interesting?

37
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:59,345
I wonder what I wish
for everyday...

38
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:00,967
Maybe, wishing is a bad habit.

39
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:05,293
Like picking your nose and
wiping it under the table...

40
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:10,113
or eating too much spicy
Sorpotel in summer.

41
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:12,406
Yet, not a day passes
without a wish.

42
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:45,674
This is Rosalina,
my mother-in-law.

43
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:48,775
You know some peoples are just
want to take charge to everything.

44
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:52,742
Imagine a puppet-show,
as large as a village.

45
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,678
If Mai ever threw
away the strings...

46
00:06:57,233 --> 00:06:59,076
life in Pocoli would
just crumble to a halt.

47
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:06,971
Happy feast.

48
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,674
Call me Mrs. Eucharistica.

49
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:13,737
Mrs. Eucharis... - Forget it.

50
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:17,042
So you're Maria's...

51
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,313
The one Maria's
sis-in-law spoke about.

52
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:25,533
You call this a bio-data.

53
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:28,071
Why oh why?

54
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,676
Why means what, aunty. - What?

55
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:33,067
What?

56
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:34,810
You just said 'Why means what'.

57
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,437
No, I mean you said... I said...

58
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:39,053
That's the problem
with you youngsters.

59
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:40,803
You just can't speak properly.

60
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,411
How why means what?

61
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,100
Idiot. Come on.

62
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,974
Now say fast, what you want.

63
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,740
Aunty Maria said you'll fix
me up with a nice girl.

64
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:52,779
Fair complexion
and full of life.

65
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:02,337
Does your aunty think
I'm a magician?

66
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:05,769
I'll go to the gym.

67
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:09,439
So what are you waiting for?

68
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:11,241
Christmas?

69
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:14,076
Whether it's a leaf on a tree
or a dog on the street...

70
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:16,093
no one can move an inch,
without Mai's permission.

71
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,979
If you mess with Mai,
it's best to leave town.

72
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:28,578
Except, in Pocolim
nobody leaves.

73
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,938
Angie.

74
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:32,602
Yes, Mai.

75
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,071
Did Nereus drink
his milk properly?

76
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:44,478
Can't you land on your feet?

77
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:50,933
Mai.

78
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:53,407
Have you noticed Nereus
keeps falling asleep...

79
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:55,378
at the strangest of times?

80
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:58,312
What's so strange about it?

81
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,207
He sleeps when he feels sleepy.

82
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,374
You know it's called Narcolepsy.

83
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:04,467
Where you keep falling asleep.

84
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:06,735
You leave Nereus alone.

85
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:09,127
He knows better than you
how to behave like a cat.

86
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:11,604
Next you'll be telling me
how much I should sleep?

87
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:15,206
Rosie and I have just
one thing in common.

88
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:16,705
Loneliness.

89
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:20,009
I don't know when
Rosie's husband died.

90
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,807
She never speaks of it.
And I never ask.

91
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,738
As for me, I was married
to Rosie's son Gabo.

92
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,672
Very handsome.

93
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:32,308
Every girl wanted to marry him.

94
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:33,534
That's what he thought.

95
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,444
I don't know if I was
in love with him...

96
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,639
but he was already very
much in love with himself.

97
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,110
And anyway... no one
ever said no to Gabo.

98
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,340
Our wedding was the
talk of the town.

99
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,801
From food and drinks,
all the arrangements...

100
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,935
were simply the best.

101
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:51,042
Rosie did everything.

102
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,377
Gabo was so happy that day...

103
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:56,073
that he couldn't imagine
life getting any better.

104
00:09:58,067 --> 00:09:59,205
And for him, it didn't.

105
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:07,305
But life was looking
up for Rosie.

106
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,911
She now had an admirer.

107
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:11,913
A famous artist had
moved to Pocolim.

108
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:15,512
A magician with the paintbrush.

109
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,740
Every stroke of which...

110
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,244
earned him a standing
ovation from the art world.

111
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,008
They say that Don Pedro Cleto
Colaco has just one inspiration.

112
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:42,867
Women.

113
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:44,367
Big women.

114
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:56,173
I told you I'll set you up!

115
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:57,507
What are you doing here?

116
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,410
She's right here. Why
can't it be now?

117
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:00,973
She's busy.

118
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:03,010
You have to wait if you
want it done properly!

119
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,338
Wait for what?

120
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:05,837
The Second Coming?

121
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,044
You've been waiting
for 2000 years.

122
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,340
Any luck?

123
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:12,303
I can't talk right now.

124
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:13,633
Please leave.

125
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,937
Rumor has it, he's only
looking for only one thing...

126
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,275
his last inspiration.

127
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,675
And this... is Savio.

128
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:56,007
We were friends until
I broke his heart.

129
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:04,833
He just came back home...

130
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,073
after 6 years.

131
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:08,867
To no family.

132
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:10,077
Probably searching for some
imagined family treasure...

133
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:11,712
in this empty house, all alone.

134
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:22,976
He's a broken man.

135
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:25,268
And I did the breaking.

136
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:35,511
Savio, Gabo and I
grew up together.

137
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:38,810
Those two were inseparable...

138
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,600
but also fiercely competitive.

139
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,037
So when I told Savio that
I am marrying Gabo...

140
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,607
without saying a word,
he left Pocolim.

141
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,740
He returned after making
his fortune in Mumbai...

142
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,711
for his father's
memorial service.

143
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:02,878
There was no point
in coming earlier.

144
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,179
Rosalina had taken
care of everything.

145
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:08,237
Jesus Christ, what the...

146
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:10,367
Who is this?

147
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,576
You didn't recognize him?

148
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,667
It's your father.

149
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:16,273
But this was a
black-and-white photograph.

150
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,908
It was fully gone.

151
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:19,241
You couldn't even take
a good picture of him.

152
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:20,602
That's my fault too?

153
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,067
But why didn't you
use the original?

154
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:24,369
Look at him.

155
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:28,007
Are you talking about him?

156
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,771
Because he's dead.

157
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:29,342
Savio...

158
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:31,476
Savio, another word
from you and...

159
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:32,068
Hold on.

160
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:33,043
So this was also
my father's idea?

161
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,771
What did he say?

162
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:35,744
Paint my face pink.
Make me a clown.

163
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,108
This... this was Eddie's idea.

164
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:38,173
Who the hell is Eddie, Father?

165
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:39,541
Is he blind? Is he retarded?

166
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:42,580
Look, Savio... it's just a
little digital retouching.

167
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:43,667
BY Whom? A monkey?

168
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:45,840
Is Eddie a chimpanzee?

169
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:47,468
Is he a monkey?

170
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,300
No.

171
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:00,967
Ferdie.

172
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:06,803
Ferdie.

173
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:09,110
Ferdie.

174
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,879
I'm in the back side.

175
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,370
I think Savio Da Gama is back.

176
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,970
Return of the missing son.

177
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,738
Remember Savio?

178
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:43,237
What's this for?

179
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,246
This I'll light for my
broken heart Angie.

180
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:55,879
Hey, what happened?

181
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:00,607
Ferdie!

182
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:12,810
I knew it was you last night.

183
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:16,609
Continue like this, and...

184
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,547
everyone's going to think
that you're possessed.

185
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:21,733
Are you?

186
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,470
This is Assumption.

187
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:29,546
How can you even say that?

188
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:32,140
It's a mutton bill, Ferdie.

189
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:46,246
Stefanie Fernandes.

190
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,002
Fanny.

191
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,907
But why didn't you
post this letter?

192
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,539
I did.

193
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:58,235
It came back, last night.

194
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,880
After 46 years.

195
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:05,703
But you're in-charge
of the post...

196
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:07,269
so who gave it to you?

197
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:27,009
Ferdie, you proposed to her.
- Then what?

198
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:32,871
I asked her hand in marriage.

199
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:37,012
But she never replied because...

200
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,541
this letter was never
delivered to her.

201
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:42,739
You're damn angry...

202
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:46,210
46 years!

203
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:52,578
For 46 years I thought
she had rejected me.

204
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,945
What life is this?

205
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:00,969
Full lie I've lived.

206
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,871
Full lie I've lived, for something
that never even happened.

207
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:09,408
It's okay. - It's not okay.

208
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,643
Stefanie Fernandes was
and will always be...

209
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,145
the love of my life...

210
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:17,613
and she never even knew.

211
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,278
So why didn't you tell her?

212
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,040
I thought she'd say know.

213
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:26,877
But, if you don't ask...

214
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:28,674
how will you know what
her answer would be?

215
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,043
After waiting so long...

216
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:36,413
I wish I had kept waiting.

217
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,300
You've been crying?

218
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:11,705
None of your business.

219
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,540
This is Pocolim, Ferdie.

220
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,376
Out here, everyone's business
is everyone else's business.

221
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:25,467
Does it work?

222
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:27,833
None of your business.

223
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,077
It's funny.

224
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,271
How you can cry underwater?

225
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:47,178
Angie. Angie.

226
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,009
You're crying? - Yes, Mai.

227
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,245
But I think there's
a robber outside.

228
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:03,210
What are you doing?

229
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,879
Looking for the robber, Mai.

230
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,535
Are you mad or what?

231
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:08,753
You're making so much noise.

232
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:13,606
You'll scare him away.

233
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:18,168
Angie.

234
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,806
Go away.
- Who are you talking to?

235
00:22:19,867 --> 00:22:20,867
Go away.

236
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,333
The dogs.

237
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:24,410
These dogs. - They gone.

238
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,500
Come in.

239
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:26,204
They're gone.

240
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,712
I'll take care of their barking.

241
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,835
Mai...

242
00:22:35,533 --> 00:22:37,137
They always trouble my Nereus.

243
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,878
Go and sleep.
- Lock the door properly.

244
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:56,367
Ferdie.

245
00:22:57,267 --> 00:22:58,302
Ferdie.

246
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,369
What happened? - Is she gone?

247
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:03,633
Yeah.

248
00:23:03,767 --> 00:23:05,007
I had a dream.

249
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:06,267
What dream?

250
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:07,939
About Fanny.

251
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:09,133
Really?

252
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:10,867
And?

253
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,946
She was taking me to a church...

254
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,508
and she was saying
something to me.

255
00:23:18,867 --> 00:23:19,868
And?

256
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,504
Then I drowned me in the dream.

257
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:26,308
And then? - Then what?

258
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:28,871
What happened to Fanny?

259
00:23:29,133 --> 00:23:30,134
Oh she...

260
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,770
She was doing some...

261
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:41,510
Listen Ferdie, we
have to find Fanny.

262
00:23:42,133 --> 00:23:44,272
No, no, no, I drowned.

263
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:46,870
I'm telling you I drowned.

264
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:47,968
Look at me Ferdinand.

265
00:23:48,467 --> 00:23:49,467
Look at me.

266
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:54,007
Do you want to die
without telling Fanny...

267
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,603
that all your life,
you've loved only her?

268
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,109
No. - Then?

269
00:23:59,367 --> 00:24:00,607
I don't want to die.

270
00:24:02,267 --> 00:24:03,267
No, Ferdie.

271
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:09,772
No love story should be
left incomplete like this.

272
00:24:58,267 --> 00:24:59,267
Savio Da Gama.

273
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,401
He?'-

274
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:04,139
It's been 6 years, huh?

275
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:08,167
Looking good.

276
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:20,067
What's this?

277
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,803
My side-door neighbor brought
us some Tang, from Dubai.

278
00:25:23,134 --> 00:25:24,135
Side-door.

279
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:27,073
Six years Savvy, nobody
knows anything about you.

280
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:29,313
Whether you're alive, or dead...

281
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,700
or married?

282
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:35,540
You know Gabo died that day.

283
00:25:36,433 --> 00:25:38,743
Your train must have been
leaving from Goa at that time.

284
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,902
You didn't even attend his funeral.
Not even...

285
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,800
What was I supposed to
come back and do Angie?

286
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,601
Bring him back to life?

287
00:25:47,234 --> 00:25:48,736
No letter, not even
a phone call...

288
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,800
For what?

289
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,200
My friend died.

290
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,500
Felt like Shit.

291
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:55,207
By the time I found out...

292
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
he was already gone.

293
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:08,668
So...

294
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:10,967
did you get married?

295
00:26:19,034 --> 00:26:20,034
Looking good.

296
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,743
The car, looks nice.

297
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:27,505
Are you really selling it?

298
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,007
Do you want to buy it? - No.

299
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:33,613
It's for someone called 'SAL'.

300
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:40,867
So...

301
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,712
still pressing Rosie's feet?

302
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:46,778
Please, Savio, at
least I'm happy.

303
00:26:47,734 --> 00:26:49,008
Like always.

304
00:26:49,367 --> 00:26:50,903
So what's your problem?

305
00:26:51,633 --> 00:26:53,806
You know there's a world
outside Pocolim, right?

306
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,310
Life isn't easy here, but we
make the most of it, okay?

307
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,606
Really?

308
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,577
What do I know about problems?

309
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:05,042
Anyway-

310
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:08,409
I feel like I'm asking a
stranger for a favor.

311
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:10,203
What favor?

312
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:12,934
I need the car.

313
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:17,377
This is no longer my car.
- Then whose is it?

314
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:18,767
That artist.

315
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,708
That Pedro?

316
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:22,373
How did this happen?

317
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,743
Lots of money coming your way.

318
00:27:25,933 --> 00:27:27,071
Can't complain.

319
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,302
Stop pretending.

320
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:31,606
I've heard about your
big business in Mumbai.

321
00:27:31,933 --> 00:27:33,640
Well, yeah!

322
00:27:33,933 --> 00:27:35,207
Anyway, what do you
need the car for?

323
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,211
That stingy bugger won't
lend it to anyone.

324
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:41,613
You know that postmaster Ferdie?

325
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:43,412
He and I are going
on a short trip.

326
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:46,210
Running away with
the postmaster?

327
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,803
Yes... if the artist lends
me the car will you drive?

328
00:27:50,033 --> 00:27:52,707
He won't give it
unless you bribe him.

329
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,676
Rosie. Rosie.

330
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:43,872
Mrs. Eucharistica, Mr. Colaco.

331
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:45,002
Of course.

332
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:48,540
I want to make a
painting of you...

333
00:28:49,233 --> 00:28:51,679
for all the social
work that you do.

334
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,605
It will be shown in places
like Milan, New York, London.

335
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,076
I think it's a
wonderful idea, Mai.

336
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,335
No, no... I mean...

337
00:29:04,467 --> 00:29:05,912
But, come on you have to.

338
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,407
Yes but...
- You go to the church every day.

339
00:29:08,467 --> 00:29:09,605
Up and down. Up and down.

340
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,804
So much work you do.

341
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,340
You can at least do this much for yourself.
- It's God's work.

342
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:16,780
Can you see it, Madame Eucharistica?
- What?

343
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:20,814
Can you see yourself in
the painting, Madame?

344
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:29,378
Oh Rosie, it's my...
I mean, your future.

345
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:33,473
Can you see it please, now?

346
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:40,037
No. Not really.

347
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:02,045
I mean, sometimes I get a
little carried away, you see.

348
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:03,803
Don't worry.

349
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,105
Sometimes, Mai's also
in a different mood.

350
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:09,011
That's okay. But... - Nothing.

351
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:11,547
What you offered her was nice only.
- Yes, of course.

352
00:30:13,034 --> 00:30:15,412
You must be busy these days
with your foreign trips?

353
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:16,468
Busy?

354
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:19,576
I don't have the time
to breathe, darling.

355
00:30:19,633 --> 00:30:20,543
Oh...

356
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,580
Because we were
planning a road trip.

357
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,646
Who we? - Mai and me.

358
00:30:27,633 --> 00:30:29,635
I thought you'll get a
chance, you know...

359
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,940
to know her better.

360
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,677
But it's okay. Next time.

361
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:35,441
Time is what I don't have.

362
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:38,036
It's alright. - No, no, no, no.

363
00:30:39,067 --> 00:30:40,478
I'll adjust.

364
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,536
Everything happened
so fast that...

365
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:03,840
I'm sorry I didn't get a
chance to tell you earlier.

366
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:07,844
Anyway... I'll leave from Chapel
Point at 11 in the morning...

367
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,709
for a matter of
Christian charity.

368
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:13,841
I'm going to help Ferdie.

369
00:31:13,933 --> 00:31:16,573
He needs my help more than
anyone else in the world.

370
00:31:21,267 --> 00:31:23,804
Don Pedro has offered his
car for this journey and...

371
00:31:23,867 --> 00:31:25,938
of course, he's coming along.

372
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,936
Sweet of him, isn't it?

373
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,010
He couldn't stop going on about
how he wishes paint you.

374
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:33,113
All he keeps talking about is...

375
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:36,080
capturing your elegance
and beauty on canvas.

376
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:37,339
So flattering, isn't it?

377
00:31:39,067 --> 00:31:39,807
It started.

378
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,900
It started.

379
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:42,133
It started.

380
00:31:43,633 --> 00:31:46,614
I'll just have to be careful
of our driver, Savio.

381
00:31:47,234 --> 00:31:49,145
The way he looks at me
makes me uncomfortable.

382
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,607
But how will I stop him?

383
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,440
By looking at your photo.

384
00:31:53,534 --> 00:31:55,734
I will stop myself from getting
drawn into temptation...

385
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,641
You've always taught me to put
other's needs before ours.

386
00:32:02,233 --> 00:32:04,113
And now is the time to put
this into practice...

387
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:05,610
so the world will say
that Rosalina...

388
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:07,067
has taught her
daughter-in-law well!

389
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:26,767
What are you doing here?

390
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,837
There's a lady
coming on this trip.

391
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:31,877
You could've cleaned the car...

392
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,034
before bringing it here?

393
00:32:35,234 --> 00:32:36,941
I hope the seats are clean.

394
00:32:38,267 --> 00:32:41,248
Leather and sweat smell like
pigs' piss after a while.

395
00:32:41,734 --> 00:32:42,940
This is rexine, you idiot.

396
00:32:43,234 --> 00:32:44,304
You...

397
00:32:44,734 --> 00:32:45,769
What did you say?

398
00:32:46,867 --> 00:32:48,039
I said it's clean.

399
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
You...

400
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:52,846
She's here.

401
00:33:01,867 --> 00:33:03,642
The beautiful Angelina.

402
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,776
The glow on your cheeks
puts the sun to shame.

403
00:33:07,234 --> 00:33:09,271
And the Romeo of Romeos.

404
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:11,237
The Casanova of the Konkan.

405
00:33:13,967 --> 00:33:16,174
You're an inspiration to lovers.

406
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,173
I salute you, sire.

407
00:33:21,534 --> 00:33:24,538
And where's the
other lovely lady?

408
00:33:25,533 --> 00:33:26,739
She'll be coming, soon.

409
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,201
I'll be right back.

410
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:32,839
I'm here only.

411
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,605
Why are you holding my hand?

412
00:33:43,934 --> 00:33:46,141
Listen, before you
get furious...

413
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,476
let me tell you, this was
out of my control, okay.

414
00:33:48,634 --> 00:33:49,634
Lies.

415
00:33:50,167 --> 00:33:52,087
What did you expect me to say to him?
Don't come.

416
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:53,669
You tricked me into
driving this car.

417
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,178
What do you mean I tricked you?

418
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:56,542
This is his car, after all.

419
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,573
Listen, I just wanted to
get out this village.

420
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:02,607
Finally, I wanted to spend some time...
- I'm sorry.

421
00:34:02,767 --> 00:34:03,939
I had to help Ferdie.

422
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,570
So you lied.

423
00:34:11,234 --> 00:34:12,178
You know what, to hell with him.

424
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,600
And don't talk to me, just go.

425
00:34:16,267 --> 00:34:17,267
You know, Savio...

426
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,981
sometimes, you need to make
an effort to find love.

427
00:34:26,967 --> 00:34:28,037
Angie, this is why...

428
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,940
She's also coming along?!

429
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,646
Rosalina, the first
lady of Pocolim.

430
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,720
What a lovely day this is...

431
00:34:36,734 --> 00:34:38,534
that comes with the
privilege of your company.

432
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:40,935
My humble car awaits.

433
00:34:41,534 --> 00:34:42,740
Come. - Here.

434
00:34:44,033 --> 00:34:45,307
Why do you drop everything?

435
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:46,805
Are you butter fingers?

436
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:48,346
It moved.

437
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,011
Of course it moved, it's a cat.

438
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:53,333
Don...

439
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,304
Madame.

440
00:34:56,334 --> 00:34:58,712
What a lovely cat. Just
making a bit of noise.

441
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,902
Has it come to say
goodbye to us?

442
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,213
Will Nereus come along, Mai?

443
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,903
We need to discuss some
important things, young lady.

444
00:35:15,267 --> 00:35:16,268
Look here.

445
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:17,705
Come.

446
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:22,110
How will I face my Gabo...

447
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,806
if I can't even protect
his wife's purity?

448
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,943
Proud of you. - Thank you, Mai.

449
00:35:27,034 --> 00:35:29,674
And there's no one to
look after Nereus.

450
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,436
He'll be fine. He'll
stay with me.

451
00:35:32,634 --> 00:35:33,635
You take care of him.

452
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:38,333
You okay?

453
00:35:41,634 --> 00:35:43,375
What a lovely car, Don Pedro.

454
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,307
Yes, I thought so too when I
saw it for the first time.

455
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,240
Just needed a bit of repair.

456
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,335
Nothing much though.

457
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:54,239
Hey you, can you drive a
fine imported car like this?

458
00:35:55,034 --> 00:35:56,980
Hey, it's you I'm talking to.

459
00:35:57,367 --> 00:35:58,573
And good morning.

460
00:35:59,567 --> 00:36:01,647
Your mother must have forgotten
to teach you manners.

461
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:03,542
It's okay, I'll teach you.

462
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,938
You're asking me if I can drive?

463
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,509
I mean... are you qualified?

464
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,441
It's a foreign car after all.

465
00:36:12,433 --> 00:36:13,070
What?

466
00:36:13,134 --> 00:36:14,545
The gears are different.

467
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,670
Can anyone here drive this car?

468
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,642
Since you know a lot about foreign
cars and their bloody gears?

469
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:26,067
I can't...

470
00:36:29,234 --> 00:36:30,178
And since this is
Don Pedro's car...

471
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:32,907
and he doesn't know how
to drive, so who's left?

472
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,400
Huh, madam?

473
00:36:36,534 --> 00:36:38,445
I don't trust this
hooligan's driving.

474
00:36:56,734 --> 00:36:57,894
Everything should be alright.

475
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,071
<i>God mess.</i>

476
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:01,167
Okay Ferdinand...

477
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Thank you.

478
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,073
Ferdie, we really don't need
to make this small talk.

479
00:37:50,734 --> 00:37:51,734
Sorry.

480
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,120
There's something
strange on your face.

481
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:00,637
No... I mean.

482
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,838
Why are you speaking now?

483
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:10,944
Hey Ferdie, open the bottle.

484
00:38:11,734 --> 00:38:12,838
He couldn't even get water?

485
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:15,842
Couldn't even do this much?

486
00:38:19,534 --> 00:38:21,254
I keep doing work for
others all the time...

487
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,604
but no one cares.

488
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,772
I'm thirsty, one second.

489
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,337
Yuck! What is this?

490
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,900
What are you doing?

491
00:39:26,634 --> 00:39:27,634
What?

492
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,900
What am I doing?

493
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:30,434
What am I doing?

494
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:32,606
Yes, what are you doing?

495
00:39:34,534 --> 00:39:36,414
How much longer will I
have to wait, god dammit?

496
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:38,641
What are you saying?

497
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,304
So tell me, Ferdie, how come no Mrs.
Ferdie all these years?

498
00:39:57,434 --> 00:39:58,606
Oh...

499
00:40:00,934 --> 00:40:02,242
Just like that.

500
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:03,840
There was no one else...

501
00:40:05,567 --> 00:40:06,567
after Fanny.

502
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,411
She is for real, right?

503
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,704
Romeo without a Juliet.

504
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:19,767
Sorry.

505
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:23,771
I want to put this cat inside.

506
00:40:24,734 --> 00:40:25,734
Wipe your face.

507
00:40:52,234 --> 00:40:53,406
He looks alive, doesn't he?

508
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,401
What?

509
00:40:58,767 --> 00:41:00,647
Does anyone want to tell
Mai what just happened?

510
00:41:03,234 --> 00:41:04,234
Exactly.

511
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,543
So we'll stop somewhere on the
way and say a prayer for Nereus.

512
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:10,774
You mean, she'll
wake up and see...

513
00:41:10,867 --> 00:41:13,245
that Nereus passed
away in his sleep?

514
00:41:13,734 --> 00:41:14,735
Yeah.

515
00:41:48,934 --> 00:41:49,934
See... see.

516
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:51,674
Fanny's house.

517
00:41:53,734 --> 00:41:54,734
Happy?

518
00:41:55,134 --> 00:41:56,134
Come.

519
00:42:02,934 --> 00:42:04,414
This house is bigger
than your palace.

520
00:42:04,967 --> 00:42:05,967
Pretty, no?

521
00:42:06,167 --> 00:42:08,113
Pretty, like my Fanny.

522
00:42:10,234 --> 00:42:11,234
This is it, sir.

523
00:42:11,734 --> 00:42:12,906
It's your show from now.

524
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:14,703
Come on, you Romeo.

525
00:42:15,067 --> 00:42:16,637
No more thinking.

526
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,038
Make or break.

527
00:42:27,134 --> 00:42:28,134
Ferdie.

528
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:29,667
Hey...

529
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,500
Go get him.

530
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,472
Get him.

531
00:42:35,867 --> 00:42:36,867
Ferdie. Ferdie.

532
00:42:37,034 --> 00:42:38,035
Ferdie, wait up.

533
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:40,367
Ferdie.

534
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,579
Ferdie, wait. Wait.

535
00:42:44,433 --> 00:42:45,537
What if...

536
00:42:48,434 --> 00:42:50,141
What if she doesn't
recognize me?

537
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,501
Mad or what?

538
00:42:51,934 --> 00:42:53,641
Who would forget a
personality like yours?

539
00:42:54,834 --> 00:42:56,336
Yes, I haven't changed much.

540
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,509
I'm the same. - Yes.

541
00:42:58,767 --> 00:43:00,087
So there's nothing
to worry about.

542
00:43:04,067 --> 00:43:05,774
Yeah. Show her your
romantic side.

543
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,405
There are thorns everywhere.

544
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,906
Show. Show.

545
00:43:24,167 --> 00:43:25,737
Ferdie. Hold this.

546
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Stupid.

547
00:43:28,234 --> 00:43:29,674
You should've got
some other flowers.

548
00:43:30,134 --> 00:43:31,670
Why did you pluck roses?
- Savio said.

549
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,472
I look alright?

550
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,300
Excuse me, sir.

551
00:44:21,334 --> 00:44:23,109
We're looking for
Stefanie Fernandes.

552
00:44:23,367 --> 00:44:24,812
Of course, you are.

553
00:44:25,767 --> 00:44:27,474
She's waiting for you.

554
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,711
You must come in, please.

555
00:44:32,934 --> 00:44:34,345
Come, come.

556
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,475
Welcome to my home!

557
00:44:38,067 --> 00:44:40,479
She married a foreigner? - No.

558
00:44:40,534 --> 00:44:41,638
He's a bloody hippie.

559
00:44:41,867 --> 00:44:43,938
Russian. I'll handle it.

560
00:44:58,034 --> 00:44:59,377
What is he talking?

561
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:06,111
What do you want my friend?

562
00:45:08,634 --> 00:45:11,240
An umbrella would be nice,
but we're looking for...

563
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:13,041
What's her name?
- Stefanie Fernandes.

564
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,811
This is her husband, he
wants to tell her that.

565
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,670
Not like that.

566
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:23,006
This morning,
Stefanie Fernandes...

567
00:45:23,867 --> 00:45:26,871
runs away with my umbrella.

568
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,840
With your umbrella?

569
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,808
This morning?

570
00:45:31,867 --> 00:45:34,609
You must all sit.

571
00:45:37,467 --> 00:45:39,140
I come back.

572
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,604
Any pictures of Fanny?

573
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:52,313
I can't really tell.

574
00:45:54,734 --> 00:45:57,146
My name is Vladimir llyanova.

575
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,441
But you can call me
Vladimir llyanova.

576
00:46:06,334 --> 00:46:06,869
Both.

577
00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:08,173
Hey you?

578
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:11,238
Why you have brought yellow
flowers to my house.

579
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,541
Don't you know it's bad luck?

580
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,908
They are for Fanny.

581
00:46:15,234 --> 00:46:16,872
What is funny?

582
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,278
Fanny. - This is not funny.

583
00:46:19,334 --> 00:46:21,405
Stefanie Fernandes, remember?

584
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,207
Sir, Stefanie
Fernandes your wife?

585
00:46:27,567 --> 00:46:29,103
My wife...

586
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,271
My wife is in Russia, long dead.

587
00:46:34,967 --> 00:46:36,412
And my mother...

588
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:38,901
Can I offer...

589
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,412
Why are you doing this to me?

590
00:46:41,634 --> 00:46:44,342
Please take them outside.

591
00:46:47,367 --> 00:46:48,367
Excuse me.

592
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,276
This man has come looking
for Stefanie Fernandes.

593
00:46:51,534 --> 00:46:52,535
You know her, right?

594
00:46:54,434 --> 00:46:55,469
Vladimir?

595
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,142
Vladamir.

596
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,010
My mother named me Vladimir.
- Sir.

597
00:47:00,267 --> 00:47:02,873
You bought this house
from Stefanie Fernandes?

598
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,370
20 more years ago.

599
00:47:06,567 --> 00:47:07,739
Wonderful lady.

600
00:47:08,167 --> 00:47:10,169
She moved to Tivoli...

601
00:47:10,367 --> 00:47:13,246
that is few hours on the
other side from here.

602
00:47:14,567 --> 00:47:17,514
The government made
a lot of problems..

603
00:47:17,567 --> 00:47:19,706
""About selling to a foreigner.

604
00:47:20,567 --> 00:47:24,515
But... I had married an Indian.

605
00:47:25,267 --> 00:47:28,476
So... I got lucky.

606
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,510
Lovely lady Stefanie Fernandes.

607
00:48:39,367 --> 00:48:40,767
Just star-t the car
when I tell you.

608
00:48:44,334 --> 00:48:46,371
Savio. - Yes.

609
00:48:46,667 --> 00:48:47,737
Thanks.

610
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,272
For what?

611
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:52,839
I love her.

612
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:54,941
I really love her.

613
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,677
Hey, Savio.

614
00:49:36,634 --> 00:49:37,772
Tell you a secret?

615
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,300
Yeah...

616
00:49:41,767 --> 00:49:44,941
You know Albert and I
were shippies together.

617
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,336
Rosalina's husband, Albert.

618
00:49:49,467 --> 00:49:50,502
I heard.

619
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,909
We sailed together
that last time...

620
00:49:55,767 --> 00:49:59,340
just before he never came back.

621
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,838
So you were on the
ship when he died.

622
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,243
He didn't die.

623
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,308
He did not die. - What?

624
00:50:09,633 --> 00:50:10,907
Just never came back.

625
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:14,581
Just wrote her a letter saying
he's never coming back.

626
00:50:15,467 --> 00:50:16,468
Gave me to give her.

627
00:50:17,367 --> 00:50:19,404
But... wasn't there
a big memorial?

628
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,946
Rosalina, the pregnant widow...

629
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,377
Husband buried at sea.

630
00:50:24,267 --> 00:50:26,907
He found a girl in Madagascar.

631
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:28,475
Jumped ship, disappeared.

632
00:50:28,867 --> 00:50:31,108
What I mean is why
tell such a big lie?

633
00:50:35,167 --> 00:50:36,167
Of course.

634
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:38,967
Pride.

635
00:50:39,434 --> 00:50:41,778
Her bloody pride.

636
00:50:43,467 --> 00:50:45,174
That's why she hates
me, you know.

637
00:50:45,567 --> 00:50:46,967
Because I am the
only one who knows.

638
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,511
Apart from her and Albert.

639
00:50:50,367 --> 00:50:51,573
Now you know.

640
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,612
That explains her bitterness.

641
00:50:55,567 --> 00:50:56,807
Promise you won't tell her.

642
00:50:57,767 --> 00:50:58,973
Then why you told me?

643
00:51:01,734 --> 00:51:03,179
Be nice to her.

644
00:51:06,967 --> 00:51:07,968
Sometimes.

645
00:51:09,934 --> 00:51:10,934
Sometimes.

646
00:52:23,267 --> 00:52:24,940
When I was small, I
used to be an angel...

647
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
in feasts.

648
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,407
Do you want to hear a song?

649
00:52:42,434 --> 00:52:43,572
Okay then.

650
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,472
Either this car
doesn't use petrol...

651
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,294
or we need to get some
when we get to Tivoli.

652
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,805
You want to hear some songs
I wrote about Fanny?

653
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:31,609
No Ferdie, I would like to
know where that right turn is.

654
00:53:31,734 --> 00:53:32,974
It'll come.

655
00:53:33,067 --> 00:53:34,637
It'll come on the right.

656
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,645
Oh my little pussy.

657
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,276
Pussy. Pussy.

658
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:15,038
Pussy. Pussy.

659
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,100
Pussy.

660
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,373
You're such an
animal lover, Pedro.

661
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,306
Madame.

662
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,844
I've never loved an
animal as much as this...

663
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,408
lively little fellow.

664
00:54:26,434 --> 00:54:29,847
Give him to me, must be hungry.

665
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:30,742
No, no, no.

666
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,303
I assure you that
he's quite stuffed.

667
00:54:34,234 --> 00:54:36,771
Come, my little baby.

668
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,308
Come, come, come.

669
00:54:42,867 --> 00:54:44,312
That's it. On the right.

670
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,238
Stop. Stop the car.

671
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,103
Stop the car. - Why?

672
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,474
Stop the car.

673
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,572
Hello, everyone.

674
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,276
I just want you to say.

675
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,080
I could not have done
this without you all.

676
00:55:03,267 --> 00:55:05,027
What man, now you're
giving a speech or what?

677
00:55:06,867 --> 00:55:09,677
My Fanny's village
is just up ahead.

678
00:55:16,334 --> 00:55:19,042
I hope my hear-t doesn't
burst with happiness.

679
00:55:21,367 --> 00:55:23,142
When I meet Fanny...

680
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,712
I'll talk to her
only with my eyes.

681
00:55:28,967 --> 00:55:30,310
Might be a blessing.

682
00:55:31,434 --> 00:55:33,154
Why don't you do the
same for us, you idiot?

683
00:55:33,767 --> 00:55:34,871
Talk with your eyes only.

684
00:55:43,067 --> 00:55:46,310
Anyway... you all
made it possible.

685
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,079
Especially you, Angie.

686
00:55:49,334 --> 00:55:51,143
My hear-t was like a bird...

687
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,737
that could not fly.

688
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:56,804
It would never be able to fly...

689
00:55:56,867 --> 00:55:58,403
if it wasn't for you.

690
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,141
Thank you, Ferdinand.

691
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,577
Fernando. Fernando.

692
00:56:02,767 --> 00:56:04,440
Fanny always used to
call me Fernando.

693
00:56:07,767 --> 00:56:09,178
Not a bad speech.

694
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:12,776
You should have one ready
for Fanny if you see her.

695
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:15,100
Everybody ready?

696
00:56:15,967 --> 00:56:16,967
Everyone ready?

697
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,806
Start the car. Start the car.

698
00:56:18,867 --> 00:56:20,312
Everyone ready?

699
00:56:22,933 --> 00:56:24,037
Faster. Faster.

700
00:56:24,134 --> 00:56:25,841
Faster. Faster.

701
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,600
Give me the map.

702
00:56:36,667 --> 00:56:37,509
Why?

703
00:56:37,567 --> 00:56:39,308
You idiot, we're in
bloody Karnataka.

704
00:56:42,734 --> 00:56:44,236
Means what?

705
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:46,809
Means we've crossed
into another state.

706
00:56:47,834 --> 00:56:48,834
What state?

707
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,545
A bloody mental state.

708
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,938
He's shouting.

709
00:56:52,334 --> 00:56:53,472
Mad he's become or what?

710
00:56:56,267 --> 00:56:58,110
And you... please explain.

711
00:56:58,667 --> 00:57:00,613
When did I say I can read a map!

712
00:57:06,767 --> 00:57:10,374
The days in which I
had to fall in love.

713
00:57:10,733 --> 00:57:13,737
I spent all those days
writing letters to you.

714
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,304
O Fanny Re...

715
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,979
O Fanny Re...

716
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:25,478
All the happiness's of my life.

717
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:29,105
Got killed as I was lost in the
thoughts of Your whereabouts.

718
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,113
O Fanny Re...

719
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,303
O Fanny Re...

720
00:57:36,834 --> 00:57:40,407
O my beloved!

721
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,844
O Fanny Re...

722
00:57:44,567 --> 00:57:49,016
O Fanny Re...

723
00:57:49,067 --> 00:57:50,067
Now what?

724
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:51,712
Now... now what? We've
run out of petrol.

725
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:55,112
O Fanny Re...

726
00:57:58,834 --> 00:57:59,869
Savvy...

727
00:58:01,933 --> 00:58:03,037
Savio.

728
00:58:04,034 --> 00:58:05,034
Yeah, what?

729
00:58:05,333 --> 00:58:06,333
What are you doing?

730
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,343
Getting that bloody
idiot out of my system.

731
00:58:08,834 --> 00:58:10,745
I didn't sign up for this bullshit.
- Oh, sorry.

732
00:58:10,834 --> 00:58:11,834
For what?

733
00:58:12,067 --> 00:58:14,911
My fault, trusting that
fool to read a map.

734
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,280
It's like a chimpanzee
reading Shakespeare.

735
00:58:17,367 --> 00:58:19,574
It's not that bad.
- Not that bad?

736
00:58:20,067 --> 00:58:21,637
And that painter bullshitter!

737
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,475
Madame this. Madame that.

738
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:24,873
What Madame?!

739
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,670
She's just a fat old cow.

740
00:58:28,134 --> 00:58:29,442
They are old people, Savvy...

741
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,342
and old people will
be old people.

742
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,936
You can't change that. - Right.

743
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,360
They get away with a lot
of shit, old people.

744
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,367
Good excuse.

745
00:58:35,667 --> 00:58:37,044
If you stay alive long enough..

746
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,220
People eventually forget
that you were born stupid.

747
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,038
What's your problem?

748
00:58:41,534 --> 00:58:42,706
You've more than most people do.

749
00:58:42,767 --> 00:58:45,008
So why are you complaining all the time?
- One second.

750
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:45,874
What do I have?

751
00:58:45,934 --> 00:58:46,934
What do I have?

752
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,074
20 dentures.

753
00:58:48,167 --> 00:58:50,374
10 shins, 5 pants, 3
socks and 2 underwear.

754
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,874
That's all dear daddy left me.

755
00:58:52,234 --> 00:58:53,542
Oh, did I forget to mention?

756
00:58:53,634 --> 00:58:54,977
One bloody falling down house.

757
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,377
Well, I can't complain.

758
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:00,504
I never had any daddy,
dentures or house.

759
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,604
Oh, please, spare me your
little orphanage sob story.

760
00:59:03,767 --> 00:59:05,212
Poor Angie, alone in this world.

761
00:59:05,267 --> 00:59:07,067
You let her rule over you.
That's your choice.

762
00:59:22,167 --> 00:59:23,475
Look, Angie, I'm sorry.

763
00:59:23,934 --> 00:59:25,607
I really have nothing
against you.

764
00:59:26,534 --> 00:59:30,346
And if anything,
you're the only one...

765
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,504
If it wasn't for you...

766
00:59:35,967 --> 00:59:37,247
I would've killed
someone by now.

767
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,100
Listen...

768
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:45,540
maybe if we plan wisely..

769
00:59:45,633 --> 00:59:47,476
We can do up the
house slowly-slowly.

770
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,339
Till then I'll come and
help you clean the house.

771
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,404
What?

772
00:59:56,967 --> 00:59:58,105
What?

773
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,909
There's no money
in Mumbai, Angie.

774
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:07,676
But the business?
- What business?

775
01:00:09,067 --> 01:00:10,910
I was a bloody
waiter for 5 years.

776
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,376
Slept on the same
tables I served.

777
01:00:18,067 --> 01:00:19,239
So you lied.

778
01:00:27,934 --> 01:00:29,345
I'll still help you
clean the house.

779
01:00:33,567 --> 01:00:34,637
For free.

780
01:00:40,634 --> 01:00:42,136
Lomos Del Toro.

781
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,973
One of the finest brandies
known to man, Madame.

782
01:00:52,833 --> 01:00:53,937
This is good.

783
01:00:56,167 --> 01:00:57,167
You're classy.

784
01:00:57,533 --> 01:00:58,533
Classy, Don Pedro.

785
01:00:58,734 --> 01:00:59,804
Indeed, Madame.

786
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:04,241
I see that you have a fine palette
of a sailor on shore leave.

787
01:01:05,367 --> 01:01:07,540
No doubt that you got
it from your husband.

788
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:09,207
Husband.

789
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,938
May his soul rest in peace.

790
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:18,938
You think he's watching?

791
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,535
Let him.

792
01:01:22,934 --> 01:01:24,971
I mean why should he alone
have fun in heaven?

793
01:01:27,834 --> 01:01:30,474
He had lots of fun, nonstop.

794
01:01:31,134 --> 01:01:33,740
These sailors, dirty people.

795
01:01:34,667 --> 01:01:36,647
No respect for their
wives at home.

796
01:01:36,867 --> 01:01:38,710
But my Albert wasn't like that.

797
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:41,110
My Albert was very faithful.

798
01:01:41,834 --> 01:01:44,212
If I were your
husband, Madame...

799
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,813
I wouldn't go away from
you even for a moment.

800
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,673
All lies. You men all lies.

801
01:01:50,334 --> 01:01:52,814
If you don't go to
work, who'll earn?

802
01:01:52,867 --> 01:01:54,073
Your father?

803
01:01:55,133 --> 01:01:56,510
Of course.

804
01:01:57,967 --> 01:01:59,537
How is the brandy, dear lady?

805
01:02:01,034 --> 01:02:04,413
Call me Rosie no,
nobody else does.

806
01:02:06,334 --> 01:02:07,870
Rosie.

807
01:02:14,667 --> 01:02:16,544
Now the picture is perfect.

808
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,680
I used to miss you
in the beginning...

809
01:02:20,634 --> 01:02:24,446
until I started enjoying
thinking about you.

810
01:02:25,534 --> 01:02:26,534
About us.

811
01:02:27,467 --> 01:02:28,707
You know I used to make
up my own stories.

812
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,713
About what could've happened if
things had gone differently.

813
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,704
If... life hadn't changed...

814
01:02:35,934 --> 01:02:37,311
or you hadn't left Goa...

815
01:02:40,234 --> 01:02:41,872
Mumbai wasn't easy.

816
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:45,106
Memories were all I had...

817
01:02:47,334 --> 01:02:48,506
So it's a deal then?

818
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:51,502
What deal?

819
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:57,207
I want the old Savio back.
Same old...

820
01:03:03,267 --> 01:03:04,439
Jesus Christ, what the
hell was that for?

821
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,780
You've gone mad or what, Savio?!

822
01:03:05,933 --> 01:03:06,933
I've gone mad?

823
01:03:07,267 --> 01:03:08,109
So what were you thinking?

824
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,420
I'm good for a little charity,
a little house-clean...

825
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:11,738
but a peck on the lips
and I've gone mad?

826
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,006
What am I thinking?

827
01:03:13,267 --> 01:03:14,439
What are you thinking?

828
01:03:14,534 --> 01:03:17,572
So what was all that
'we' stuff about?

829
01:03:17,634 --> 01:03:18,635
We'll clean the house.

830
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:19,970
What was all that about?

831
01:03:20,033 --> 01:03:22,513
We, Savio. You and I,
aren't we even friends now?

832
01:03:22,734 --> 01:03:23,734
Friends?

833
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,571
Aren't you fed up of
this friends bullshit?

834
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,560
Back then we were friends,
now we're friends!

835
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:34,838
Why the hell did you
say yes to him...

836
01:03:34,934 --> 01:03:36,743
when you knew you loved me more?

837
01:03:40,767 --> 01:03:41,802
Why?

838
01:03:43,134 --> 01:03:44,613
Just because he asked you first?

839
01:03:46,534 --> 01:03:47,535
No, Savio.

840
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,838
Because you never asked.

841
01:03:59,934 --> 01:04:01,709
Are you mad creeping
up like this?

842
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,175
I would've knocked
but there's no door.

843
01:04:04,334 --> 01:04:07,178
You could have at least cleared
your throat or something...

844
01:04:07,234 --> 01:04:09,214
My throat is not blocked.
- Okay.

845
01:04:10,133 --> 01:04:13,444
I came to tell you all...

846
01:04:14,367 --> 01:04:15,573
my decision.

847
01:04:16,834 --> 01:04:19,371
Romeo of Pocolim is going
to make another speech.

848
01:04:20,567 --> 01:04:22,513
Anyway, I want you
all to know...

849
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:26,709
that tomorrow morning I
am going for petrol.

850
01:04:28,367 --> 01:04:29,903
The only reason I
am not going now...

851
01:04:29,967 --> 01:04:32,004
is because I am
scared of the dark.

852
01:04:33,034 --> 01:04:34,809
And I can't cure that overnight.

853
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,007
It is almost impossible...

854
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,409
to conquer the fear of
the dark in the day.

855
01:04:40,767 --> 01:04:41,871
Too much light.

856
01:04:46,734 --> 01:04:48,111
And also there's.

857
01:04:48,333 --> 01:04:49,641
I am scared of snakes.

858
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,304
There are too many
snakes in Goa.

859
01:04:52,134 --> 01:04:53,272
For the first time,
Ferdinand is thinking.

860
01:04:53,367 --> 01:04:57,611
About somebody else
instead of himself.

861
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,104
I'm impressed.

862
01:05:01,734 --> 01:05:03,008
Do whatever you like.

863
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,180
I'm not in a hurry to go home...

864
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:06,611
as long as she's by my side.

865
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:07,610
Your choice.

866
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:09,646
You stay here, go back...
Whatever.

867
01:05:11,334 --> 01:05:12,813
I am going to look for Fanny.

868
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:21,044
Wait. Ferdie, come here.

869
01:05:21,134 --> 01:05:22,306
Come, come.

870
01:05:22,567 --> 01:05:23,671
Have some brandy.

871
01:05:24,634 --> 01:05:26,545
There is no third glass, Madame.

872
01:05:26,834 --> 01:05:28,814
Come. Sit, drink from my glass.

873
01:05:29,067 --> 01:05:30,067
Come.

874
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,670
Listen, I don't want to fight.

875
01:06:01,967 --> 01:06:03,002
Listen Angie, screw you.

876
01:06:03,067 --> 01:06:04,187
What have you come back for?

877
01:06:04,234 --> 01:06:05,611
I don't want your sympathy.

878
01:06:06,167 --> 01:06:07,475
You think you're very tough...

879
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:10,140
to use whatever language you
choose to especially with a girl?

880
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:13,377
Girl?
- I'll smack your face, Savio.

881
01:06:14,034 --> 01:06:15,308
I'm not scared of you
or your language...

882
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,277
or your stupid attitude.

883
01:06:17,567 --> 01:06:19,012
Go away, I've nothing
to say to you.

884
01:06:19,167 --> 01:06:20,976
That's always been the
problem with you.

885
01:06:23,367 --> 01:06:24,812
You think something was there?

886
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,640
What did you think was there?

887
01:06:26,967 --> 01:06:29,311
You and I were..

888
01:06:30,867 --> 01:06:32,778
We were close, remember.

889
01:06:33,167 --> 01:06:34,407
We were 18, Savio.

890
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,671
No, you were 18, I was 20.

891
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,109
Shit. I'm such an idiot.

892
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,873
Why didn't I just say it then?

893
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:45,027
You know, you're
worse than Ferdie.

894
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,876
He at least said it but
Fanny never heard.

895
01:06:48,767 --> 01:06:52,510
But you... proud
Savio Da Gama...

896
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,307
couldn't say what
was in your heart.

897
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:55,903
No, Angie...

898
01:06:58,634 --> 01:06:59,942
Now let me speak, okay.

899
01:07:01,467 --> 01:07:03,640
The first time I was kissed
was on my wedding day.

900
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,278
And 15 minutes later my
husband choked and died..

901
01:07:07,367 --> 01:07:08,812
On his own wedding cake.

902
01:07:10,967 --> 01:07:12,913
It's not the chicken
bone as the story goes.

903
01:07:14,167 --> 01:07:16,647
The bride and groom figurines on
the cake were made of plastic.

904
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,074
Not icing.

905
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,245
His mother was trying
to save money.

906
01:07:23,734 --> 01:07:25,680
And her son was so drunk that.

907
01:07:26,067 --> 01:07:28,707
By the time he realized it
was halfway down his throat.

908
01:07:32,834 --> 01:07:35,280
That was my first and last
kiss and it was 6 years ago.

909
01:07:38,467 --> 01:07:40,879
You think I did something
wrong by slapping you today?

910
01:07:42,434 --> 01:07:43,434
Huh?

911
01:07:43,534 --> 01:07:44,808
Is your ego hum?

912
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,035
Where does it hum?

913
01:07:55,234 --> 01:07:56,269
You think after
waiting 6 years...

914
01:07:56,367 --> 01:07:58,438
a girl would not like
it to be done properly?

915
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:00,600
No...

916
01:08:01,234 --> 01:08:02,406
I mean yes.

917
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:07,402
So then finish what you started.

918
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,277
Sure about this, I mean..

919
01:08:14,467 --> 01:08:15,810
I don't really...

920
01:08:19,167 --> 01:08:21,943
No, I've had too much already.

921
01:08:22,267 --> 01:08:23,473
You have.

922
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:25,702
Forget it.

923
01:08:27,467 --> 01:08:29,913
Too much liquor is bad
for me, you know.

924
01:08:30,567 --> 01:08:32,103
It affects my legs.

925
01:08:34,167 --> 01:08:35,167
Gout?

926
01:08:35,667 --> 01:08:36,771
No.

927
01:08:39,434 --> 01:08:40,811
It makes them spread.

928
01:08:44,933 --> 01:08:46,776
You remember the
old days, Ferdie?

929
01:08:46,867 --> 01:08:49,780
Albert, you and me, we
used to have so much fun.

930
01:08:52,667 --> 01:08:53,475
Ferdie.

931
01:08:53,667 --> 01:08:54,702
Ferdie, thanks.

932
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,239
You always knew about
Albert and me.

933
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:03,004
That bastard.

934
01:09:08,334 --> 01:09:11,781
I never asked you to... but
still you didn't tell.

935
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,810
Thanks for keeping my secret...

936
01:09:18,467 --> 01:09:19,537
a secret.

937
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,236
Thanks Ferdie.

938
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:30,300
Angie.

939
01:09:32,534 --> 01:09:33,774
Angie, you okay?

940
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:40,804
Would you like a cigarette?

941
01:09:41,934 --> 01:09:43,777
Like a tradition afterwards.

942
01:09:51,234 --> 01:09:52,440
Angie, really are you okay?

943
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:54,238
I am okay. Just...

944
01:09:55,334 --> 01:09:56,642
lying and watching the stars.

945
01:09:58,367 --> 01:10:00,047
Look here, I want to
make sure you're okay.

946
01:10:01,367 --> 01:10:02,367
I am okay.

947
01:10:03,767 --> 01:10:05,007
Talk to me, baby.

948
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,371
Despite what everyone says
about men wanting to...

949
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:11,137
turn around and fall
asleep after...

950
01:10:12,134 --> 01:10:13,408
That's also a tradition?

951
01:10:20,567 --> 01:10:23,104
I thought she's going
to come and check.

952
01:10:24,301 --> 01:10:25,301
Who?

953
01:10:27,701 --> 01:10:29,112
You were making bit of a sound.

954
01:10:30,767 --> 01:10:32,041
What are you mumbling about?

955
01:10:33,534 --> 01:10:34,877
Angie, you know who?

956
01:10:37,534 --> 01:10:39,104
Again you're talking about Mai.

957
01:10:41,234 --> 01:10:43,214
Why are we always
talking about Mai?

958
01:10:43,534 --> 01:10:45,172
Don't be naive, Angie.

959
01:10:46,934 --> 01:10:49,073
What are you going to
tell Rosie about us?

960
01:10:50,034 --> 01:10:51,034
Mad or what?

961
01:10:51,334 --> 01:10:52,574
Why will I tell her anything?

962
01:10:53,767 --> 01:10:54,802
What do you mean?

963
01:10:55,767 --> 01:10:57,110
This is a one-time
thing for you?

964
01:10:57,634 --> 01:10:58,669
That's all this is?

965
01:10:59,234 --> 01:11:00,304
I didn't say that.

966
01:11:01,034 --> 01:11:04,015
I'm hoping there'll
be many more times...

967
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:07,013
and I'm hoping it will
get better also, no?

968
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:08,700
Better?

969
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:12,804
What do you mean better?

970
01:11:13,634 --> 01:11:15,045
Is this the best it ever gets?

971
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,905
No... but... I mean..

972
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:21,637
So, better?

973
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,275
My sky. - What?

974
01:11:35,067 --> 01:11:36,740
You're in the way of my sky.

975
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:39,835
Yeah, fine.

976
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,200
Hey!

977
01:11:51,067 --> 01:11:52,705
Listen, if I had
not come to you...

978
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:54,487
you would still be sitting
here and sulking.

979
01:11:56,034 --> 01:11:57,513
So let me do what I want no...

980
01:11:59,734 --> 01:12:00,734
Better?

981
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,879
Somebody should go with Ferdie.

982
01:12:38,367 --> 01:12:39,710
He won't know what to get.

983
01:12:40,534 --> 01:12:42,844
You think he'll bring back
apple juice in a jerry can?

984
01:12:45,301 --> 01:12:46,644
But what if he gets lost?

985
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,970
He got lost a long time ago.

986
01:12:53,401 --> 01:12:54,539
Somebody's coming.

987
01:12:54,867 --> 01:12:56,972
Bring back some apple juice.

988
01:13:04,534 --> 01:13:06,514
Good morning. - Morning.

989
01:13:13,767 --> 01:13:16,043
Someone should look
out for Ferdie.

990
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:20,304
Of course, you go.

991
01:13:20,501 --> 01:13:21,571
You and M.F Hussain.

992
01:13:22,034 --> 01:13:22,910
You look out for him...

993
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,480
while Hussain can
look at more of you.

994
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,873
Don't think I don't know what's
going on in your dirty mind.

995
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:29,300
My dirty mind?

996
01:13:29,467 --> 01:13:30,947
Wait till he takes
out his paintbrush.

997
01:13:30,967 --> 01:13:32,241
Then tell me dirty mind.

998
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:33,772
I don't want to talk to you.

999
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,707
The moment is at hand, my lady.

1000
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:43,861
What are you going
to do with this?

1001
01:13:44,367 --> 01:13:49,043
With this brush I will
awaken the soul that...

1002
01:13:50,334 --> 01:13:51,904
exists within this
beautiful body.

1003
01:13:52,934 --> 01:13:54,675
And put colors on to it...

1004
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:56,937
the world does not
have names for yet.

1005
01:13:57,767 --> 01:13:59,405
With each dab of paint...

1006
01:14:00,801 --> 01:14:03,475
I will give your
beautiful soul..

1007
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,279
A new skin.

1008
01:14:08,467 --> 01:14:12,381
God will wish he had left the
creation of women to Pedro.

1009
01:14:20,734 --> 01:14:21,735
Angie, I am sorry.

1010
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:23,475
Sorry for being such an idiot.

1011
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,340
I don't know much
about these things.

1012
01:14:28,934 --> 01:14:30,004
And I don't smoke.

1013
01:14:32,601 --> 01:14:33,636
But maybe if I did...

1014
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:36,369
I would be the one who would want
to roll over and smoke a cigarette.

1015
01:14:36,434 --> 01:14:37,936
After we make love.

1016
01:14:40,567 --> 01:14:41,773
Do you understand?

1017
01:14:43,067 --> 01:14:44,067
Yes.

1018
01:15:13,167 --> 01:15:14,168
Put your hands up!

1019
01:15:15,834 --> 01:15:16,972
And stay there!

1020
01:15:33,601 --> 01:15:34,601
Madame Eucharistica.

1021
01:15:35,034 --> 01:15:36,874
Drop the cloth a little
off the other shoulder.

1022
01:15:37,901 --> 01:15:39,710
I am not so sure. - Drop it.

1023
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:44,545
This is an, my dear.

1024
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,104
No compromises.

1025
01:15:49,934 --> 01:15:53,381
Don Pedro, I'm not
comfortable wearing this...

1026
01:15:57,034 --> 01:15:58,240
I assure you, Madame.

1027
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:00,777
This sheet is not
even in my painting.

1028
01:16:02,067 --> 01:16:03,307
So, stay like this.

1029
01:16:08,767 --> 01:16:09,767
Yes, that's better.

1030
01:16:19,234 --> 01:16:20,394
Where the hell are those two?

1031
01:16:21,167 --> 01:16:23,147
Don Pedro is painting
a portrait of Mai.

1032
01:16:24,201 --> 01:16:25,201
And she agreed?

1033
01:16:26,434 --> 01:16:27,572
It's for the church.

1034
01:16:29,234 --> 01:16:30,234
Church?

1035
01:16:31,734 --> 01:16:33,614
You have not seen the
famous Don Pedro's work...

1036
01:16:37,334 --> 01:16:38,334
Church.

1037
01:16:38,967 --> 01:16:40,469
This is beautiful.

1038
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,446
Seldom have I been so wrong...

1039
01:16:50,267 --> 01:16:51,267
in recognizing someone.

1040
01:16:51,567 --> 01:16:52,671
How can somebody so
magnificent to look at.

1041
01:16:52,734 --> 01:16:55,146
Be so completely
empty from the inside?

1042
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,443
Where had your mind been...

1043
01:16:59,634 --> 01:17:01,978
while your body was
working its magic...

1044
01:17:03,001 --> 01:17:06,141
filling itself out, becoming a
deadly lure for the artist.

1045
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:10,438
You know the hardest pan of
finishing this painting, Madame?

1046
01:17:14,167 --> 01:17:15,167
Your eyes.

1047
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,377
Where is your soul?

1048
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:20,471
I do not see.

1049
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,635
So...

1050
01:17:23,734 --> 01:17:25,372
I had to make it up.

1051
01:17:29,067 --> 01:17:31,946
It's like making love to you
and thinking of another.

1052
01:17:34,667 --> 01:17:35,667
You're free to go.

1053
01:17:36,534 --> 01:17:37,534
I am done with you.

1054
01:18:02,934 --> 01:18:07,610
Dear Angie, madam Rosalina,
Don Pedro and Savio...

1055
01:18:09,534 --> 01:18:11,411
sorry for dragging
you all into this.

1056
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:14,345
But I needed you all
to help me start.

1057
01:18:16,867 --> 01:18:19,404
I don't expect you to
understand my love for Fanny.

1058
01:18:19,767 --> 01:18:21,440
I understand it hardly.

1059
01:18:22,167 --> 01:18:23,874
What I understand is this.

1060
01:18:23,967 --> 01:18:26,208
You won't find
anything by waiting...

1061
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:28,246
but only by searching.

1062
01:18:31,834 --> 01:18:34,314
Angie, you're the
daughter I never had.

1063
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:36,674
And you're the wife I
hope Fanny will be.

1064
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,946
And I wish my mother
had been like you.

1065
01:18:41,934 --> 01:18:44,847
Whoever you touch is the
luckiest bugger in the world.

1066
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:46,846
Even if they don't know it then.

1067
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:50,402
Don Pedro, I'm sure
you'll make...

1068
01:18:50,467 --> 01:18:52,879
""the lovely madam Rosalina
famous in your painting.

1069
01:18:54,534 --> 01:18:57,174
I hope each one of you fulfils
something in your life.

1070
01:18:58,534 --> 01:19:00,707
Will I see you again?
Maybe, maybe not.

1071
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,137
I don't know.

1072
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,237
Good. Now we can go back.

1073
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,946
I guess it's his own
journey from here on.

1074
01:19:13,134 --> 01:19:14,306
I mean...

1075
01:19:14,867 --> 01:19:16,707
we were meant to be with
him only up till here.

1076
01:19:20,834 --> 01:19:21,834
Come.

1077
01:19:25,567 --> 01:19:27,342
Wait. - It's time to go home.

1078
01:19:28,901 --> 01:19:30,505
What do you mean by going home?

1079
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:33,670
How can we go without Ferdie?

1080
01:19:33,934 --> 01:19:36,813
Have you all gone mad?

1081
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:38,743
Let go.

1082
01:19:38,834 --> 01:19:41,144
And you... you don't care
about anybody else..

1083
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,305
""But yourself. - Mai...

1084
01:19:43,367 --> 01:19:45,369
You're selfish, you selfish...

1085
01:19:45,434 --> 01:19:48,108
Good for nothing.
That's what you are.

1086
01:19:49,667 --> 01:19:51,544
It should've been you that day.

1087
01:19:51,767 --> 01:19:53,269
Not my Gabo.

1088
01:19:54,134 --> 01:19:55,909
Gabo shouldn't have died.

1089
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,638
Leave me, Angie.

1090
01:19:59,534 --> 01:20:01,104
Do you know why he married her?

1091
01:20:01,167 --> 01:20:02,167
Do you know?

1092
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,905
Because he always
wanted what you wanted.

1093
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:08,603
God takes away the good and
leaves behind the trash.

1094
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,104
My Gabo should've lived..

1095
01:20:11,167 --> 01:20:13,167
You should've died.
- This is not Pocolim, okay.

1096
01:20:13,234 --> 01:20:14,736
This isn't your house.

1097
01:20:14,801 --> 01:20:16,474
Or your daddy's village.

1098
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:18,776
And I am selfish?

1099
01:20:18,834 --> 01:20:20,541
I am selfish? - Yes.

1100
01:20:20,967 --> 01:20:22,207
All your life you've
been strutting around...

1101
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:23,244
parading your false pride!

1102
01:20:23,334 --> 01:20:24,074
And I am selfish?

1103
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:26,579
Shut up.
- I'll show you who's bloody selfish, wait.

1104
01:20:26,767 --> 01:20:27,438
Where are you going?

1105
01:20:27,534 --> 01:20:29,946
Mai. - Where are you
going now, you coward.

1106
01:20:30,801 --> 01:20:32,405
Don't you do anything to my cat.

1107
01:20:32,501 --> 01:20:35,880
Cat. Your bloody precious cat.
Here.

1108
01:20:36,134 --> 01:20:37,977
Your bloody cat has been
dead this whole time.

1109
01:20:38,034 --> 01:20:39,707
As dead as your bloody son.

1110
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Have you fed it once?

1111
01:20:41,001 --> 01:20:42,309
Looked after it once?

1112
01:20:42,501 --> 01:20:44,606
Are we your pop's servants
to take care of it...

1113
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:46,060
while you pose
around like a model?

1114
01:20:50,034 --> 01:20:51,809
And now suddenly Ferdie
this, Ferdie that.

1115
01:20:52,434 --> 01:20:54,004
All your life you treat
him like shit...

1116
01:20:54,067 --> 01:20:55,375
and now suddenly it's Ferdie.

1117
01:20:55,567 --> 01:20:57,012
Ferdie my ass!

1118
01:20:58,667 --> 01:20:59,805
Done with this shit.

1119
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,979
Hey, you found daddy's gun.
- Let me die.

1120
01:22:16,034 --> 01:22:17,980
Found his gun..
- Let me die. Let me die.

1121
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:28,835
You found his gun.

1122
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:30,180
Thank you so much
for finding it.

1123
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,480
Do you know how much it's worth?

1124
01:22:32,234 --> 01:22:33,304
How much?

1125
01:22:34,667 --> 01:22:35,975
How much?

1126
01:22:37,267 --> 01:22:38,371
What are you doing?

1127
01:22:38,567 --> 01:22:39,841
We're going back? - What?

1128
01:22:41,101 --> 01:22:42,381
I don't know what
I was thinking.

1129
01:22:42,434 --> 01:22:44,380
We'll have to go
back for Ferdie.

1130
01:22:44,434 --> 01:22:45,242
For Ferdie?

1131
01:22:45,434 --> 01:22:46,708
I am the one who
slipped the letter..

1132
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,840
Under his door that night.

1133
01:22:47,867 --> 01:22:48,867
What?

1134
01:22:50,134 --> 01:22:52,174
Found it when I was going
through daddy's old stuff.

1135
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:53,642
Like everything else in life..

1136
01:22:53,901 --> 01:22:55,642
Daddy must have messed up again.

1137
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,807
Yes, now I remember.

1138
01:22:59,234 --> 01:23:01,874
Jesus Christ, you think
even this is about you?!

1139
01:23:02,434 --> 01:23:04,004
It's about your
daddy, you idiot.

1140
01:23:04,334 --> 01:23:05,836
Loyolla was the
postmaster that time.

1141
01:23:07,967 --> 01:23:10,277
Daddy was surely a
man of many talents.

1142
01:23:34,067 --> 01:23:35,808
Ferdie! Ferdie! Ferdie!

1143
01:23:36,234 --> 01:23:38,009
Ferdie! - Ferdie!

1144
01:23:38,101 --> 01:23:38,841
Ferdie!

1145
01:23:38,934 --> 01:23:40,413
Stop the car.
- Are you mad, stop the car!

1146
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,446
Shit the bloody car's brakes are failed!
- Stop the car.

1147
01:23:42,567 --> 01:23:43,807
Stop the car, Savio.

1148
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:45,538
The brakes have failed!!

1149
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,045
Give it to me. - Stop the car.

1150
01:23:47,134 --> 01:23:48,943
Mad woman, leave the steering.

1151
01:23:51,501 --> 01:23:53,503
Stop.
- Leave the steering, you fat cow.

1152
01:23:53,567 --> 01:23:55,547
Give me the steering.
- Stop her, Angie.

1153
01:23:56,234 --> 01:23:58,908
Savio..

1154
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:07,842
I don't want to die.

1155
01:24:07,934 --> 01:24:08,708
You stupid fat cow.

1156
01:24:08,767 --> 01:24:10,041
Bloody two minutes back you
wanted to kill yourself.

1157
01:24:10,134 --> 01:24:11,654
Now you don't want to die.
Are you mad?

1158
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,800
Stop the car. Stop the car. Savio, please.
- Leave.

1159
01:24:31,634 --> 01:24:32,669
Mai!

1160
01:24:33,767 --> 01:24:35,007
Mai!

1161
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:37,270
Mai!

1162
01:24:38,134 --> 01:24:39,134
It's okay.

1163
01:24:39,434 --> 01:24:40,469
It's okay.

1164
01:24:40,734 --> 01:24:42,042
Come, come.

1165
01:24:42,167 --> 01:24:43,373
Where are we?

1166
01:24:51,301 --> 01:24:52,575
We are okay.

1167
01:24:54,434 --> 01:24:55,344
Idiot.

1168
01:24:55,434 --> 01:24:56,435
Move.

1169
01:24:58,534 --> 01:24:59,808
I nearly died.

1170
01:25:00,467 --> 01:25:01,741
So did we.

1171
01:25:13,267 --> 01:25:14,267
Hey...

1172
01:25:15,801 --> 01:25:16,973
where's Don Pedro?

1173
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,320
I saw that bloody
selfish bastard.

1174
01:25:19,367 --> 01:25:21,074
He jumped off to save himself.
- No.

1175
01:25:21,267 --> 01:25:23,027
I asked for help and he
slapped my hand away.

1176
01:25:23,967 --> 01:25:25,776
I saw that, Mai. - You're okay?

1177
01:25:29,067 --> 01:25:30,137
Don Pedro.

1178
01:25:30,234 --> 01:25:31,304
Heyâ

1179
01:25:31,367 --> 01:25:32,243
Heyâ

1180
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:35,281
Go, go, run you selfish
coward bastard.

1181
01:25:35,334 --> 01:25:36,334
Go!

1182
01:26:15,467 --> 01:26:16,810
Great.

1183
01:26:17,567 --> 01:26:19,308
Even after reaching,
we can't reach.

1184
01:26:21,501 --> 01:26:23,447
Let's find out where she lives?

1185
01:26:31,934 --> 01:26:33,140
Oh, my God!

1186
01:26:34,934 --> 01:26:36,106
Fanny!

1187
01:26:36,367 --> 01:26:37,607
Which one?

1188
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:40,100
Where?

1189
01:26:47,267 --> 01:26:48,940
Come on, Ferdie, go for it.

1190
01:26:49,834 --> 01:26:51,836
You've waited your
entire life for this.

1191
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:06,438
No, l... l think I'll wait only.

1192
01:27:07,034 --> 01:27:09,014
Ferdie. Hey, Ferdie.

1193
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Go on.

1194
01:27:33,634 --> 01:27:34,635
You sure?

1195
01:27:48,101 --> 01:27:49,101
Ferdie, wait.

1196
01:28:34,201 --> 01:28:35,201
Fanny.

1197
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:38,301
Fanny.

1198
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,172
It's me, Ferdie.

1199
01:28:42,634 --> 01:28:43,634
Fanny.

1200
01:28:43,934 --> 01:28:45,140
What the hell are you doing?

1201
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:48,204
Oh, I am sorry.

1202
01:28:50,401 --> 01:28:52,176
I thought you were Fanny.

1203
01:28:52,767 --> 01:28:53,939
Who the hell is Fanny?

1204
01:28:54,001 --> 01:28:56,538
Fanny. Stefanie Fernandes.

1205
01:28:58,101 --> 01:28:59,307
Just get away.

1206
01:29:00,734 --> 01:29:02,077
Stefanie is my mother.

1207
01:29:05,434 --> 01:29:06,708
Where is she?

1208
01:29:14,034 --> 01:29:15,034
No...

1209
01:29:16,234 --> 01:29:17,234
It can't be.

1210
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:18,601
No.

1211
01:29:19,634 --> 01:29:20,942
It can't be.

1212
01:29:37,234 --> 01:29:38,234
Are you...

1213
01:29:39,701 --> 01:29:40,941
You're sure it is her?

1214
01:29:42,634 --> 01:29:43,634
Means what?

1215
01:29:44,534 --> 01:29:46,104
She doesn't look like..

1216
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:50,940
She's wearing a wedding dress.

1217
01:29:51,867 --> 01:29:54,279
Shouldn't she be..
- Recently married, no?

1218
01:29:57,267 --> 01:29:58,610
I knew it.

1219
01:30:00,401 --> 01:30:04,178
My Fanny waited for
me all these years.

1220
01:30:04,934 --> 01:30:06,572
And now she got married.

1221
01:30:06,934 --> 01:30:08,242
Fourth time...

1222
01:30:10,867 --> 01:30:13,780
What did you say your name was?
- Ferdie.

1223
01:30:15,834 --> 01:30:16,869
Ferdinand.

1224
01:30:18,867 --> 01:30:21,143
She used to call me Fernando.

1225
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:29,170
Did she... ever
mention that name?

1226
01:30:32,267 --> 01:30:33,405
Yes... l guess there was..

1227
01:30:35,134 --> 01:30:36,909
No, that was Kennedy.

1228
01:30:37,434 --> 01:30:40,972
And then there were
Joe, Joel, Jacinto...

1229
01:30:42,001 --> 01:30:44,140
John, Peter, Joe.

1230
01:30:45,001 --> 01:30:46,503
Mai mentioned many, many names.

1231
01:30:47,301 --> 01:30:48,746
What a colorful life she had.

1232
01:30:49,767 --> 01:30:51,405
But no, sorry.

1233
01:30:51,967 --> 01:30:53,878
She never mentioned
any Fernando.

1234
01:31:34,901 --> 01:31:36,346
And that was it, really.

1235
01:31:36,534 --> 01:31:38,844
We set out like brave
adventurers to find love.

1236
01:31:39,867 --> 01:31:40,868
Look at us...

1237
01:31:40,967 --> 01:31:43,447
None of us would know love..

1238
01:31:43,534 --> 01:31:45,070
If it punched us in the nose.

1239
01:31:50,667 --> 01:31:52,510
Pretending like we knew
anything about anything...

1240
01:31:52,567 --> 01:31:53,807
in the first place.

1241
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,580
Pretending like we
were wiser now.

1242
01:32:01,534 --> 01:32:03,411
I wanted to tell Ferdie
that it was okay.

1243
01:32:04,301 --> 01:32:05,575
But he wouldn't understand.

1244
01:32:10,634 --> 01:32:12,477
I wanted to tell him
that people die..

1245
01:32:12,734 --> 01:32:14,270
""But love never does.

1246
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:21,173
As for Don Pedro, his pan in
our lives was only that much.

1247
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:27,179
I guess he must be stroking
his paintbrush somewhere.

1248
01:32:27,267 --> 01:32:29,508
Thinking about Rosie with
his strange kind of love.

1249
01:32:30,534 --> 01:32:33,174
So yeah, love never dies.

1250
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:35,812
It's always there, somewhere.

1251
01:32:36,734 --> 01:32:38,736
And sometimes you
just have to find it.

1252
01:32:41,134 --> 01:32:44,843
Even if there's no unsent
letter waiting at your door.

1253
01:32:46,101 --> 01:32:48,411
If love doesn't come
knocking, just knock.

1254
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:50,645
Even if there is no door.

1255

Yes, by God.. This
is a din road.

1438
01:55:36,467 --> 01:55:39,744
Now you only tell your PIN code.

1439
01:55:39,801 --> 01:55:43,908
O, my Fanny is so funky

1440
01:55:43,967 --> 01:55:47,710
O, my Fanny, is a
complete drama company

1441
01:55:48,001 --> 01:55:51,972
O, my Fanny is a butterfly,
she flies away..

1442
01:55:52,034 --> 01:55:55,709
O, I am not able to
catch my Fanny..

1443
01:55:56,101 --> 01:55:57,842
Hey

1444
01:55:57,900 --> 01:56:00,904
Shake your booty on the floor

1445
01:56:03,401 --> 01:56:08,043
Hey.. Shake your
booty on the floor

1446
01:56:08,734 --> 01:56:11,681
O Faniya.. O Faniya..

1447
01:56:13,601 --> 01:56:15,547
Shake your booty on the floor

1448
01:56:15,634 --> 01:56:19,446
Shake your booty on the floor

1449
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:25,502
Shut the faniya man!

1450

00:03:28,316 --> 00:03:29,408
Sir..

2
00:04:15,597 --> 00:04:18,259
Susanna Anna Marie Johannes-

3
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:21,594
Prima facie, suicide

4
00:04:22,938 --> 00:04:25,771
She set ablaze not only
herself but her mansion too

5
00:04:26,908 --> 00:04:30,537
Married to 6 men, and
strangely all of them dead.

6
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:32,938
She must have been one hell of a lay

7
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:35,875
Well..

8
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:37,908
I'm sure you've seen
what we've recovered..

9
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:41,284
Skull, some bones,
ash, make up kit etc

10
00:04:42,424 --> 00:04:43,857
We need to carry out DNA profiling.

11
00:04:44,392 --> 00:04:46,656
Hope you're not too busy?

12
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:53,059
I'll do it.

13
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:54,427
It's a priority case

14
00:04:54,936 --> 00:04:56,927
and the police want to
ensure that she's dead.

15
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:41,741
Arun..

16
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,044
What are you doing?

17
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:00,023
How come you never
showed this to me?

18
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:02,360
Why?

19
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,766
Secret?

20
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:17,977
Is this 'the Susanna'?

21
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:22,320
''Saheb.'' [Master]

22
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:26,693
Now, she's no more.

23
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,467
Detached from life,
and torn apart by love..

24
00:06:39,841 --> 00:06:42,708
My ''Saheb'' was melancholic.

25
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:48,547
All her life, she was in
search for her eternal love.

26
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:54,479
She was very lonely.

27
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:59,320
Just an infant when
she lost her mother..

28
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,928
And before she could become
an adult, her father died.

29
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,857
My senior ''Saheb''. [Her father]

30
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,663
He was her everything!

31
00:07:09,237 --> 00:07:11,569
Friend, mother, and brother.

32
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,502
And after he was gone..

33
00:07:14,576 --> 00:07:18,740
.. she tried hard to find
him in every man she could.

34
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,450
On the day of her father's funeral..

35
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:34,519
.. in full black attire, she
reminded me of soft snow..

36
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:41,562
.. rolling off the
mountain in the silent night.

37
00:07:49,744 --> 00:07:51,769
No wonder she radiated in black.

38
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:57,476
And soon, it became her colour.

39
00:08:07,262 --> 00:08:08,354
Uncle Goonga!

40
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,892
Too much to say, but
unfortunately born dumb.

41
00:08:13,735 --> 00:08:15,327
I was born an orphan!

42
00:08:16,471 --> 00:08:21,932
Don't know if he
adopted me or I adopted him.

43
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,349
My first real competition.

44
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:30,942
And senior ''Saheb's'' last wish.

45
00:08:31,486 --> 00:08:32,680
The first husband..

46
00:08:32,987 --> 00:08:34,852
Major Edwin Rodriques.

47
00:08:38,793 --> 00:08:39,885
Goonga!

48
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:41,890
How much longer?

49
00:08:47,969 --> 00:08:49,027
Ghalib!

50
00:08:49,304 --> 00:08:50,498
What in the devil is he saying?

51
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,931
He says, everything should be
ready in the next half an hour.

52
00:08:59,614 --> 00:09:03,277
I don't want to see
any of his rats around.

53
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,816
Ghalib.

54
00:09:11,392 --> 00:09:15,988
Poet by name, butler by profession
and mocks a Bollywood villain.

55
00:09:26,374 --> 00:09:27,432
Anything else, sir?

56
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,538
What did he say?

57
00:09:32,647 --> 00:09:34,740
Thank you, sir!

58
00:09:45,393 --> 00:09:50,296
If he knew you were calling him
a fucker he'd pull your eyes out.

59
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,903
Ghalib!
- Sir!

60
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,746
The third ace in her trio.

61
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,315
Maggie aunty!

62
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:13,283
Under whose care ''Saheb'' grew up.

63
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:16,819
She became her mother
and her best friend.

64
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,951
She had a few other friends too.

65
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,729
Venomous, dangerous..

66
00:10:29,404 --> 00:10:31,872
.. but faithful like no other.

67
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,836
It's a Derby, darling!

68
00:10:37,946 --> 00:10:39,914
The jockey is as
important as the stallion.

69
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:44,919
I don't see any
reason for change, Rod.

70
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:48,349
Goonga was daddy's
favourite jockey.

71
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:55,687
What do you think, Martha?

72
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,491
I'm think someone here
may have a better idea.

73
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:00,329
Right, Tim?

74
00:11:01,469 --> 00:11:02,697
What do you have to say, Mr. Rangan?

75
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:06,806
Why don't we hire a
professional rider from abroad?

76
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:10,005
We can afford it and
I know one in Prague.

77
00:11:10,478 --> 00:11:13,038
Affordability was
never an issue, Mr. Rangan.

78
00:11:13,748 --> 00:11:15,511
Professional jockey from Prague..

79
00:11:16,751 --> 00:11:18,343
You boy

80
00:11:19,821 --> 00:11:20,913
What do you think you're doing?

81
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,352
Stealing!

82
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,052
Come here.

83
00:11:28,463 --> 00:11:29,555
Come on.

84
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,926
Show me your hands!

85
00:11:35,436 --> 00:11:36,528
Come on!

86
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,307
Whose rascal is this?

87
00:11:44,445 --> 00:11:47,539
I picked a few for Candy, Sir.

88
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:49,575
Who's Candy?

89
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:51,384
Your new horse.

90
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,077
That's a nice name for a horse.

91
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,317
Candy.

92
00:11:56,391 --> 00:11:59,019
He runs fast when he eat it Sir.

93
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:03,523
How much have you studied?

94
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,559
Seven and a half.

95
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,268
Anything else?

96
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:14,334
Yes, ''Saheb''. Candy loves you.

97
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:18,306
You tik-tok-tik-tok..

98
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:21,280
him in race, and win 'Dabry'!

99
00:12:58,753 --> 00:12:59,845
Miss ''Saheb'', forgive me!

100
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,255
Thought I'd help this orphan.

101
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,519
Will send this fool
back to the village.

102
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:09,822
You won't see this rat anymore.

103
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:19,031
You're right!

104
00:13:22,443 --> 00:13:23,933
He won't be seen here anymore.

105
00:13:27,381 --> 00:13:28,712
Because he'll be
starting school tomorrow.

106
00:13:35,723 --> 00:13:36,781
Okay.

107
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:40,953
Sugar.

108
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:44,429
''Saheb'', thank you!

109
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,387
Snap! My life
changed in a split second.

110
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:13,725
''Saheb'' picked me up
from a bed of thorns..

111
00:14:13,995 --> 00:14:15,519
and placed me on a bed of roses.

112
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,025
This is the new
admission I was talking about.

113
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,737
She was my goddess.

114
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,343
And I her blind devotee.

115
00:14:39,554 --> 00:14:42,853
All said and done Arun, the
Major was pretty handsome.

116
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,956
Quite a dashing fellow.

117
00:14:47,795 --> 00:14:50,696
The perfect Indian husband.

118
00:14:51,966 --> 00:14:58,337
Boring, possessive,
insecure and a doubting Thomas.

119
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,570
And a fart king too.

120
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:02,401
Mr. Stinker!

121
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,541
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention please.

122
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:12,753
Here's to our very own,
Major Edwin Rodriques.

123
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,813
The recipient of
the gallantry award.

124
00:15:16,724 --> 00:15:18,817
Cheers!
- Cheers!

125
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,494
We salute the bravery
and courage you displayed

126
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:26,394
all throughout operation Blue Star.

127
00:15:26,701 --> 00:15:30,694
It took a heavy toll on our brigade
and on your company in particular.

128
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,564
And my leg!

129
00:15:42,617 --> 00:15:43,845
Hey beautiful!

130
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:48,346
I can't figure out if you're
getting older or younger by the day.

131
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:52,452
Edwin is greying fast
but you look the same.

132
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,952
Thank you!

133
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:58,396
Here, for your
beautiful better half.

134
00:16:00,768 --> 00:16:01,826
She's quit drinking.

135
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,930
Really, since when?

136
00:16:04,705 --> 00:16:07,640
Today, I quit every morning.

137
00:16:08,376 --> 00:16:12,870
And that Brigadier Venkat, is
the secret of my beauty! Cheers!

138
00:16:13,447 --> 00:16:14,505
Cheers!

139
00:16:14,815 --> 00:16:16,544
Good evening, sir!
- Good evening.

140
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:18,509
May I have the pleasure of a dance..

141
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,283
.. with the lady..

142
00:16:24,892 --> 00:16:26,553
I always had two left feet.

143
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,487
Now I've lost one.

144
00:18:24,412 --> 00:18:25,845
Really!

145
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,310
You're quite the dancer, lieutenant.

146
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:32,248
Sir.

147
00:18:32,753 --> 00:18:36,951
But no match to your
beautiful half, sir.

148
00:18:40,895 --> 00:18:42,260
Beautiful half.

149
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,900
And the better one too.

150
00:18:56,777 --> 00:18:58,506
And she has a
beautiful name as well.

151
00:19:01,582 --> 00:19:02,776
Susanna.

152
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,447
What?

153
00:19:17,431 --> 00:19:18,489
Susanna.

154
00:19:27,408 --> 00:19:28,670
But you can call her..

155
00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:32,541
Mrs. Rodriques, if you please.

156
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,942
Thank you.

157
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:46,859
You know you can't
handle the fucking alcohol.

158
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,393
''I quit every morning.''

159
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:56,802
Stop fluttering around.

160
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,304
You're a married woman.

161
00:20:09,517 --> 00:20:12,418
Are you ashamed to be my wife?

162
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:19,525
Then why?

163
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:42,749
Why do you keep
reminding me of my disability?

164
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,946
I'm sorry.

165
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,634
It's high time we had a child.

166
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:19,981
Once you're a mother,
you'll learn wifely duties too.

167
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,471
Did you visit the gynaecologist?

168
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,783
All tests are normal.

169
00:21:55,756 --> 00:21:57,053
Then why can't you conceive?

170
00:22:04,298 --> 00:22:07,426
The doctor says, there's
nothing wrong with me.

171
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,344
So now..

172
00:22:22,816 --> 00:22:24,340
I'm disabled in bed too?

173
00:22:34,294 --> 00:22:38,594
''I've come from Alabama,
with a banjo on my knee.. ''

174
00:22:44,672 --> 00:22:49,837
''Oh Susanna! Won't
you cry for me.. ''

175
00:23:17,638 --> 00:23:23,543
How often have I told you
to knock before entering?

176
00:23:25,746 --> 00:23:27,737
Knock, knock!

177
00:23:35,823 --> 00:23:40,351
Next time, I'll bury you alive.

178
00:23:55,843 --> 00:23:57,868
This was bound to happen,
my friends!

179
00:23:58,846 --> 00:24:01,474
Marry in a haste and..

180
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,949
Repent at leisure.

181
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,390
You want to break his other leg?

182
00:24:16,964 --> 00:24:19,262
Don't fuck around with him.

183
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:22,627
At the end of the day,
you'll be the one to be fucked.

184
00:24:40,788 --> 00:24:43,348
Sir! Are you alright?

185
00:24:43,423 --> 00:24:44,515
You bastard!

186
00:24:50,397 --> 00:24:51,557
Son of a bitch.

187
00:25:07,681 --> 00:25:08,978
So you want to fight?

188
00:25:37,711 --> 00:25:39,542
Goonga.. Goonga..

189
00:25:39,613 --> 00:25:41,308
Goonga.. Goonga..

190
00:25:56,063 --> 00:25:59,760
Goonga.. Goonga..

191
00:26:11,745 --> 00:26:13,235
Goonga.. Goonga..

192
00:27:50,844 --> 00:27:51,970
Goonga.. what happened?

193
00:27:52,412 --> 00:27:53,470
What happened?

194
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:55,373
What happened?

195
00:27:57,851 --> 00:27:59,785
Ghalib.. Ghalib!

196
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,393
He will survive.

197
00:28:11,598 --> 00:28:13,793
But we're sorry, we
couldn't save his eye.

198
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,606
One eye is enough to
witness what's going to happen.

199
00:28:48,902 --> 00:28:51,666
The next time I saw the
Major for the last time.

200
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:56,671
Going in search of
the man-eating panther.

201
00:29:20,934 --> 00:29:22,731
Can I also have a drink tonight?

202
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:27,399
Just a drink?

203
00:29:29,242 --> 00:29:30,334
No.

204
00:29:31,545 --> 00:29:32,705
Minimum three.

205
00:29:33,847 --> 00:29:35,246
And you should be fun!

206
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:48,554
We must be very still, very quiet..

207
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,827
.. or the animal won't come.

208
00:29:55,635 --> 00:29:56,966
The beast in me is already here.

209
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:02,599
Major sir.

210
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:03,935
Major sir, panther.

211
00:30:39,613 --> 00:30:42,844
The panther wasn't
interested in the goat.

212
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,445
He was looking for humans.

213
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:50,448
Can't tell whether the
Major lost his balance..

214
00:30:51,691 --> 00:30:53,818
Or whether someone pushed him.

215
00:30:54,461 --> 00:30:55,655
Nevertheless..

216
00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:58,591
it took the forest officials
two days to find the Major..

217
00:30:58,665 --> 00:31:03,034
.. or whatever was left of him.

218
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:22,582
I just couldn't get
myself to mourn for the Major.

219
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:28,425
Had fate given me another chance..

220
00:31:28,495 --> 00:31:29,894
.. to woo my ''Saheb''?

221
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,765
Like a balloon my
hopes went soaring.

222
00:31:39,673 --> 00:31:44,303
But she chose the guitar instead.

223
00:32:54,414 --> 00:32:59,977
Indian women fall for a
guitarist over a riff.

224
00:33:00,654 --> 00:33:03,020
And this asshole had
the vocal chords too.

225
00:33:08,561 --> 00:33:12,588
Before the wedding this creature
was called Jamshed Singh Rathod.

226
00:33:13,566 --> 00:33:15,363
From now I'm Jimmy.

227
00:33:15,969 --> 00:33:17,334
Jimmy Stetson.

228
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:19,832
You can call me Jim.

229
00:33:21,308 --> 00:33:23,674
And you call me.. Susie.

230
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:26,370
Jim and Susie!

231
00:33:26,913 --> 00:33:28,005
Susie and Jim!

232
00:33:29,983 --> 00:33:33,749
Made for each other, that's right!

233
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,937
''Her lips were ripe and so close''

234
00:33:53,506 --> 00:33:54,996
''O Mama''

235
00:33:56,476 --> 00:33:58,603
''O Mama''

236
00:34:00,447 --> 00:34:05,578
''I looked at them and all but froze''

237
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:08,510
''O Mama''

238
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,649
''O Mama''

239
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,623
You wrote this for me?

240
00:34:17,297 --> 00:34:20,391
No, it sprung from within.

241
00:34:21,401 --> 00:34:22,629
My wedding gift to you.

242
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:46,053
''O Mama''

243
00:34:50,029 --> 00:34:52,657
''O Mama''

244
00:34:56,569 --> 00:34:59,470
''O Mama''

245
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:01,529
''O Mama''

246
00:35:03,843 --> 00:35:08,746
''My heart now only
thinks from the heart''

247
00:35:10,383 --> 00:35:12,681
''O Mama''

248
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,282
''O Mama''

249
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:22,250
''My heart often bangs my head''

250
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:26,397
''O Mama''

251
00:35:26,766 --> 00:35:29,963
''O Mama''

252
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,838
''No stranger to me''

253
00:35:33,573 --> 00:35:36,474
''May my fall be her rise''

254
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:43,042
''She, my nemesis, too,
is no stranger to me''

255
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:49,647
''A beating heart
forever stays beaten''

256
00:35:51,925 --> 00:35:54,621
''O Mama''

257
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,558
''O Mama''

258
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,462
''O Mama, she shoots at me''

259
00:36:01,835 --> 00:36:08,604
''this marble-eyed meow-like girl''

260
00:36:08,675 --> 00:36:11,007
''O Mama''

261
00:36:11,911 --> 00:36:15,711
''O Mama''

262
00:36:35,768 --> 00:36:40,728
''She steals on me, not
a sound she makes.. ''

263
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,805
''O Mama''

264
00:36:45,645 --> 00:36:51,481
''She smuggles herself into my
dreams, pray it doesn't stay a dream''

265
00:36:51,684 --> 00:36:54,812
''O Mama''

266
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:58,413
''There isn't hope''

267
00:36:58,725 --> 00:37:01,387
''But hope remains, still''

268
00:37:01,895 --> 00:37:07,925
''How I languish in
the anguish of love''

269
00:37:08,701 --> 00:37:14,367
''Something's being ripped out of me''

270
00:37:16,976 --> 00:37:19,376
''O Mama''

271
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,812
''O Mama''

272
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:26,676
''O Mama, she shoots at me''

273
00:37:26,986 --> 00:37:34,415
''this marble-eyed meow-like girl''

274
00:37:36,996 --> 00:37:39,692
''O Mama''

275
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:43,026
''O Mama''

276
00:37:43,436 --> 00:37:45,904
''O Mama''

277
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:51,341
Welcome back to
''Cultivation Today''..

278
00:37:58,051 --> 00:38:02,818
''She's taken on the reign,
this world is her's not mine.. ''

279
00:38:04,424 --> 00:38:06,483
''O Mama''

280
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,791
''O Mama''

281
00:38:11,297 --> 00:38:15,734
''How do I believe her love,
it's undefined''

282
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:19,395
''O Mama''

283
00:38:20,573 --> 00:38:21,835
''O Mama''

284
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:25,869
''Should've let the light inside''

285
00:38:26,412 --> 00:38:28,972
''For my heart and mind divide''

286
00:38:29,382 --> 00:38:34,547
''Have you lost me to her spell''

287
00:38:34,887 --> 00:38:37,856
''O Mama''

288
00:38:37,924 --> 00:38:39,289
''O Mama''

289
00:38:40,727 --> 00:38:41,853
''O Mama''

290
00:38:41,995 --> 00:38:43,257
''Won't you help me''

291
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:44,694
Okay that's enough!

292
00:38:45,832 --> 00:38:47,322
What's the proof this is yours?

293
00:38:49,268 --> 00:38:50,735
This was my college composition.

294
00:38:51,804 --> 00:38:54,534
Jamshed was the backup
vocalist in my band.

295
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:57,401
Bloody robber.

296
00:38:58,444 --> 00:38:59,809
Where the hell is he? Call him.

297
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:03,349
Here's proof.

298
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:08,285
It first came out in English, now
they're launching the holy version.

299
00:39:08,755 --> 00:39:12,782
''O Mother.. O Mother.. ''

300
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,328
Which record label?

301
00:39:19,332 --> 00:39:21,527
Now what?

302
00:39:22,468 --> 00:39:23,662
Respect.

303
00:39:28,675 --> 00:39:29,937
Shall we?

304
00:39:37,617 --> 00:39:40,643
Thanks man! Here's
a new composition.

305
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,317
Interested?

306
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:00,034
''At heart, the heart's just a heart''

307
00:40:00,306 --> 00:40:02,035
''At heart, the heart's just a heart''

308
00:40:06,012 --> 00:40:08,310
''At heart, the heart's just a heart''

309
00:40:08,381 --> 00:40:09,848
''At heart, the heart's just a heart''

310
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,274
''At heart, the heart's just a heart''

311
00:40:12,351 --> 00:40:13,716
''At heart, the heart's just a heart''

312
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:17,583
''Full of tricks and illusions,
Simply a smooth operator''

313
00:40:18,357 --> 00:40:21,622
''The heart's heady at
times and at times, take heart''

314
00:40:22,428 --> 00:40:25,522
''Full of tricks and illusions,
Simply a smooth operator''

315
00:40:26,399 --> 00:40:29,857
''The heart's heady at
times and at times, take heart''

316
00:40:30,703 --> 00:40:32,398
''It's just a gentle whisper,
at times and at times.. ''

317
00:40:32,705 --> 00:40:34,639
.. an uproarious drumroll''

318
00:40:34,707 --> 00:40:36,641
''At times, it's the raging fire
pulsating in your veins at times..''

319
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:39,735
''.. it is the calming coolness''

320
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,473
''Believe it or not''

321
00:40:44,617 --> 00:40:47,814
''Is only a matter of the heart''

322
00:40:48,387 --> 00:40:50,355
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

323
00:40:50,423 --> 00:40:51,913
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

324
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,891
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

325
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,723
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

326
00:40:55,928 --> 00:40:59,489
''The shore for drowning men''

327
00:40:59,966 --> 00:41:03,458
''The ignorance of the boor''

328
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,963
''A hundred heavens,
that's what it's worth''

329
00:41:06,272 --> 00:41:07,466
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

330
00:41:07,907 --> 00:41:09,738
Where are you, boss?

331
00:41:12,478 --> 00:41:14,446
The Berlin wall has collapsed..

332
00:41:16,616 --> 00:41:18,811
.. and so has the government.

333
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,950
And you're stuck on cocaine?

334
00:41:26,626 --> 00:41:29,720
This is what you call heroin!

335
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,932
No one has the balls to
behave in this manner.

336
00:41:35,468 --> 00:41:37,026
This is Bappi's song!

337
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:41,033
You know how many
musicians are waiting for him?

338
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:45,074
A hundred! Who is going to pay?

339
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:46,871
Your father?

340
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,941
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

341
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:53,044
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

342
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:54,581
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

343
00:41:55,354 --> 00:41:56,946
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

344
00:41:57,023 --> 00:41:58,615
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

345
00:41:58,925 --> 00:42:00,950
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

346
00:42:02,795 --> 00:42:06,925
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jimmy will be here soon.

347
00:42:07,466 --> 00:42:10,594
Please remain calm.
He will be here soon.

348
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,837
Please remain calm, please.

349
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:15,307
Please remain calm, please.

350
00:42:15,374 --> 00:42:16,671
In a few moments he will be here.

351
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,607
''A heart which beats.. ''

352
00:42:18,945 --> 00:42:20,913
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

353
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,607
''At heart, the heart's a heart''

354
00:42:29,021 --> 00:42:30,386
Yes, who is it.. ?

355
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:31,982
What do you want?

356
00:42:32,992 --> 00:42:34,323
Yes..

357
00:42:34,493 --> 00:42:35,892
I'm sorry.. Jimmy?

358
00:42:36,362 --> 00:42:37,454
Jimmy..

359
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,896
Jimmy boy, you've got a fan here.

360
00:42:42,001 --> 00:42:44,902
Got you.
- Bang you!

361
00:42:44,971 --> 00:42:46,962
Bang, bang, bang!

362
00:42:49,876 --> 00:42:51,503
FBI, dead! CBI, dead!

363
00:42:52,411 --> 00:42:56,074
Jimmy has the power!
- No, we are still alive.

364
00:42:57,049 --> 00:42:58,778
Jimmy is a cheater!

365
00:42:59,018 --> 00:43:00,645
Jimmy is a cheater!

366
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,754
Susie.. what are you doing here?

367
00:43:04,423 --> 00:43:05,515
Susie..

368
00:43:06,926 --> 00:43:08,018
When did you come?

369
00:43:09,262 --> 00:43:10,593
Why didn't you inform me?

370
00:43:12,732 --> 00:43:15,599
Susie, don't misunderstand.
They are just friends!

371
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,736
Just..
- Friends.

372
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,603
We were playing a game!

373
00:43:21,741 --> 00:43:22,799
Cops and robbers!

374
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:23,967
You wanna play?

375
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:25,736
Jimmy is a robber..

376
00:43:25,778 --> 00:43:27,268
Hey FBI cheater.

377
00:43:30,549 --> 00:43:32,676
Cops and robbers!

378
00:43:34,287 --> 00:43:35,584
Bang, bang, bang!

379
00:43:35,755 --> 00:43:37,450
Cops and robbers!

380
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:39,317
FBI, dead! CBI, dead!

381
00:43:41,427 --> 00:43:44,658
I got you. I got you.

382
00:43:47,733 --> 00:43:51,328
You die. You die. You die.

383
00:44:03,282 --> 00:44:05,546
This time she was determined..

384
00:44:06,385 --> 00:44:07,943
.. to save her marriage.

385
00:44:08,821 --> 00:44:12,257
This time she wouldn't give up.

386
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,928
Susie, remember..

387
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:21,860
It's Jim.

388
00:44:22,935 --> 00:44:24,266
Your Jim.

389
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,402
Why are you doing this to me?

390
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,769
I won't go back to drugs!

391
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,507
I swear.

392
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:40,944
Please, Susie!

393
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:47,651
You bitch!

394
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,326
I will choke you to
death once I'm free.

395
00:44:50,596 --> 00:44:52,723
You are messing with
Jamshed Singh Rathod.

396
00:44:53,332 --> 00:44:54,526
I am of royal blood.

397
00:44:54,934 --> 00:44:57,835
I will cut you into tiny
pieces and feed you to the dogs.

398
00:44:58,337 --> 00:44:59,429
You bitch!

399
00:45:05,344 --> 00:45:06,436
Susie..

400
00:45:08,848 --> 00:45:11,749
I can recommend a good
rehab facility in Bangalore..

401
00:45:12,351 --> 00:45:14,945
.. very private, excellent one.

402
00:45:17,623 --> 00:45:18,681
No, doctor.

403
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,518
I can't leave him alone.

404
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:29,964
He is my life.

405
00:45:30,536 --> 00:45:33,471
By now Saheb's
life began to settle..

406
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,672
Jimmy was getting better.

407
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,801
But she didn't realise
that drugs addicts..

408
00:45:40,046 --> 00:45:41,707
.. become sly once they're caught.

409
00:45:42,515 --> 00:45:44,039
'Champions of deception.'

410
00:45:46,552 --> 00:45:47,644
Sir..

411
00:45:51,424 --> 00:45:52,550
Madame.

412
00:45:54,326 --> 00:45:58,319
This was confiscated from
a drug peddler yesterday.

413
00:46:02,501 --> 00:46:08,838
Who else could own
such a beautiful piece?

414
00:46:09,408 --> 00:46:10,966
I knew, as soon as
I laid eyes on it!

415
00:46:11,944 --> 00:46:15,607
It's priceless too.. how much?

416
00:46:18,751 --> 00:46:21,777
You never put a price on
priceless things, Inspector.

417
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,448
''Keemat.'' [Price]

418
00:46:24,757 --> 00:46:26,315
Inspector Keemat Lal.

419
00:46:35,901 --> 00:46:38,028
Muzzle loader NX 6.

420
00:46:42,575 --> 00:46:44,873
Amongst the first guns
to be brought to India..

421
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:47,504
.. by the soldiers
of the British rule.

422
00:46:52,651 --> 00:46:54,778
Was a favourite in my
father's antique collection.

423
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:58,953
I'd like to question your servants.

424
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,552
A marble-eyed meow-like girl..

425
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:06,761
O doggy..

426
00:47:07,466 --> 00:47:11,232
Our servants are
more loyal than owners.

427
00:47:12,304 --> 00:47:13,362
Madame..

428
00:47:15,774 --> 00:47:16,900
Thank you.

429
00:47:17,276 --> 00:47:18,368
Madame.

430
00:47:20,279 --> 00:47:23,476
You can call me by my name,
if you please..

431
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,643
Susanna.

432
00:47:27,853 --> 00:47:31,789
How dare I.. Madame.

433
00:47:31,924 --> 00:47:34,324
Thank you. Nevertheless..

434
00:47:34,593 --> 00:47:39,860
I don't think I would ever..
maybe another time.

435
00:47:40,332 --> 00:47:44,792
Right now.. it's not appropriate.

436
00:49:52,464 --> 00:49:53,522
Jim..

437
00:50:19,825 --> 00:50:20,917
Careful, sir!

438
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,455
These snakes are venomous.

439
00:50:24,863 --> 00:50:26,660
The snake temple.

440
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,660
Snake temple?

441
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:33,665
But, Madame is a Christian.

442
00:50:35,808 --> 00:50:36,866
Yes, she is!

443
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:40,604
Her father was a Christian,
but mother, a Hindu.

444
00:50:41,347 --> 00:50:42,678
She set it up.

445
00:50:43,349 --> 00:50:45,613
Saheb feeds them milk,
every morning without fail!

446
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:47,848
How?
- She goes down.

447
00:50:48,854 --> 00:50:50,481
Isn't she scared?

448
00:50:50,622 --> 00:50:52,351
No! They're her pets.

449
00:50:52,858 --> 00:50:57,955
She thinks humans
are more poisonous.

450
00:51:01,533 --> 00:51:02,625
Wow!

451
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:06,633
That's great.

452
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:08,868
Sir, snake!

453
00:51:10,542 --> 00:51:11,975
Are you alright, sir?
- Yes, I'm fine.

454
00:51:29,395 --> 00:51:33,388
One, two, three, four, five, six..

455
00:51:35,334 --> 00:51:38,929
Six, five, four, three, two, one..

456
00:51:40,339 --> 00:51:41,738
Whose footprint is this?

457
00:51:42,841 --> 00:51:44,035
Could be anyone's..

458
00:51:45,711 --> 00:51:46,905
Notjust anyone..

459
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,672
It belongs to the murderer.

460
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,407
Murderer?

461
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:22,513
Is anyone left?
- Yes, there is.

462
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,482
Who is it?

463
00:52:35,627 --> 00:52:36,719
It's me.

464
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:53,875
Why do you bother, Madame.

465
00:52:54,313 --> 00:52:56,907
You've gotten your feet all muddy!

466
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:58,576
There is no need, Madame.

467
00:52:59,952 --> 00:53:02,443
Not Madame, Susanna.

468
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:09,520
You are just.. I mean.. how will I..

469
00:53:10,696 --> 00:53:13,722
Really.. I mean.. I mean..

470
00:53:15,634 --> 00:53:16,760
Joking!

471
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:21,635
Not right. Who am I to say!

472
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:25,672
Just as you wish.. the next time.

473
00:53:26,678 --> 00:53:32,275
But it's fine.. not a bad thing.

474
00:53:32,885 --> 00:53:33,943
I'll try next time.

475
00:53:35,888 --> 00:53:36,980
But how will I?

476
00:53:38,957 --> 00:53:44,725
It is believed that Jesus
spent his last days in Kashmir.

477
00:53:45,697 --> 00:53:48,928
''Saheb'' left for Kashmir
in search of the Lord..

478
00:53:49,801 --> 00:53:53,601
Instead of Jesus,
she met ''Mohammed''.

479
00:53:53,805 --> 00:53:55,830
Hail Allah!

480
00:53:55,908 --> 00:53:57,603
Hail Allah!

481
00:53:57,709 --> 00:53:59,939
Mohammed Wasiullah Khan.

482
00:54:00,412 --> 00:54:01,606
A.K. A The Traveller.

483
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:05,409
From the soot of
spiraling everyday smoke..

484
00:54:06,251 --> 00:54:08,811
.. a patch of sky,
now remains blackened..

485
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,389
.. all day long.

486
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:14,550
Great!
- Wonderful!

487
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:20,760
Do not bow your head beneath it..

488
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:26,404
.. for now when you prostrate,
God yanks His feet away.

489
00:54:32,444 --> 00:54:34,844
In the mounds of rotting rubbish..

490
00:54:35,614 --> 00:54:37,878
.. heads of bodies
gone cold still smoulder.

491
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:40,282
Wonderful! Wonderful!

492
00:54:40,419 --> 00:54:45,379
Hungry four legged animals, fight
over the bones of arms and legs.

493
00:54:46,558 --> 00:54:48,992
The flesh and the bone
belongs to the one..

494
00:54:49,361 --> 00:54:51,352
.. who first digs its
teeth into the flesh.

495
00:54:53,365 --> 00:54:55,424
May I proceed?
- Yes, please.

496
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,799
The flesh and the bone
belongs to the one..

497
00:54:59,404 --> 00:55:01,497
.. who first digs its
teeth into the flesh.

498
00:55:01,773 --> 00:55:06,005
The men of faith now ask, who
first dug his spade into this earth!

499
00:55:06,278 --> 00:55:09,907
Wow!
- Wonderful! - Wonderful!

500
00:55:10,248 --> 00:55:14,344
The men of faith now ask, who
first dug his spade into this earth!

501
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:16,612
Some say there was
a mosque here once.

502
00:55:16,755 --> 00:55:18,655
Some say no, once a
temple stood here.

503
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:21,523
Wow! Wow!
- Wonderful!

504
00:55:23,996 --> 00:55:26,430
But when you touch your
forehead to the ground..

505
00:55:26,498 --> 00:55:30,798
God yanks His feet away now.

506
00:55:32,404 --> 00:55:35,271
He cannot bring Himself to believe..

507
00:55:36,608 --> 00:55:39,338
He cannot bring Himself to believe..

508
00:55:39,478 --> 00:55:42,777
.. that He once called
this place, His home.

509
00:55:42,848 --> 00:55:44,315
Wow!
- Wow!

510
00:55:45,517 --> 00:55:47,007
This time, ''Saheb'' not
only had a new lover..

511
00:55:47,953 --> 00:55:51,980
.. but also a new name and religion.

512
00:55:54,026 --> 00:55:56,620
Susanna Anna Marie
Johannes was now..

513
00:55:56,862 --> 00:55:59,490
Sultana Wasiullah Khan.

514
00:55:59,931 --> 00:56:01,057
Thank you.

515
00:56:01,366 --> 00:56:03,596
Wow!
- Wow! - Great!

516
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:04,861
- One more, please!

517
00:56:04,936 --> 00:56:06,836
Don't go!

518
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:10,534
One more verse!

519
00:56:21,019 --> 00:56:23,715
My next verse..
- Yes, please.

520
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,915
A day shall dawn..

521
00:56:29,828 --> 00:56:31,523
.. bringing with it a calm..

522
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:36,595
.. the heart bereft of desires,
the mind devoid of passion..

523
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:43,472
''Shoreless, totally fathomless''

524
00:56:45,811 --> 00:56:48,803
''Close your eyes, please''

525
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:54,582
''I have been drowning''

526
00:56:56,488 --> 00:56:59,457
''I need to breathe''

527
00:57:01,727 --> 00:57:06,926
''Shoreless, totally fathomless,
Close your eyes, please''

528
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:12,669
''I have been drowning,
I need to breathe''

529
00:57:13,271 --> 00:57:15,364
''Lillah!''

530
00:57:15,774 --> 00:57:21,303
''Turn your face away from me''

531
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:26,345
''It'll be a great kindness''

532
00:57:26,585 --> 00:57:31,852
''Turn your face away from me''

533
00:57:32,457 --> 00:57:36,655
''It'll be a great kindness''

534
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:43,757
''Ever since I have seen you''

535
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:47,771
''My breath's stuck''

536
00:57:47,906 --> 00:57:54,402
''Ever since I have seen you''

537
00:57:54,579 --> 00:57:59,278
''My breath's stuck''

538
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:02,650
''Shoreless, totally fathomless''

539
00:58:04,489 --> 00:58:08,357
''Close your eyes, please''

540
00:58:09,761 --> 00:58:14,289
''I have been drowning''

541
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,733
''I need to breathe''

542
00:58:21,273 --> 00:58:22,831
May I?
- Proceed.

543
00:58:24,776 --> 00:58:28,712
If a flitting glance of yours,
were to graze me

544
00:58:29,681 --> 00:58:30,943
That would be greeting enough..

545
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:34,314
.. and I'll keep my
eyes forever lowered.

546
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,251
Wow!

547
00:58:37,756 --> 00:58:41,590
Ever since I have seen you

548
00:58:41,993 --> 00:58:43,290
My breath is..

549
00:58:46,965 --> 00:58:49,433
Stuck!
- Brilliant!

550
00:58:49,601 --> 00:58:51,592
Mukarrar!

551
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:52,762
Who is that?

552
00:58:54,873 --> 00:58:55,931
Your uncle!

553
00:58:56,007 --> 00:59:00,341
''Pray, take a look''

554
00:59:01,313 --> 00:59:05,340
''At your feet''

555
00:59:06,618 --> 00:59:10,611
''Something's stuck, it seems''

556
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:16,318
''Please ask Time to move on''

557
00:59:17,329 --> 00:59:21,288
''If a flitting glance of yours''

558
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:27,402
''Were to graze me''

559
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:31,570
''That would be greeting enough..''

560
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:36,813
''.. And I'll keep my
eyes forever lowered''

561
00:59:36,882 --> 00:59:38,713
''At your feet''

562
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:45,279
''Ever since I have seen you''

563
00:59:45,523 --> 00:59:50,984
''My breath's stuck''

564
00:59:51,429 --> 00:59:53,829
''Shoreless, totally fathomless''

565
00:59:53,999 --> 00:59:56,593
''Close your eyes, please''

566
00:59:56,735 --> 00:59:59,260
''I have been drowning''

567
00:59:59,437 --> 01:00:02,372
''I need to breathe''

568
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:04,740
''Lillah!''

569
01:00:23,762 --> 01:00:27,823
Tender and romantic in his poetry..

570
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,994
.. bastard in bed.

571
01:00:37,042 --> 01:00:40,808
Unless he beat the
shit out of the woman..

572
01:00:41,046 --> 01:00:42,707
he remained impotent.

573
01:00:58,997 --> 01:01:00,328
Come on..

574
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,468
Come on, bit me.

575
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,338
Come on, bit me.

576
01:01:12,444 --> 01:01:14,275
I like it.

577
01:01:18,016 --> 01:01:19,415
It's great fun.

578
01:02:11,369 --> 01:02:15,965
Initially she tried hard
to conceal her scars..

579
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:20,408
.. but her wounds grew deeper.

580
01:02:22,047 --> 01:02:25,483
Love became a myth.

581
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:27,543
Like a mirage.

582
01:02:28,386 --> 01:02:32,482
You think it's there,
but it really isn't.

583
01:02:33,725 --> 01:02:37,821
Prayers, offerings and sacrifices,
she tried it all.

584
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:39,863
But nothing worked.

585
01:04:17,829 --> 01:04:21,321
Is it coming from
the heart or the being?

586
01:05:06,978 --> 01:05:09,879
These fumes, from
where do they come?

587
01:05:49,921 --> 01:05:53,516
Love is a heavy stone..

588
01:05:57,395 --> 01:06:00,023
Not for the weak ones.

589
01:06:05,403 --> 01:06:06,597
What does 'Natawan' mean?

590
01:06:25,456 --> 01:06:26,616
''Debilitated.''

591
01:06:33,398 --> 01:06:34,490
Weak..

592
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:45,634
Feeble.

593
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,532
Sultana!

594
01:07:57,515 --> 01:07:58,948
Sultana!

595
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:04,247
Cold-blooded!

596
01:09:05,716 --> 01:09:06,876
Why kill someone?

597
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,914
She could've left him and come home.

598
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:13,648
Who would've stopped her?

599
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:18,224
As a child, Miss
''Saheb'' would walk to school.

600
01:09:19,497 --> 01:09:20,930
There were two paths.

601
01:09:21,999 --> 01:09:23,364
Both equidistant.

602
01:09:24,669 --> 01:09:26,762
No difference at all.

603
01:09:28,773 --> 01:09:33,972
And one day, there came a crazy dog,

604
01:09:35,513 --> 01:09:37,378
Who scared her every single day.

605
01:09:51,762 --> 01:09:54,253
She could've taken the other path.

606
01:09:56,601 --> 01:10:02,562
She hid her father's
Mouser in her bag..

607
01:10:03,374 --> 01:10:05,342
And bang!

608
01:10:09,514 --> 01:10:13,848
''Saheb'' always gets her way..

609
01:10:15,386 --> 01:10:18,981
And the dogs are blown off!

610
01:11:03,448 --> 01:11:06,884
Ladies and gentlemen,
to present the trophy..

611
01:11:07,452 --> 01:11:12,014
may I now call on stage, our
esteemed guest of honour..

612
01:11:12,357 --> 01:11:14,689
Mr. Nikolai Vronsky.

613
01:11:14,759 --> 01:11:18,718
Science-attachÃ© to the
Russian consulate, Sir.

614
01:11:23,935 --> 01:11:25,368
Thank you, sir.

615
01:11:27,739 --> 01:11:29,366
Greetings!

616
01:11:30,475 --> 01:11:35,538
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to
handover this wonderful trophy..

617
01:11:35,747 --> 01:11:38,307
to the winner, but before I do so..

618
01:11:39,384 --> 01:11:41,682
I really would like to
share something with you.

619
01:11:42,353 --> 01:11:44,844
I did bet on this particular horse..

620
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:47,351
and I won a fortune.

621
01:11:51,896 --> 01:11:53,989
I need to say thank you very much.

622
01:11:55,967 --> 01:11:58,026
I'm grateful to you.

623
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:00,701
I am Vronsky..

624
01:12:00,905 --> 01:12:02,395
Nikolai Vronsky.

625
01:12:02,707 --> 01:12:04,402
Then I must be Anna!

626
01:12:08,946 --> 01:12:11,471
Anna Karenina is my
favorite character.

627
01:12:12,350 --> 01:12:15,945
I've read the novel, I
don't know.. so many times.

628
01:12:16,788 --> 01:12:19,985
In Hindi.. please.

629
01:12:20,992 --> 01:12:22,687
I'm learning the language.

630
01:12:29,667 --> 01:12:34,434
What else have you picked up?

631
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,564
Okay!

632
01:12:43,047 --> 01:12:48,041
My love for you is eternal.

633
01:12:52,690 --> 01:12:53,884
Let's go, Saheb.

634
01:12:54,759 --> 01:12:58,695
Mr. Vronsky, have you
met my pal here, Arun.

635
01:12:58,963 --> 01:13:01,659
- Is that your full name?
- Yes! Arun.. Arun Kumar.

636
01:13:03,701 --> 01:13:04,793
Anna..

637
01:13:04,869 --> 01:13:06,427
- Anna? - Hold on!

638
01:13:10,741 --> 01:13:16,839
Please have dinner with me..

639
01:13:17,315 --> 01:13:19,715
.. at a nice restaurant today.

640
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:23,987
I am very rich.

641
01:13:26,724 --> 01:13:28,385
I'm sorry, what?

642
01:13:30,361 --> 01:13:31,658
I mean to say that..

643
01:13:31,696 --> 01:13:34,358
I really would like to
spend this play money on..

644
01:13:35,299 --> 01:13:37,597
.. a nice dinner, somewhere?

645
01:13:38,302 --> 01:13:39,894
Would you please do it to me?

646
01:13:42,473 --> 01:13:45,806
I'm sorry, Mr. Vronsky, I
have a prior engagement.

647
01:13:48,412 --> 01:13:50,903
I do definitely understand that,
but can I at least..

648
01:13:50,982 --> 01:13:52,313
Anna!

649
01:13:56,687 --> 01:14:01,351
Can I at least drop
you to.. your mansion?

650
01:14:01,926 --> 01:14:03,052
Please!

651
01:14:03,728 --> 01:14:07,425
I have my car.

652
01:14:10,668 --> 01:14:12,829
But I have
something better, a mother.

653
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:19,007
Amitabh Bachchan.
From the movie, Deewar.

654
01:14:20,011 --> 01:14:21,478
It's destiny.

655
01:14:22,246 --> 01:14:23,372
What?

656
01:15:02,019 --> 01:15:03,486
From now on..

657
01:15:04,355 --> 01:15:07,654
no English, no Campa Cola.

658
01:15:07,959 --> 01:15:11,486
Only Russian and Vodka.

659
01:15:14,899 --> 01:15:18,892
Russia and me.. why?

660
01:15:19,737 --> 01:15:23,537
Because you my friend,
are headed to Russia.

661
01:15:23,874 --> 01:15:27,366
To study at St.
Petersburg Medical Academy.

662
01:15:27,445 --> 01:15:29,777
Cheers!

663
01:15:31,515 --> 01:15:32,675
Why?

664
01:15:35,686 --> 01:15:38,883
Because, Nik loves me..

665
01:15:39,724 --> 01:15:42,784
and I love you, my little sugar.

666
01:15:51,268 --> 01:15:52,394
Nik!

667
01:15:54,705 --> 01:15:56,639
To hell I'm going to Russia!

668
01:15:59,744 --> 01:16:00,870
Why not?

669
01:16:02,446 --> 01:16:05,381
Because, I hate vodka.

670
01:16:11,055 --> 01:16:12,886
It's because..

671
01:16:15,559 --> 01:16:18,790
.. you are jealous of the Russians.

672
01:16:59,704 --> 01:17:02,798
Quiet a distance he has walked

673
01:17:03,607 --> 01:17:06,599
A thousand distant miles

674
01:17:07,344 --> 01:17:13,749
Another Pushkin from Russia

675
01:17:14,752 --> 01:17:20,952
Who's left Moscow only
to be with me

676
01:17:21,726 --> 01:17:27,995
Something like this is
possible only in love

677
01:17:28,265 --> 01:17:30,290
Darling

678
01:17:30,468 --> 01:17:33,494
Let your eyes feast on mine

679
01:17:33,571 --> 01:17:37,405
Darling let the passion rush

680
01:17:37,475 --> 01:17:41,343
Don't hold it back
let this love gush

681
01:17:41,412 --> 01:17:45,246
Darling let your eyes feast on mine

682
01:17:45,316 --> 01:17:49,275
Don't hold it back
let this love gush

683
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:51,354
The Spring's joyless

684
01:17:51,422 --> 01:17:52,946
The beloved's heart's restless

685
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:56,789
Hold back the songbirds

686
01:17:56,861 --> 01:18:01,298
Darling let your eyes feast on mine

687
01:18:18,816 --> 01:18:19,976
Anna?

688
01:18:21,318 --> 01:18:28,247
That hillock enveloped in mist

689
01:18:28,459 --> 01:18:35,262
Where the fairies once lived

690
01:18:35,733 --> 01:18:42,571
You'll find it
across the high Khyber

691
01:18:42,907 --> 01:18:49,471
That's what all
the fairies still say

692
01:18:49,547 --> 01:18:51,572
Darling

693
01:18:51,649 --> 01:18:55,676
I'm merely a serf, let
me groom the Princess

694
01:18:55,753 --> 01:18:59,655
Let this restless
heart steal a little solace

695
01:18:59,723 --> 01:19:03,523
Let me conquer the
heart of my beloved

696
01:19:03,594 --> 01:19:07,655
Darling let your eyes feast on mine

697
01:19:07,698 --> 01:19:09,598
The Spring's joyless

698
01:19:09,667 --> 01:19:11,396
The beloved's heart's restless

699
01:19:11,468 --> 01:19:15,268
Hold back the songbirds

700
01:19:15,339 --> 01:19:18,968
Darling let your eyes feast on mine

701
01:19:19,043 --> 01:19:22,672
Don't hold it back
let this love gush

702
01:19:22,746 --> 01:19:26,238
Darling let your eyes feast on mine

703
01:19:26,317 --> 01:19:29,548
Don't hold it back
let this love gush

704
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:33,886
Darling let your eyes feast on mine

705
01:20:20,738 --> 01:20:22,000
Honey..

706
01:20:22,973 --> 01:20:24,531
Good evening, darling!

707
01:20:24,909 --> 01:20:26,774
Did you have to leave
all the guests alone..

708
01:20:27,411 --> 01:20:28,673
by themselves?

709
01:20:31,048 --> 01:20:32,572
Come on back in.

710
01:20:33,984 --> 01:20:35,975
Who were you talking to, Nik?

711
01:20:37,922 --> 01:20:41,289
A colleague, from Moscow.

712
01:20:43,861 --> 01:20:45,385
Woman?

713
01:20:48,332 --> 01:20:50,061
Oh you're so jealous!

714
01:20:50,734 --> 01:20:52,668
Look at me. So jealous!

715
01:20:54,405 --> 01:20:55,736
What do you think?

716
01:20:59,376 --> 01:21:02,504
Your last words of the
conversation meant..

717
01:21:03,647 --> 01:21:06,480
'Darling, I will be back soon.'

718
01:21:12,556 --> 01:21:14,649
Your Russian is so bad.

719
01:21:17,528 --> 01:21:20,429
Shall we just go in,
please? Come on.

720
01:21:21,832 --> 01:21:23,993
You are hiding
something from me, Nik.

721
01:21:25,636 --> 01:21:26,796
No!

722
01:21:27,771 --> 01:21:29,033
Sure?

723
01:21:32,309 --> 01:21:33,503
No.

724
01:21:37,681 --> 01:21:43,483
When I say I go to Kanyakumari..

725
01:21:47,358 --> 01:21:51,761
I don't go to Kanyakumari.

726
01:21:55,766 --> 01:21:58,428
I go to Koodankulam, instead.

727
01:22:03,741 --> 01:22:04,867
Koodankulam?

728
01:22:06,910 --> 01:22:08,036
Yes, Koodankulam.

729
01:22:11,515 --> 01:22:13,710
Koodankulam Nuclear Power project.

730
01:22:16,954 --> 01:22:20,446
Honey, we're helping
your government to..

731
01:22:21,425 --> 01:22:24,588
set up the light water
reactor technology in India.

732
01:22:28,766 --> 01:22:29,824
Excuse me?

733
01:22:32,803 --> 01:22:33,861
What's that supposed to mean?

734
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:42,776
It means your country, is going to
become one of the self sufficient..

735
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,045
nuclear states.

736
01:22:47,851 --> 01:22:49,045
Nik.

737
01:22:52,556 --> 01:22:53,853
You are a spy?

738
01:22:55,959 --> 01:22:57,051
Come on!

739
01:23:03,967 --> 01:23:05,434
No.

740
01:23:10,707 --> 01:23:11,765
No!

741
01:23:14,878 --> 01:23:16,311
I am your friend.

742
01:23:17,714 --> 01:23:18,942
And..

743
01:23:21,618 --> 01:23:25,782
my love for you is eternal.

744
01:23:36,834 --> 01:23:38,301
A kilo of this, please.

745
01:23:39,603 --> 01:23:41,969
I'm just not ready
for another marriage.

746
01:23:46,410 --> 01:23:47,468
Why not?

747
01:23:48,879 --> 01:23:52,610
Marriage is the worst
thing that happened to mankind.

748
01:23:54,852 --> 01:23:56,547
And in any case..

749
01:23:56,620 --> 01:24:00,613
I want to remain in love, you know.

750
01:24:02,359 --> 01:24:03,485
Me too.

751
01:24:04,995 --> 01:24:06,553
But you know I..

752
01:24:09,466 --> 01:24:11,457
I can't stay for long with you.

753
01:24:15,672 --> 01:24:17,299
Unless I marry you.

754
01:24:19,510 --> 01:24:22,911
Why? Marriage why?

755
01:24:23,981 --> 01:24:25,505
Because..

756
01:24:27,284 --> 01:24:32,312
I'm pregnant..

757
01:24:33,423 --> 01:24:36,017
.. with your child.

758
01:24:38,495 --> 01:24:39,655
A shocking incident..

759
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:42,358
India had finally
accomplished its nuclear test.

760
01:24:43,867 --> 01:24:46,495
And instead of Hiroshima,
it was now, my heart!

761
01:24:48,438 --> 01:24:50,838
Saheb dropped two bombs.

762
01:24:51,375 --> 01:24:53,275
First.. to get married!

763
01:24:57,748 --> 01:25:00,615
The other, to send me to Russia.

764
01:25:28,278 --> 01:25:30,439
It was my fault.

765
01:25:31,848 --> 01:25:34,282
I should've kept mum.

766
01:25:36,353 --> 01:25:38,787
I made a trip to Moscow to
attend a college seminar.

767
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:42,754
And what I saw there..

768
01:25:43,427 --> 01:25:45,691
blew my mind.

769
01:25:49,866 --> 01:25:53,324
Nikolai Vronsky, in fact had..

770
01:25:53,403 --> 01:25:54,700
two Anna's.

771
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:59,636
One in India and
the other in Moscow.

772
01:26:03,313 --> 01:26:06,612
I still blame myself for his death.

773
01:26:07,484 --> 01:26:09,975
I shouldn't have
sent her those pictures.

774
01:26:15,993 --> 01:26:17,460
Hi guys!

775
01:26:17,561 --> 01:26:19,028
So great to be back.

776
01:26:20,731 --> 01:26:21,755
Where's Anna?

777
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:27,294
She's at the market.

778
01:26:27,771 --> 01:26:30,365
- But why? - For
her new wedding gown.

779
01:26:45,822 --> 01:26:47,687
Goonga! Greatjob.

780
01:26:48,659 --> 01:26:49,956
Lovely!

781
01:26:51,261 --> 01:26:52,694
Feels so good.

782
01:26:54,331 --> 01:26:56,390
The late Major..

783
01:26:57,968 --> 01:26:59,401
her first husband.

784
01:27:01,772 --> 01:27:03,296
Very brave, sir!

785
01:27:05,375 --> 01:27:08,867
He was eaten by a panther,
wasn't he?

786
01:27:11,982 --> 01:27:13,472
Shut up Goonga!

787
01:27:14,985 --> 01:27:16,282
What did he say?

788
01:27:16,353 --> 01:27:18,821
He says we pushed the Major down..

789
01:27:19,623 --> 01:27:20,749
and then the panther ate him.

790
01:27:23,927 --> 01:27:26,327
Don't believe him, sir.

791
01:27:26,596 --> 01:27:28,496
He is a big liar.

792
01:27:30,767 --> 01:27:33,827
Husband number two, Jimmy.

793
01:27:34,671 --> 01:27:36,229
Very good song, sir!

794
01:27:44,881 --> 01:27:46,348
Goonga, shut the hell up.

795
01:27:47,918 --> 01:27:50,546
Why are you telling me all this?

796
01:27:50,754 --> 01:27:53,279
Because he too, had a mother.

797
01:27:53,523 --> 01:27:55,286
No, not at all.

798
01:27:55,759 --> 01:27:58,523
Don't believe them,
they are just lying!

799
01:27:59,563 --> 01:28:06,366
They say, that we gave
him an overdose of heroin..

800
01:28:08,672 --> 01:28:12,039
then we dragged him to the cemetery.

801
01:28:17,547 --> 01:28:19,481
Husband number three..

802
01:28:20,751 --> 01:28:25,313
Wasiullah Khan a.k. a The Traveller!

803
01:28:25,722 --> 01:28:27,986
We dug his grave in the snow..

804
01:28:28,792 --> 01:28:32,523
and buried him alive.

805
01:28:39,870 --> 01:28:41,701
Good sense of humour guys!

806
01:28:45,942 --> 01:28:47,375
Where is Anna?

807
01:28:51,415 --> 01:28:53,940
Anna is over here!

808
01:28:54,584 --> 01:28:55,778
Look!

809
01:28:55,852 --> 01:28:58,377
Anna's here!

810
01:29:00,724 --> 01:29:03,887
And that is you..

811
01:29:04,728 --> 01:29:06,992
Nikolai Vronsky!

812
01:29:07,697 --> 01:29:11,929
My husband number four..

813
01:29:12,769 --> 01:29:16,603
with his wife number two.

814
01:29:18,375 --> 01:29:20,900
Cheers to that!

815
01:29:20,977 --> 01:29:27,405
Four, four..

816
01:29:27,484 --> 01:29:29,213
Where the hell did
you get this from?

817
01:29:30,353 --> 01:29:31,513
R. A. W.

818
01:29:31,588 --> 01:29:33,488
I'm asking you, who gave it to you!

819
01:29:33,723 --> 01:29:37,819
R. A. W..

820
01:29:37,894 --> 01:29:41,853
Anna, I was on a mission,
we were following a CIA man.

821
01:29:45,702 --> 01:29:46,964
It's part of my job.

822
01:29:47,471 --> 01:29:49,701
- It's part of my job,
you understand? - What!

823
01:29:49,773 --> 01:29:52,674
To have a wife in every country?

824
01:29:53,477 --> 01:29:55,809
A wife in every country!

825
01:29:55,879 --> 01:29:59,246
Darling let your eyes feast on mine

826
01:29:59,316 --> 01:30:00,840
Darling let your eyes feast on mine

827
01:30:00,884 --> 01:30:02,476
Give it to me, it's mine.

828
01:30:03,687 --> 01:30:04,847
Just give it to me.

829
01:30:05,589 --> 01:30:07,887
Run away! Run fast..

830
01:30:11,795 --> 01:30:13,387
He ran away!

831
01:30:15,899 --> 01:30:17,423
It's a mad house!

832
01:30:17,501 --> 01:30:19,025
It's a mad house, you know!

833
01:30:19,569 --> 01:30:20,831
You're crazy!

834
01:30:21,438 --> 01:30:22,598
Come on, honey.

835
01:30:22,873 --> 01:30:24,340
Come on, listen to me.

836
01:30:24,608 --> 01:30:25,973
She is not my wife.

837
01:30:27,677 --> 01:30:28,905
She is my colleague..

838
01:30:29,813 --> 01:30:31,007
.. an agent.

839
01:30:32,682 --> 01:30:36,049
And you.. a double agent!

840
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:40,556
Believe me.. we were just
acting like husband and wife.

841
01:30:42,959 --> 01:30:47,987
I know you can play
a very good husband!

842
01:30:52,602 --> 01:30:56,629
But to play such a great daddy.

843
01:30:58,642 --> 01:31:00,371
No chance!

844
01:31:05,682 --> 01:31:07,445
You're so wrong, Anna.

845
01:31:08,518 --> 01:31:09,746
You're so wrong.

846
01:31:18,728 --> 01:31:20,025
Always!

847
01:31:45,021 --> 01:31:46,716
I'll quit the job, honey.

848
01:31:47,791 --> 01:31:49,383
And I'll be back for you.

849
01:31:51,394 --> 01:31:52,656
Forever!

850
01:31:57,867 --> 01:31:59,892
My love for you is eternal.

851
01:32:25,629 --> 01:32:27,790
Come on, you've been called.

852
01:32:39,442 --> 01:32:40,500
Sir!

853
01:32:46,449 --> 01:32:47,711
Have a seat, please.

854
01:32:55,859 --> 01:32:58,521
How're you doing, Madame?

855
01:33:01,665 --> 01:33:04,600
- It's you.. - Yes,
it's me.. Keemat.

856
01:33:06,369 --> 01:33:08,599
Inspector Keemat Lal!

857
01:33:09,839 --> 01:33:14,401
Officer Keemat Lal,
Intelligence Bureau.

858
01:33:16,413 --> 01:33:18,438
This time, you're in real trouble.

859
01:33:20,316 --> 01:33:22,546
- Look, Mr. Keemat..
-No 'Mr.' please..

860
01:33:22,952 --> 01:33:24,749
Just Keemat.

861
01:33:25,455 --> 01:33:27,446
I've gone through all your reports.

862
01:33:28,725 --> 01:33:33,628
The local police is
convinced about your involvement.

863
01:33:36,299 --> 01:33:38,995
According to them it's a
clear cut case of murder.

864
01:33:40,437 --> 01:33:43,372
But the case is sensitive.

865
01:33:44,007 --> 01:33:47,773
The Ministry of external affairs,
Russian embassy, are all involved..

866
01:33:49,646 --> 01:33:51,807
You are an intelligent woman.

867
01:33:54,017 --> 01:33:55,507
But, this time..

868
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:07,792
there is a certain item missing
from your husband's belongings.

869
01:34:13,369 --> 01:34:18,466
If only I could get
my hands on that..

870
01:34:22,912 --> 01:34:24,607
you get it?

871
01:34:35,325 --> 01:34:36,587
Trust me.

872
01:35:04,287 --> 01:35:07,279
That's it! Just
leave the rest to me.

873
01:35:08,391 --> 01:35:09,688
Great!

874
01:35:13,897 --> 01:35:19,563
By the way, what are you
doing this evening? Must be busy.

875
01:35:19,803 --> 01:35:22,738
I need to inspect
the scene of the crime.

876
01:35:24,908 --> 01:35:28,674
Maybe, some other time then..

877
01:35:32,382 --> 01:35:34,282
Do you prefer
vegetarian or non vegetarian?

878
01:35:37,287 --> 01:35:38,652
Don't bother..

879
01:35:39,823 --> 01:35:41,552
non vegetarian.

880
01:35:44,828 --> 01:35:48,423
And what would you prefer to drink?

881
01:35:52,569 --> 01:35:54,400
Nothing in particular..

882
01:35:57,841 --> 01:35:59,433
What do you prefer?

883
01:36:01,578 --> 01:36:04,411
Anything but vodka.

884
01:36:08,651 --> 01:36:11,586
You're going to get
me killed, Madame.

885
01:36:13,456 --> 01:36:15,981
Sorry.. Sunaina.

886
01:36:23,433 --> 01:36:24,593
Wow!

887
01:36:28,671 --> 01:36:31,697
I think I've had a
bit too much to drink.

888
01:36:34,944 --> 01:36:36,434
Never mind..

889
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:39,746
you'll sweat it out.

890
01:36:41,384 --> 01:36:42,476
Where?

891
01:36:42,785 --> 01:36:45,811
At the scene of the crime.

892
01:36:54,697 --> 01:36:56,562
It is pretty deep.

893
01:36:58,301 --> 01:37:01,828
In the dark anyone
could miss his step.

894
01:37:04,941 --> 01:37:07,705
It was a full moon night.

895
01:37:10,513 --> 01:37:11,946
Mind you, he didn't slip.

896
01:37:13,383 --> 01:37:14,680
He climbed down..

897
01:37:15,518 --> 01:37:16,883
on his own.

898
01:37:22,392 --> 01:37:25,623
Must've been slippery
because of the rain..

899
01:37:27,730 --> 01:37:32,360
.. and moss.

900
01:37:33,836 --> 01:37:35,269
The rain?

901
01:37:35,672 --> 01:37:37,264
In this season?

902
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:53,814
A lot of accidents can
happen when one is drunk.

903
01:37:58,695 --> 01:38:00,629
He had quit drinking.

904
01:38:11,808 --> 01:38:13,275
Alcohol!

905
01:38:16,312 --> 01:38:21,477
How do I..

906
01:38:22,518 --> 01:38:23,849
What should I say?

907
01:38:28,291 --> 01:38:29,519
Forget about it.

908
01:38:32,962 --> 01:38:34,395
Sorry?

909
01:38:39,369 --> 01:38:40,597
Madame!

910
01:38:44,273 --> 01:38:45,535
Darkness!

911
01:38:46,376 --> 01:38:49,004
Pitch black!

912
01:38:49,712 --> 01:38:54,775
Raining..

913
01:38:55,785 --> 01:38:58,913
cats and dogs!

914
01:38:59,422 --> 01:39:00,616
And..

915
01:39:05,294 --> 01:39:09,924
the white man slipped.

916
01:39:10,566 --> 01:39:11,794
Died!

917
01:39:12,335 --> 01:39:14,826
Reached hell. The
bastard deserved it!

918
01:39:16,939 --> 01:39:18,497
Madame!

919
01:39:48,471 --> 01:39:51,269
I'll never forget this favour.

920
01:39:53,376 --> 01:39:55,571
'Pure satisfaction.'

921
01:39:57,513 --> 01:40:00,607
Like I've bathed a hundred
times in the holy waters.

922
01:40:02,919 --> 01:40:04,716
No need to worry anymore.

923
01:40:06,856 --> 01:40:08,687
If you ever come to Delhi..

924
01:40:09,692 --> 01:40:11,455
I'd like to return the favour.

925
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:18,760
Should I go?

926
01:40:19,802 --> 01:40:20,962
Yes!

927
01:40:32,281 --> 01:40:36,047
Keemat left, only to return sooner.

928
01:40:37,587 --> 01:40:39,578
He definitely reached Delhi..

929
01:40:39,655 --> 01:40:42,624
but left his heart behind.

930
01:40:43,059 --> 01:40:46,324
He'd come back for it everytime..

931
01:40:46,395 --> 01:40:48,829
but always managed
to leave it behind.

932
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:52,033
Come Madame.

933
01:40:52,301 --> 01:40:53,598
Come.

934
01:41:39,982 --> 01:41:43,611
But Keemat kept on coming.

935
01:41:44,754 --> 01:41:47,416
Saheb was left with no other option.

936
01:41:51,894 --> 01:41:57,389
His quest for 'pure
satisfaction' knew no end.

937
01:42:07,910 --> 01:42:13,712
I confessed to my wife.

938
01:42:16,953 --> 01:42:18,318
Why?

939
01:42:22,258 --> 01:42:23,987
I wanted a divorce.

940
01:42:30,833 --> 01:42:32,460
And I got it too!

941
01:42:33,703 --> 01:42:34,931
Here, look!

942
01:42:41,644 --> 01:42:44,943
I can't live without you anymore.

943
01:42:46,482 --> 01:42:49,508
I'd rather die.

944
01:42:49,852 --> 01:42:51,513
I will die.

945
01:42:55,424 --> 01:42:58,416
I swear on the Lord himself!

946
01:43:05,835 --> 01:43:08,531
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son..

947
01:43:08,604 --> 01:43:10,936
..and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

948
01:43:11,707 --> 01:43:14,574
Since it is your intention
to enter into marriage..

949
01:43:14,777 --> 01:43:17,541
join your right hands and
declare your consent..

950
01:43:17,613 --> 01:43:18,671
..before God and his church.

951
01:43:22,818 --> 01:43:28,347
I Keemat Lal, take you Susanna
Anna Marie Johannes, to be my wife.

952
01:43:28,591 --> 01:43:32,493
I promise to be true to
you in good times and in bad,

953
01:43:32,528 --> 01:43:34,587
in sickness and in health.

954
01:43:34,664 --> 01:43:38,657
I will love you and honour you,
all the days of my life,

955
01:43:38,734 --> 01:43:40,895
till death do us apart.

956
01:43:41,604 --> 01:43:45,734
I Susanna Anna Marie Johannes, take
you Keemat Lal to be my husband.

957
01:43:45,941 --> 01:43:49,308
I promise to be true to
you in good times and in bad,

958
01:43:49,512 --> 01:43:51,036
in sickness and in health.

959
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:52,813
I will love you and honour you.

960
01:43:52,882 --> 01:43:56,579
.. all the days of my life,
till death do us apart.

961
01:44:55,811 --> 01:44:58,712
Oh my God. There was
poison in the Viagra bottle?

962
01:44:59,682 --> 01:45:01,809
The bottle contained Viagra pills.

963
01:45:02,685 --> 01:45:03,947
What was it then?

964
01:45:05,721 --> 01:45:07,279
Overdose?

965
01:45:07,656 --> 01:45:11,490
Leading to a massive heart attack.
Very unfortunate!

966
01:45:12,762 --> 01:45:14,354
Terrible accident!

967
01:45:14,597 --> 01:45:17,930
Accident? She killed him.
And you knew it.

968
01:45:18,334 --> 01:45:19,892
How would I know?

969
01:45:20,369 --> 01:45:23,566
Of course, you wouldn't.
You were blinded by her love.

970
01:45:26,475 --> 01:45:30,673
Some years later, I
returned from Russia, a Doctor.

971
01:45:31,847 --> 01:45:36,375
But Saheb had
turned into 'a patient.'

972
01:45:36,886 --> 01:45:38,979
My.. my.

973
01:45:40,990 --> 01:45:42,457
Look at you!

974
01:45:45,361 --> 01:45:48,853
What has the world
done to my little bunny!

975
01:45:55,004 --> 01:45:56,801
Happy New Year, Saheb

976
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:09,040
What are you looking for?

977
01:46:12,054 --> 01:46:13,817
I know there's one..

978
01:46:14,957 --> 01:46:16,288
hiding somewhere.

979
01:46:19,428 --> 01:46:24,388
I just can't seem to find
the rascal, when I want.

980
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:25,928
White hair?

981
01:46:28,771 --> 01:46:30,261
Don't say it aloud.

982
01:46:31,507 --> 01:46:32,997
It's a bad omen.

983
01:46:41,550 --> 01:46:42,812
Here it is.

984
01:46:42,852 --> 01:46:45,719
Show it. Let me see!

985
01:46:47,756 --> 01:46:49,451
Fetch the scissors..

986
01:46:49,525 --> 01:46:51,254
there on the record.

987
01:46:58,567 --> 01:46:59,829
Snip it at the root.

988
01:47:08,744 --> 01:47:09,870
See..

989
01:47:10,813 --> 01:47:12,940
how much I need you.

990
01:47:17,319 --> 01:47:20,618
Right there.. put it in the box.

991
01:47:27,563 --> 01:47:31,329
I hate New Year's Eve.

992
01:47:37,273 --> 01:47:39,264
When did you see me last?

993
01:47:41,477 --> 01:47:42,808
It's been two years.

994
01:47:46,849 --> 01:47:48,373
Do I look any different?

995
01:47:53,656 --> 01:47:56,989
You've become a
little more beautiful.

996
01:48:11,006 --> 01:48:12,633
I haven't changed at all?

997
01:48:26,655 --> 01:48:27,849
Sure?

998
01:48:35,898 --> 01:48:37,991
You've grown up to be shy.

999
01:48:48,711 --> 01:48:50,440
Please don't, Saheb

1000
01:48:50,512 --> 01:48:51,706
Why not?

1001
01:48:53,449 --> 01:48:56,247
It's my
responsibility to educate you.

1002
01:49:25,848 --> 01:49:30,979
The delicate thread
between us had snapped.

1003
01:49:32,821 --> 01:49:36,723
That was the last time,
I ever saw her.

1004
01:49:40,429 --> 01:49:41,623
The next morning..

1005
01:49:41,697 --> 01:49:46,691
I took Goonga along
and left her forever.

1006
01:50:02,584 --> 01:50:07,920
The secondary post mortem reports,
and facial superimpositions..

1007
01:50:08,457 --> 01:50:11,551
as well as the PCR tests,
clearly indicate that..

1008
01:50:12,695 --> 01:50:13,787
the samples match.

1009
01:50:15,931 --> 01:50:19,423
Hence, it is proven that..

1010
01:50:21,370 --> 01:50:22,701
she is dead.

1011
01:50:23,972 --> 01:50:25,496
Thank God!

1012
01:50:25,774 --> 01:50:28,868
No one to fear, and no
favours to be returned.

1013
01:50:33,816 --> 01:50:35,408
You still miss her, right?

1014
01:50:35,651 --> 01:50:36,777
No.

1015
01:50:38,053 --> 01:50:39,350
Liar.

1016
01:50:40,522 --> 01:50:42,752
Get some sleep. It's pretty late.

1017
01:50:43,926 --> 01:50:46,520
It's an early morning flight
and you need to be in time..

1018
01:50:46,595 --> 01:50:48,654
..for security check.

1019
01:50:54,937 --> 01:50:57,599
And just don't let me
catch you dreaming about her.

1020
01:52:48,617 --> 01:52:49,982
Hello!

1021
01:52:50,619 --> 01:52:53,850
Yes, can I speak to Mr.
Arun Kumar, please?

1022
01:52:58,861 --> 01:53:00,328
Sorry?

1023
01:53:03,999 --> 01:53:05,899
No, can you check again, please?

1024
01:53:05,968 --> 01:53:09,563
He should have arrived last night,
with the Criminal Forensics Group.

1025
01:53:10,339 --> 01:53:11,533
Yeah.

1026
01:53:16,445 --> 01:53:18,572
Okay.. no, thanks.

1027
01:53:25,287 --> 01:53:28,381
Come on, Nandi. Get a grip.

1028
01:53:29,925 --> 01:53:31,984
It'll be fine. I have a
friend working at Vodafone.

1029
01:53:32,027 --> 01:53:36,760
We'll find out right now,
details about his last call.

1030
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:39,892
Please calm down.

1031
01:53:40,369 --> 01:53:42,428
Here, have some water.

1032
01:53:43,038 --> 01:53:45,506
Mama.. mama.. it's daddy!

1033
01:53:45,574 --> 01:53:47,940
I told him you are very angry.

1034
01:53:48,010 --> 01:53:49,534
Hand me the phone.

1035
01:53:50,379 --> 01:53:52,279
Hello.. hello Arun.

1036
01:53:52,347 --> 01:53:54,577
Arun can you hear me.. hello!

1037
01:53:55,350 --> 01:53:57,284
Hello.. Arun.

1038
01:53:57,452 --> 01:53:58,783
Can you hear me? Hello!

1039
01:53:58,854 --> 01:54:00,048
Hello.

1040
01:54:00,455 --> 01:54:02,286
Hi Nandini.. how are you?

1041
01:54:02,357 --> 01:54:03,847
Where the fuck are you?

1042
01:54:03,926 --> 01:54:07,418
I tried calling you a hundred times.
There is no conference in Delhi.

1043
01:54:08,830 --> 01:54:09,956
Arun!

1044
01:54:10,499 --> 01:54:13,024
Say something for God's
sake Arun. Where are you?

1045
01:54:13,602 --> 01:54:15,467
Nandini, I'm fine wherever I am.

1046
01:54:16,905 --> 01:54:18,532
I'll be back in a day or two.

1047
01:54:21,843 --> 01:54:23,367
Arun, why?

1048
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:26,811
For what?

1049
01:54:28,784 --> 01:54:32,413
Is there someone else in your life?

1050
01:54:34,423 --> 01:54:37,790
I can't believe, you
would betray me for anyone.

1051
01:54:41,463 --> 01:54:42,657
But there is someone.

1052
01:54:44,433 --> 01:54:45,559
Is she alive?

1053
01:54:46,902 --> 01:54:48,267
Arun?

1054
01:54:49,671 --> 01:54:51,036
Is Susanna alive?

1055
01:55:16,832 --> 01:55:21,462
I feel such comfort,
just by looking at you.

1056
01:55:22,270 --> 01:55:24,670
It all comes down
to love, sweetheart!

1057
01:55:26,008 --> 01:55:28,374
Do you need more
time to think over it?

1058
01:55:31,913 --> 01:55:35,474
No. I've already made my decision.

1059
01:55:36,351 --> 01:55:37,682
Alright then.

1060
01:55:38,353 --> 01:55:40,913
See you in the church at 11.

1061
01:56:15,957 --> 01:56:18,289
I've repaid your favours, Saheb

1062
01:56:31,540 --> 01:56:33,565
Your Saheb is no more..

1063
01:56:38,246 --> 01:56:39,406
sugar.

1064
01:56:43,885 --> 01:56:48,413
I kept looking for reasons
to live, after you were gone.

1065
01:56:49,524 --> 01:56:52,254
And one day, I heard
about your wedding.

1066
01:56:52,928 --> 01:56:55,556
What better reason
could I have waited for..

1067
01:56:56,298 --> 01:56:57,595
to end my life.

1068
01:57:14,683 --> 01:57:17,413
Asshole.. I almost ran into you.

1069
01:57:18,353 --> 01:57:21,481
The phone and car,
are both out of order.

1070
01:57:21,890 --> 01:57:24,450
My mistress needs to
get to the hospital.

1071
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:27,690
Please, sir, for God's sake.

1072
01:57:27,996 --> 01:57:31,830
Please help, sir. Please!

1073
01:57:31,900 --> 01:57:34,528
Otherwise my mistress will die.

1074
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:43,539
I was desperate to finally
rest in the arms of Jesus.

1075
01:57:44,446 --> 01:57:46,641
Looks like Jesus changed his mind.

1076
01:57:46,815 --> 01:57:48,442
Last minute hitch.

1077
01:57:48,917 --> 01:57:53,718
Maybe in guilt, he sent me an angel.

1078
01:57:59,261 --> 01:58:01,593
I was dead in my head.

1079
01:58:02,430 --> 01:58:05,593
But when I woke up,
felt a little strange..

1080
01:58:05,967 --> 01:58:08,492
a pair of spectacles on God's nose?

1081
01:58:12,541 --> 01:58:13,633
You are..

1082
01:58:14,042 --> 01:58:15,441
Tarafdar.

1083
01:58:17,345 --> 01:58:20,781
Dr. Modhushudhon Tarafdar.

1084
01:58:21,283 --> 01:58:24,616
Who slowly became the
big brother of the house.

1085
01:58:24,819 --> 01:58:27,583
He was considered some
kind of Miracle Doctor.

1086
01:58:28,423 --> 01:58:30,755
A strange concoction of allopathy,
naturopathy..

1087
01:58:30,825 --> 01:58:33,885
.. ayurveda and spirituality.

1088
01:58:57,018 --> 01:58:59,282
Ridiculous!

1089
01:59:04,559 --> 01:59:08,393
This mushroom is
called Jack O' Lantern.

1090
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:18,836
It has a number of uses.
Very useful mushroom.

1091
01:59:20,475 --> 01:59:26,937
A bit could cure,
too much could kill.

1092
01:59:29,317 --> 01:59:31,444
There is plenty of evil all around.

1093
01:59:32,254 --> 01:59:33,414
Understand?

1094
01:59:34,789 --> 01:59:36,723
There is plenty of evil all around.

1095
01:59:37,425 --> 01:59:40,792
And even plenty is
never really enough..

1096
01:59:42,597 --> 01:59:44,497
it's always scarce.

1097
01:59:47,702 --> 01:59:50,466
But for the one who
survives even in scarcity..

1098
01:59:51,740 --> 01:59:54,470
nothing seems scarce.

1099
01:59:54,909 --> 01:59:58,310
Less, more.. more, less..
that's life.

1100
02:00:02,417 --> 02:00:07,855
So would you prefer
less or more in your soup?

1101
02:00:10,892 --> 02:00:16,762
For a healer like him, I was
willing to remain ill all my life.

1102
02:00:17,666 --> 02:00:24,868
And I would've but Modhu promised,
he wouldn't go back to Calcutta.

1103
02:00:26,041 --> 02:00:28,305
Marriage wasn't on my mind.

1104
02:00:28,677 --> 02:00:33,273
But Modhu wanted me to
be the heir to his wealth.

1105
02:00:33,882 --> 02:00:38,046
He was afraid that if he were
to leave this world before me..

1106
02:00:38,486 --> 02:00:43,890
then his ex-wife and
daughter would harass me.

1107
02:00:55,804 --> 02:00:58,295
My life was grounded..

1108
02:00:58,373 --> 02:01:01,001
but I was flying.

1109
02:01:01,343 --> 02:01:02,469
Modhu.. da.

1110
02:01:05,847 --> 02:01:08,941
What would I do without you!

1111
02:01:09,017 --> 02:01:10,507
Nothing!

1112
02:01:17,692 --> 02:01:19,626
- Come back fast. - Bye bye.

1113
02:01:39,481 --> 02:01:40,812
Khan..

1114
02:01:41,516 --> 02:01:43,381
what happened to the lights?

1115
02:02:00,835 --> 02:02:02,928
Khan.. Maggie aunty!

1116
02:02:04,973 --> 02:02:06,941
There's a robber upstairs.
And he has a knife.

1117
02:02:07,008 --> 02:02:08,532
Be careful!

1118
02:02:28,630 --> 02:02:32,964
News is just in that in
shootout at the Taj hotel..

1119
02:02:33,001 --> 02:02:36,368
NSE Major Sandeep
Unnikrishnan has been killed.

1120
02:02:36,438 --> 02:02:39,305
At the Trident
Oberoi and Nariman House..

1121
02:02:46,481 --> 02:02:48,005
Don't worry!

1122
02:02:48,283 --> 02:02:50,979
Everything will be fine, come..

1123
02:02:51,719 --> 02:02:52,981
come.

1124
02:02:58,793 --> 02:03:00,317
Modhu.

1125
02:03:02,430 --> 02:03:04,660
- Thank you. - Let me see?

1126
02:03:09,003 --> 02:03:10,300
Nice.

1127
02:03:36,264 --> 02:03:40,860
I was destined to be
with all the wrong men.

1128
02:03:44,772 --> 02:03:47,502
At first I was completely shattered!

1129
02:03:47,876 --> 02:03:50,970
But slowly I began to fear him.

1130
02:03:51,513 --> 02:03:54,448
For the first time, it was
my life that was in danger.

1131
02:04:00,488 --> 02:04:04,447
Look what I cooked
especially for you.

1132
02:04:06,995 --> 02:04:08,656
Your favourite!

1133
02:04:09,731 --> 02:04:11,722
Mushroom Veloute.

1134
02:05:31,579 --> 02:05:32,910
Susie!

1135
02:05:33,748 --> 02:05:36,239
Ghalib.. in the kitchen.

1136
02:06:49,791 --> 02:06:53,454
Yellow one, if taken in
large quantity is fatal..

1137
02:06:53,695 --> 02:06:55,253
.. but if you take
it in small quantity..

1138
02:06:55,329 --> 02:06:56,762
it produces hallucinations.

1139
02:06:56,831 --> 02:06:59,356
You know, what they call,
magic mushroom.

1140
02:07:01,502 --> 02:07:02,867
And this..

1141
02:07:09,811 --> 02:07:12,712
How can you think such a thing?
Have you lost it?

1142
02:07:15,483 --> 02:07:17,383
I saved your life.

1143
02:07:18,386 --> 02:07:19,944
Don't you remember?

1144
02:07:22,223 --> 02:07:23,588
Susanna..

1145
02:07:25,960 --> 02:07:28,929
What are you doing?

1146
02:07:31,933 --> 02:07:33,798
What is this, Susanna?

1147
02:07:34,469 --> 02:07:35,629
Susanna look..

1148
02:07:36,938 --> 02:07:40,931
This is a big misunderstanding,
Susanna.

1149
02:07:41,709 --> 02:07:43,438
Please.. this is a..

1150
02:07:46,914 --> 02:07:50,680
This is a big misunderstanding,
Susanna. And, even if it isn't..

1151
02:07:51,018 --> 02:07:52,645
what is the proof?

1152
02:07:57,525 --> 02:07:58,924
What are you doing?

1153
02:07:59,393 --> 02:08:01,020
Susanna, please don't do this.

1154
02:08:02,964 --> 02:08:06,695
Please, darling,
please listen to me.

1155
02:08:35,229 --> 02:08:38,824
Su.. Sus..

1156
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:40,627
Susanna..

1157
02:08:44,305 --> 02:08:45,533
It's your turn.

1158
02:08:54,315 --> 02:08:56,010
Susanna..

1159
02:08:58,586 --> 02:09:02,420
Susanna.. I needed the money.

1160
02:09:03,825 --> 02:09:06,350
I really needed it.

1161
02:09:06,427 --> 02:09:08,418
I lost a lot of money in business.

1162
02:09:08,496 --> 02:09:11,431
I went bloody bankrupt, Susanna.

1163
02:09:44,398 --> 02:09:45,763
Oh God!

1164
02:09:51,305 --> 02:09:52,465
Susanna..

1165
02:09:52,540 --> 02:09:53,700
Susanna..

1166
02:09:54,442 --> 02:09:56,637
Susanna, I loved you, Susanna.

1167
02:09:57,278 --> 02:10:00,008
Susanna.. I.. I really loved you.

1168
02:10:01,249 --> 02:10:03,683
I truly love you Susanna,
believe me.

1169
02:10:17,498 --> 02:10:18,658
Oh God!

1170
02:10:25,306 --> 02:10:28,833
I wasn't even destined
for a peaceful death.

1171
02:10:29,477 --> 02:10:33,538
I had forgotten all the bullets,
next to Tarafdar's body.

1172
02:10:41,822 --> 02:10:45,724
Sleeping pills had failed once..

1173
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:49,859
and I didn't want
to hang on a noose.

1174
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:34,667
Jesus!

1175
02:11:39,981 --> 02:11:41,039
Susie!

1176
02:11:49,357 --> 02:11:51,985
Oh my Jesus..

1177
02:11:52,059 --> 02:11:53,856
Susie!

1178
02:12:59,593 --> 02:13:04,030
I'd lost respect for myself.
I was shattered.

1179
02:13:04,598 --> 02:13:09,467
For a professional swimmer
drowning isn't an option.

1180
02:13:17,478 --> 02:13:21,505
I was punishing
myself for my cowardice.

1181
02:13:21,949 --> 02:13:24,941
A new death every moment.

1182
02:13:29,623 --> 02:13:31,591
And then I found out..

1183
02:13:31,826 --> 02:13:33,817
I was dead for the rest of world.

1184
02:13:40,468 --> 02:13:45,633
I couldn't let
Maggie's sacrifice go in vain.

1185
02:13:45,706 --> 02:13:53,044
She forced me to take
on life, one last time.

1186
02:13:57,284 --> 02:14:02,415
Of course, you were
forced into everything..

1187
02:14:02,490 --> 02:14:06,290
into marriage, into murders!

1188
02:14:07,828 --> 02:14:13,789
Did you ever stop to wonder,
why you committed all those sins?

1189
02:14:13,934 --> 02:14:15,060
For whom?

1190
02:14:18,839 --> 02:14:21,774
For my heart.

1191
02:14:21,842 --> 02:14:23,503
Your heart.. great!

1192
02:14:23,577 --> 02:14:24,737
My heart.

1193
02:14:24,812 --> 02:14:26,404
The heart..

1194
02:14:26,480 --> 02:14:29,278
For the sake of your heart..

1195
02:14:29,350 --> 02:14:32,410
you sent six people to their..

1196
02:14:32,486 --> 02:14:35,512
final abode before their time.

1197
02:14:39,627 --> 02:14:42,858
You won't understand, sugar.

1198
02:14:45,900 --> 02:14:47,424
Here's a little fact.

1199
02:14:47,501 --> 02:14:50,493
Every single wife..

1200
02:14:50,671 --> 02:14:54,698
has at least once in
her life entertained..

1201
02:14:54,775 --> 02:15:00,270
the thought of
getting rid of her husband.

1202
02:15:01,282 --> 02:15:03,443
Why don't you ask your wife?

1203
02:15:03,617 --> 02:15:06,450
I'm sure she's thought
of at least one way..

1204
02:15:06,520 --> 02:15:08,511
to murder you.

1205
02:15:13,928 --> 02:15:17,762
Any idea why you've survived?

1206
02:15:18,933 --> 02:15:20,730
A child!

1207
02:15:22,403 --> 02:15:25,304
A child makes..

1208
02:15:27,274 --> 02:15:31,301
the husband more acceptable.

1209
02:15:36,750 --> 02:15:40,516
That's the reason why
you never had a child!

1210
02:15:43,924 --> 02:15:48,793
You fulfilled that desire of mine.

1211
02:15:52,766 --> 02:15:57,635
Never have I shared
our love with anyone..

1212
02:15:58,672 --> 02:16:00,833
nor will I ever in the future.

1213
02:16:01,008 --> 02:16:02,839
In the future?

1214
02:16:05,846 --> 02:16:08,610
Now you won't find a
sacrificial lamb, Saheb.

1215
02:16:09,583 --> 02:16:11,881
Your beauty..

1216
02:16:15,923 --> 02:16:18,551
You've become a little scary.

1217
02:16:18,826 --> 02:16:23,388
Scary.. scary, scary!

1218
02:16:23,464 --> 02:16:29,334
Scary.. scary, scary!

1219
02:16:32,606 --> 02:16:37,339
He has accepted me
for the person I am..

1220
02:16:37,811 --> 02:16:42,748
with all my sins and
virtues and this scary..

1221
02:16:42,816 --> 02:16:46,479
scary face of mine.

1222
02:16:48,389 --> 02:16:49,788
Who?

1223
02:16:51,792 --> 02:16:53,851
My seventh husband.

1224
02:16:55,396 --> 02:16:57,956
I feel like getting
married again, you know.

1225
02:16:58,732 --> 02:17:00,324
For a change!

1226
02:17:02,369 --> 02:17:03,700
For a change?

1227
02:17:05,906 --> 02:17:10,434
There's a beautiful church,
in the old city.

1228
02:17:14,048 --> 02:17:15,675
Will you come?

1229
02:17:16,817 --> 02:17:20,617
Tomorrow morning. Eleven o'clock.

1230
02:17:30,364 --> 02:17:34,357
I won't let you take
another life, Saheb.

1231
02:17:41,842 --> 02:17:43,742
Hey sugar!

1232
02:17:44,578 --> 02:17:47,604
You won't be able to save him.

1233
02:17:50,517 --> 02:17:53,816
He has already
sacrificed himself.. for love.

1234
02:17:57,591 --> 02:17:59,991
He is dead.

1235
02:18:02,529 --> 02:18:03,962
And this time..

1236
02:18:04,031 --> 02:18:07,865
I am going to drink his blood.

1237
02:18:59,486 --> 02:19:05,015
The world, the
universe and its radiance..

1238
02:19:05,292 --> 02:19:08,420
aren't enough to satisfy my soul.

1239
02:19:08,662 --> 02:19:16,296
This peace, this joy, can be
attained, only through Jesus Christ.

1240
02:19:17,004 --> 02:19:19,768
Who is very dear to me.

1241
02:19:20,641 --> 02:19:23,235
The Lord of the Universe.

1242
02:19:23,977 --> 02:19:27,811
I, Sister Anna..

1243
02:19:28,982 --> 02:19:31,610
in the presence of Mother Mary..

1244
02:19:31,785 --> 02:19:35,277
solemnly vow to Lord Jesus that..

1245
02:19:35,722 --> 02:19:39,556
from now on I belong to Him alone.

1246
02:19:42,496 --> 02:19:46,626
From today he is my only master..

1247
02:19:48,469 --> 02:19:49,902
my spouse.

1248
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:13,291
There is not a soul in sight now

1249
02:20:15,629 --> 02:20:20,896
Come, acknowledge me now, at least

1250
02:20:23,871 --> 02:20:30,299
Not a soul stirs this moment

1251
02:20:32,446 --> 02:20:37,281
Come, embrace me in your fold

1252
02:20:40,787 --> 02:20:46,817
Embrace me just this once

1253
02:20:47,060 --> 02:20:51,827
Then take me along

1254
02:20:53,000 --> 02:21:01,840
Hope there is no
misery on the other side

1255
02:21:02,342 --> 02:21:05,038
Jesus

1256
02:21:06,613 --> 02:21:09,548
Jesus

1257
02:21:10,083 --> 02:21:14,952
You hear the tolling

Yet all you choose
is to keep your quiet

Jesus

1261
02:21:27,601 --> 02:21:35,667
How do you pick who amongst
us is worthy of your grace

1262
02:21:35,976 --> 02:21:38,501
Jesus

1263
02:21:39,713 --> 02:21:44,309
You hear the tolling
of the church bells

1264
02:21:44,551 --> 02:21:46,951
Jesus

1265
02:21:48,288 --> 02:21:52,725
Yet all you choose
is to keep your quiet

1266

Jesus

1267
02:22:07,641 --> 02:22:10,735
I want to confess my sins, Father!

1268
02:22:13,313 --> 02:22:15,406
My seven sins.

1269
02:22:42,376 --> 02:22:43,866
Arun.. Arun!

1270
02:22:43,944 --> 02:22:46,310
Stop the car! Stop it fast.

1271
02:22:50,417 --> 02:22:52,942
Arun! Arun!

1272
02:23:00,894 --> 02:23:03,886
I hate you, I hate you.

1273
02:23:05,432 --> 02:23:06,660
I'm fine, Nandini.

1274
02:23:06,733 --> 02:23:08,530
I told you I'll come back soon.

1275
02:23:08,568 --> 02:23:10,001
You lied to me!

1276
02:23:10,070 --> 02:23:12,800
I'm fine, I'm fine!

1277
02:23:20,480 --> 02:23:21,845
Did you say anything to the police?

1278
02:23:21,915 --> 02:23:23,940
I haven't told them the truth yet.

1279
02:23:23,984 --> 02:23:26,282
Or you'd be in jail for
the rest of your life.

1280
02:23:27,020 --> 02:23:28,578
If you ever..

1281
02:23:29,289 --> 02:23:31,484
try to see her again..

1282
02:23:31,725 --> 02:23:33,784
then I swear I'll kill you.

1283
02:23:34,628 --> 02:23:35,822
Never.

1284
02:23:36,430 --> 02:23:37,556
Ever.

1285
02:23:37,631 --> 02:23:38,893
She's dead.

1286
02:23:39,866 --> 02:23:41,458
Forever.

1287
02:23:46,440 --> 02:23:47,998
- Promise? - Promise.

1288
02:23:50,977 --> 02:23:52,672
What happened to your specs?

1289
02:23:55,649 --> 02:23:57,412
Someone cast an evil eye.

00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:51,707
A human's lungs are like
sponge which are made to breath air.

14
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:53,874
But some people..

15
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:56,040
Use the lungs to breath..

16
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,082
Beedi and cigarette smoke.

17
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,749
If you squeeze the lungs of..

18
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,665
A man who smokes.

19
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,790
Then you'll get cancer producing tar..

20
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,082
In such high quantity that..

21
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,082
So much tar can make you sick.

22
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:17,624
It is enough to make you really sick.

23
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:20,499
We see 50 patients daily.

24
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,374
Approximately a 1000 in a month.

25
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,832
80% or 90% mouth cancer..

26
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,499
Happens by chewing tobacco.

27
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,165
This is Mukesh's story.

28
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,415
My name is Mukesh.

29
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,165
I used to chew tobacco.

30
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,457
I've got cancer now,
my operation is due.

31
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,624
Probably, I can't say anything more.

32
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:39,374
Alas, Mukesh couldn't survive.

33
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:42,249
He was 24 years old.

34
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:45,124
Tobacco, betel leaf,
chewing tobacco, paan masala..

35
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,165
Everything is dangerous.

36
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:15,208
""Like you need breaths..""

37
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,207

I was standing on my own two feet.'

'Just 20 minutes ago, they 11 bones..'

46

""..and cracked my skull.""

47
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,124
'Murari was right.'

48
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,415
'This mess was created by me.'

49
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,332
'But someone's love had
become the bane of my life.'

'But my story doesn't start here.'

51
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,999
'My story starts at Banaras.'

- All hail Lord Shiva.
- All hail Lord Shiva.'

53
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,832
'All hail Lord Shiva.'

00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,332
'l was a free soul.'

55
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,915
It was not just difficult
but impossible to catch me.'

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,999
'All hail Lord Shiva.
All hail Lord Shiva.'

57
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,999
'All hail, sir.'

58
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,999
Uncle Rameshwar, out with some money.

59
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,790
This time we'll burn
Ravana's effigy in a way..

60
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,124
That no one would dare
to burn Ravana's effigy again.

61
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,332
But why are you dressed
like Lord Shiva to ask..

62
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,332
For donation for Dussehra?

63
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,582
You should have dressed
up like Rama, right?

64
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:33,415
Would Rama himself have
come to ask for donation..

65
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,540
To save his own wife?

66
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:36,999
Would he have liked that?

67
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,207
That's why he sent me.

68
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,040
After all, I am His special friend.
Am I not?

69
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,874
- Here you go.
- All hail Lord Shiva.

70
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,332
Bindiya. Brother, did you see Bindiya?

71
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,999
- No.
- That Kundan will spoil her.

72
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,082
- Hide, hide.
- Bindiya.

73
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,082
Seems like your father has come,
Bindiya.

74
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,665
Go. Or else all of us would
get beaten up because of you.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,281
You are scared because my
father is a policeman, isn't it?

76
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,707
I am scared of nobody.

77
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,790
Your father has messed up my life.

78
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,999
Okay. Hold on. I'll call him.

79
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,207
Papa.

80
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,165
Please. Quiet. Quiet.

81
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,249
I shall be doomed if I don't
rip off your father's clothes one day.

82
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,749
Come on.

83
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,082
All hail Lord Shiva.

84
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,999
Uncle, we've come from
the third lane of Hanuman Phatak.

85
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,999
For donation.
As we have to burn Ravana's effigy.

86
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,332
Hope you won't burn down someone else.

87
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,624
Uncle, if you think this is a lie.
You can come there and check.

88
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:25,999
Give it. Give him the receipt.

89
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,832
Here. 100 rupees.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,582
- Okay. Junaid. Get 100 rupees.
- Yes.

91
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,499
Murari, we...

92
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:47,249
'That day,
that very moment, that very second..'

93
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,457
'..it felt as if Lord Shiva
had answered all my prayers. '

94
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,249
'200 years ago the king
of Banaras had brought..'

95
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,374
'..my forefathers from
a village in Tamil Nadu.'

96
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,540
'To be his personal priests.'

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,582
'But it felt as if Banaras
had accepted me today.'

98
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,332
'This was Banaras's first gift to me.'

99
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,315
'She was the one offering prayers..'

100
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
'..but it felt as if
my prayers had been answered.'

101
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,999
'l was still a kid.'

102
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
'But all of a sudden
it felt as if I was an adult.'

103
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,040
'Old enough to marry.'

104
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:18,582
'Old enough to live and
die in that girl's love.'

105
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:59,749
""All I demand is you.""

106
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:03,832
""All my immaturity is limited to you.""

107
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:09,790
""All my eyes look for are you.""

108
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,499
""You give me joy as well sorrow.""

109
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:20,915

âI am smitten by you and you only.""

116

You dare tease the
girl of our territory.

117
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:21,249
- Dogs have territories.
- Lions have guts.

118
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,624
Darn you.

119
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:23,874
Hey... don't beat me. Okay.

120
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,832
I will beat you to
an inch of your life.

121
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,790
Murari. Don't let them get away.
Catch him.

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,832
Look aunt, these scoundrels
have been beaten up again.

123
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,076
They were teasing with girls.

124
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,999
Aunty, we only fell down, She's lying.

125
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:44,041
""Delicate. And shy.
Delicate. My heart lets out a tune.""

126
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:57,124
""Your eyes are mesmeric.""

127
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:05,708
""Don't give me those mesmeric looks.""

128
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,915
""To you. All the roads lead to you.""

129
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:14,082
âI'm drawn to you.
All I want is to meet you.""

130

âI'll meet you. Only you. Only you.""

131
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:31,833
""Fiery face. And the dark eyes.""

132
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,874
""We fight and squabble.""

133
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,374
""You seem to be mine.
And sometimes you seem like a dream.""

134
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:46,915
""When you look at me.""

135
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:55,583
""Your eyes pierce straight
through my heart.""

136
00:09:56,125 --> 00:10:03,790
""You control my destiny.""

137
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:12,500
""How do I get out of this dilemma?""

138
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:28,458
""Only you.
Only you. Only you, sweetheart.""

139
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:36,499

""All my intelligence
is limited to you.""

142
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,999
""All I prepare for is you. Only you.""

143
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:52,999
""Only you.""

144
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:58,415
âI am smitten by you and you only.""

145
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:05,987
Someone will take your girl away.

146
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,665
And you will be left
licking your wounds.

147
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,665
What do you mean?

148
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,190
I mean if you don't express it now..

149
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,457
You'll be seen eating
sweets in the girl's wedding.

150
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,749
Sanju!

151
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,832
""Only you. Only you.""

152
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,499
""My smartness is limited to you.""

153
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,790
""My youth is all for you.""

154
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,749
""My smartness is limited to you.""

155
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,915
""My youth is all for you.""

156
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,999
""My story ends on you.""

157
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,374
""My story ends only on you.""

158
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:41,458
""Only you. Only you.""

159
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,499
I love you.

160
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,832
Did he scare you? Go.

161
00:11:56,875 --> 00:12:00,040
I'll slap you and you'll
stop flirting around.

162
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,707
I am prepared for that. Here.

163
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:08,874
Tell me your name at least.

164
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,249
Come tomorrow again to
get slapped and I'll tell you.

165
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:23,125
âI'm in love.
Someone come and check on me.""

166
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:39,332
âI locked eyes with her smack
in the middle of the market.""

167
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:47,583
âI'm in love.
Someone come and check on me.""

168
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:55,540
âI have locked eyes at a tender age.""

169
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,540
- It's my last board paper tomorrow.
- Very nice.

170
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,082
Come and meet me at
the fort at Ganga's banks.

171
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,874
At 5.

172
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:08,749
And listen. I'm meeting
you because of your consistency.

173
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,249
Not out of love.

174
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,207
No matter the reason. Just meet me.

175
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,999
Leave the rest to destiny.

176
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,900
You have slapped me 15 times.
Tell me your name at least now.

177
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,915
- Zoya.
- Zoya.

178
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,332
- And yours?
- Rizwan.

179
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,332
Rizwan.

180
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,915
Oh my! You look cool.

181
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,540
Why? Can't I?

182
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,332
No. You can. Why not?

183
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,915
But mister,
I know whom you are pursuing.

184
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,249
Heard that you're going to the fort
today to show that witch the moon.

185
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,415
You are a witch. Get lost.

186
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,957
- Great. Great. Love her and beat me.
- Lay off.

187
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,249
You are looking nice, mister.

188
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,707
If that witch casts
an evil eye on you..

189
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,082
Then you'll have to marry me.

190
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:59,249
Why don't you ever show me the moon?

191
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,957
Go count the stars, Bindiya.

192
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,874
Go to hell.

193
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,999
Your heartbeat is saying something.

194
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,457
It says something...

195
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:15,207
Your heartbeat is saying something.

196
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,499
What happened?

197
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,249
What is this?

198
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,957
I bought the I love you card in haste.
Thought you would take of fence.

199
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:05,040
- So I bought this.
- You are a bumpkin.

200
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,999
Is this any way to propose to a girl?

201
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:25,124
Listen to your heart first.
Then let your eyes take control.

202
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,999
Your heartbeat is saying something.

203
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:34,040
I suggest you should
listen to your heart.

204
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:47,790
Your eyes are glistening in the sun.
The sun...

205
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,957
Sorry, I forgot.

206
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,582
If this is you...
then I have been smitten by you.

207
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:18,124
- What is your name?
- Rizwan.

208
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,874
And your father's?

209
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,457
Mirza Galib.

210
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,082
You didn't think? Did you?

211
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,165
'This was the sixteenth slap.'

212
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,290
'But I was happy to have kissed her.'

213
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,332
'Rather than be sad about the slap.'

214
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,374
I hate liars.

215
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,332
'What could be better than
a wife of sound character?'

216
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,832
'But I was a Banarasi priest.
Dark at that.'

217
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,915
How could I accept defeat?

218
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,874
In U.P. girls are cajoled in two ways.

219
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,624
First is dedication.
Follow her around all day.

220
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,249
Write love letters,
and ask her friend to deliver it.

221
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,749
But, every boy in U.P was doing that.

222
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,332
'But I wasn't a handsome hunk.'

223
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,040
'To have passed by doing all this.'

224
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,457
'So I failed.'

225
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:04,999
Now, the second way.

226
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,790
Scaring the girl.

227
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:07,999
What are you doing?

228
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,540
If you stop the vehicle you'll
not be able to drive it from tomorrow.

229
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,332
- What's the problem?
- You're the problem.

230
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,376
- Don't chase me around.
- So whom should I chase?

231
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,332
I don't know. But don't chase me.

232
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,374
Say that you don't love me.

233
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,749
I don't love you.

234
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,040
Just because I am a Hindu.

235
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,165
If you say I'll read
out the Kalma(holy book).

236
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,790
You are a liar.

237
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:32,207
Say that you don't love me.
Or I'll slit the wrist.

238
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,207
Mine.

239
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,957
I don't love you.

240
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,249
What are you doing?

241
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,915
I've suffered enough humiliation.

242
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,767
You'll leave for
Aligarh tomorrow itself.

243
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,207
Go to your aunt's place.
And study there.

244
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:19,124
Just think, sir.
The boy is Hindu.

245
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,707
We'll be disgraced in society.

246
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,671
What about your daughter who flirts
around with the entire neighbourhood?

247
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,915
How dare you come here
to complain about me?

248
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,499
- Get lost.
- Keep quiet.

249
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,957
Keep quiet.

250
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,207
Is this the age to be doing all this?

251
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,582
And from where did
you learn to misbehave?

252
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,176
You'll be leaving for
Aligarh tomorrow itself.

253
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,624
Kundan, your father-in-law's sending..

254
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,540
Your wife away to Aligarh,
forcefully.

255
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,499
Hurry up, or you will miss her.

256
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,874
Find another Ram, he's gone for good.

257
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,582
Your papa and I love you a lot.

258
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,874
But what you've done
will not be tolerated.

259
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,749
Study hard, Zoya.

260
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,082
And remember what we said.

261
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,665
And don't get down at any station.

262
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:13,458
Zoya!

263
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,332
Are you blind?

264
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,665
Zoya, don't worry.
I'll wait for you.

265
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:44,957
You bet. By the time you
return everything would've changed.

266
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,665
Waiting for you. Always.

267
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:55,707
'That day I realised that heart
is neither on the left or right.'

268
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,582
'It is in the center.'

269
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,999
'Because there is
where I felt the pain.'

270
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,374
'But I wasn't dead yet.'

271
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:08,582
'Because this wasn't the
end of the story by any means.'

272
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:12,415
'l was yet to reach my prime.'

273
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:19,082
No, Kundan.

274
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,665
Let papa go.

275
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:31,707
Kundan! This isn't right.

276
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,280
I'll punish both of you in jail.

277
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,124
I'm ready to go to jail.
Just let me colour you once.

278
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,874
- Beware, Murari. I'll kill you.
- Catch him.

279
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,790
Tear his clothes off.

280
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,415
Kundan, the arms of law are very long.

281
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,540
And so are the legs of criminals.

282
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,540
Careful, papa.

283
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,457
Kundan.

284
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,915
Hail Mahadev!

285
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,707
You're always doing as you want.

286
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:24,957
Papa was on duty.

287
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,540
You think you're funny.
I'll show you.

288
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,832
You are a rascal.

289
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,624
Will you rip off just
my father's clothes?

290
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,540
Kundan is not that easy to get,
Bindiya.

291
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,511
If you think you can entice me with
your beauty then you are so wrong.

292
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,374
Your competition is returning.

293
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,290
Rascal. Darn you and that witch.

294
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,457
Even after 8 years, you're
still in love with her, isn't it?

295
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:21,207
- Go to hell, Kundan.
- Murari.

296
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:22,915
You are great.

297
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,915
She'll die a torturous death. I swear.

298
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,957
Vultures will feast on her,
and you too.

299
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,499
What news you've given me!

300
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:38,249
""Come. Come back to your love.""

301
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:43,999
""Someone's waiting for you.""

302
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:53,125
""My luck will change.
My luck will change.""

303
00:22:56,166 --> 00:23:03,457
""For the better. For the better.""

304
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:17,749
""There is chaos and music everywhere.""

305
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,832
""You've left to come to me.""

306
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:24,374
""Love is in the air.
Sweetheart, please show up.""

307
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:28,374
âI am madly in love with you.""

308
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:32,374
""You are the only one I have.""

309
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:37,124
""You light up my life.""

310
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,624
""You are the only one I have.""

311
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,457
""You are my world.""

312
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:53,582
""You are the only one I have.""

313
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,499
""My body is grooving.
My heart's thumping.""

314
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,540
""In waiting for you.""

315
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:25,707
""The entire world knows
what's in my heart.""

316
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:27,999
""Only I know what's in your heart.""

317
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:32,332
""Let me feel a little more love.""

318
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:36,540
""Show me a little more love.""

319
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:40,665
âI'm madly in love with you.""

320
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:48,958
""You are the only one I have.""

321
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:06,082
âI see vibrancy all around. Everything
seems to have come to life.""

322
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:10,374
âI'm so proud of myself.
I have lost control.""

323
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:14,540
âI see vibrancy all around. Everything
seems to have come to life.""

324
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:18,832
âI'm so proud of myself.
I have lost control.""

325
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:23,040
""Come and whisk me away.""

326
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:27,290
""Come and take me away with a smile.""

327
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,457
""There is chaos and music everywhere.""

328
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:31,582
""You've left to come to me.""

329
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:36,540
""Love is in the air.
Sweetheart, please show up.""

330
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,415
Seems like sir's car has broken down.

331
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,582
To hell with the sir.

332
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,790
Are you going to meet
her in front of him?

333
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:44,999
- Hold the wrench.
- Yes.

334
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:46,165
Lord Shiva is on our side.

335
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,957
Not just Lord Shiva.
Even the spark plug of the sir's car..

336
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:50,499
Is on our side.

337
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:52,332
Murari, you are genius.

338
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:57,457
Run, quickly. I'll handle here.

339
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,249
- Is there a problem?
- No.

340
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:13,665
Don't be so unfair.
Let's carry one bag at least.

341
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,165
We talked to him for two hours.

342
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,582
Let him do work worth
200 bucks at least.

343
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:18,827
- Shall I give him the books as well?
- Sure. Go ahead.

344
00:26:58,541 --> 00:27:00,040
What? She just didn't recognize you?

345
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,540
Right. She just passed by.

346
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:08,499
But Murari, she is really beautiful.

347
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,915
Even Katrina Kaif pales
in comparison to her.

348
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,040
Yes, she is your Katrina Kaif.

349
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,207
And both,
she and Katrina don't recognize you.

350
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,249
- How is it going, Kundan?
- Hello, aunty.

351
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:26,499
But Kundan,
we haven't run out of gas yet?

352
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:28,457
- Aunty, it's the festive season.
- Yes.

353
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:30,540
- You will not get it later.
- That's right.

354
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:32,082
Come. Keep it here.

355
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:37,540
Okay, Kundan. Look, the sink
pipe has started leaking again.

356
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:38,707
Please change it.

357
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,249
Okay. I'll check.

358
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:46,082
And the servicing of the
Fiat was not up to the mark.

359
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,040
We had to go pick
up Zoya this morning.

360
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,707
And it just wouldn't start.

361
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:53,082
- I need to check the spark plug.
- Yes.

362
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:19,290
So brother... did she recognize you?

363
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:23,457
Did she recognize you?

364
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,707
It means that this
girl has lost her memory.

365
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:32,082
Take her to some doctor.

366
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:34,407
She will refuse to come.
But still, take her to a doctor.

367
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:36,540
Come on. Get lost. Go.

368
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:38,624
Okay. All hail Lord Shiva.

369
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,457
How are you?

370
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:54,999
I am good now.

371
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:57,284
That is what I was wondering.
What's wrong with Banaras?

372
00:29:57,416 --> 00:29:59,499
Even the delivery guys
are flirting with girls.

373
00:29:59,708 --> 00:30:02,832
I felt that I have seen you somewhere.

374
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,207
How is the wrist?

375
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:07,999
This one.

376
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:11,874
- Okay. See you.
- When?

377
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:14,540
Soon. Bye.

378
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:38,624
From a small school to JNU.

379
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:40,415
How did you get there?

380
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,374
Have you stopped eating
Gol Gappas(snacks)?

381
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:46,582
This is my friend. Rashmi.

382
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:48,124
Rashmi, this is...

383
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:50,249
Myself Shankar. Kundan Shankar.

384
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:52,749
- Are the Gol Gappas good?
- They are excellent.

385
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:58,624
- Zoya, how are we going to go?
- Where?

386
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,957
We have to elope, right?

387
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,540
Why are we going to elope?

388
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:10,374
Okay. So I'll convert into a Muslim.

389
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,540
Why would you convert into a Muslim?

390
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:15,499
Then how will we get married?

391
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,582
Whose marriage?

392
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:18,874
Yours and mine.

393
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:20,165
Hold on, brother.

394
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:22,290
Why would I and you get married?

395
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:25,749
- Because we love each other.
- Since when?

396
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:29,957
- Are five done?
- There is one left.

397
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,499
So give. And some more for madam.

398
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:34,540
One minute.

399
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:39,832
- What were you saying?
- Talk decently.

400
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:44,624
Okay. Let's make this a little decent.

401
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:46,499
When did we fall in love?

402
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:47,999
Give this to me.

403
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:49,082
What do you mean when
did we fall in love?

404
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:50,624
We have been in love
since the last 8 years.

405
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,828
In your dreams, Kundan.
There is nothing of that sort.

406
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:54,154
I was in the 9th grade back then.

407
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:57,040
Yes. As if I was pursuing law.

408
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:58,749
I was also in the 10th grade.

409
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:01,415
Kundan, we were immature then.

410
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,707
So now we are mature. Do it now.

411
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:07,415
You're mad, Kundan.
There is nothing of that sort.

412
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:09,790
Rashmi, let's go. Come on.

413
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:11,290
Who is he?

414
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:13,790
He was my friend when I was small.
He is mad.

415
00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:18,124
Listen you rickshaw driver,
don't take money from madam.

416
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,249
She is your sister-in-law.

417
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:20,499
Which one, brother?

418
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,582
The tall one who is angry.

419
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,290
What are you looking at?
Look in front.

420
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:27,598
You're mad.
There is nothing of that sort.

421
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:29,707
- Forget me.
- You forget me.

422
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:34,540
Forget me means goodbye.

423
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:37,999
The 10 year investment
has gone down the drain.

424
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:44,999
Murari, I have come at the right time.

425
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:46,540
Here's some sweet.

426
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:48,749
I heard that the priest's
son has become a widower.

427
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:50,207
Oh Lord!

428
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,980
What are you going to do now, mister?

429
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:54,540
Your sweetheart has lost her memory.

430
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:56,040
Hide.

431
00:32:56,416 --> 00:33:00,707
Murari, shut her up.
Or I'll beat her up.

432
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:02,582
Bindiya, stop deriving
pleasure from this.

433
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:04,290
The boy is serious.

434
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,415
Kundan, your Lord
cannot be such a liar.

435
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:09,165
I have been fasting on
Mondays for the last 15 years.

436
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,832
You are not marrying Zoya.

437
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:12,290
Do you want a beating?

438
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:14,082
I had told you.
I had told you. You'll get beaten up.

439
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:15,540
Okay. Okay. Leave her.

440
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:18,332
Don't push her down
and hit her on the back.

441
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:19,499
Don't throw her out.

442
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,124
- Don't throw her out the house.
- Rascal!

443
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,374
Threw her out of the house.

444
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,040
You moron! I curse you.

445
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:25,457
What happened, Bindiya?

446
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:27,790
Aunty, he is drunk in the afternoon.
That dog.

447
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,915
Banaras will rejoice
the day you marry me, Kundan.

448
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,999
I would rather marry
a witch than marry you.

449
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:35,457
Why you..

450
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:38,249
- You are the witch.
- Yes. Break the sandal as well.

451
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:49,124
- Kundan.
- Shut up.

452
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:50,915
- You monkey.
- You're the monkey.

453
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,415
Since you have a tail.

454
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:55,207
Zoya... Curses.

455
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,415
It's stuck.

456
00:33:57,916 --> 00:33:59,915
- Kundan, thank God I found you.
- Tell me.

457
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,880
I was looking for you
in the university as well.

458
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,499
We have a small function
at home tomorrow.

459
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:06,207
We are expecting around 50-60 guests.

460
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:08,582
Well, I have told Sunder
to do the decoration.

461
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:11,124
You also get some of
your boys to work on it.

462
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:12,665
Will come handy.

463
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:16,082
What's happening tomorrow night?

464
00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:18,707
Nothing as such.
You have come after so long.

465
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:21,624
And nothing has happened
in the house all this while.

466
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:23,540
Great. Not bad.

467
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:26,165
Kundan, what are you doing here?

468
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:31,040
- Well...
- He has come to wear bangles.

469
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:35,124
Listen. Why does she
laugh when she sees you?

470
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:38,290
Because she feels shy.

471
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:41,499
Now would she stare her
eyes out at her future husband?

472
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:44,582
A little shyness. A little shame.

473
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,332
This is the mark of a woman, Murari.

474
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:49,582
No. I think you'll
have a slit wrist again.

475
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,499
- Darn you.
- It's strange.

476
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,499
Get lost.

477
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:58,457
Everyone's looking so decent.

478
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:02,374
Pal, where is your madam?

479
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,290
And nor is her intelligent
friend to be seen.

480
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:10,457
No problem.
Both of them must be having a bath.

481
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:12,624
Shut up.

482
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:15,415
So Kundan.
Is everything under control?

483
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:17,665
- Yes, uncle.
- Handle everything.

484
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:19,332
A match is coming to see Zoya.

485
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:20,499
He is a doctor.

486
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:22,249
We'll get her married
to him if he likes her.

487
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:24,540
I will also be retiring in two years.

488
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:26,540
Where is Zoya?

489
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,499
What did father-in-law say?

490
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,499
Stop.

491
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:47,415
You are fooling me?

492
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:49,040
What nonsense, Kundan.

493
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:50,332
Let go of my hand. It hurts.

494
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:54,124
I am also hurting.
I have slit my wrist once.

495
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:55,999
Mind you, this time I'll slit yours.

496
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:57,332
What's wrong, Kundan?

497
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:59,749
- Why are you acting crazy?
- Okay.

498
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:03,332
Don't you know that a boy
is coming to see you this evening?

499
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:06,957
That is why your father
is having this celebration.

500
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:16,207
Mummy, is some boy coming
to see me this evening.

501
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:17,874
- Yes.
- Why didn't you tell me?

502
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:19,165
What should I have told you?

503
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,749
Your father has fixed everything.

504
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:22,790
Mummy, I am not a kid anymore
that you can do as you please.

505
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:24,124
I don't want to marry.

506
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:26,540
Zoya, don't create a scene.

507
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:29,374
Meet the boy and then let's see.

508
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:32,707
Look, he is only coming to see you.

509
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:34,681
You're not getting
married in the evening.

510
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,582
I have lots on my plate. Let me go.

511
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:44,457
- Listen.
- Sister-in-law. Zoya. Ms. Zoya.

512
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,374
Kundan will attend
the evening's party, right?

513
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,457
How can he not come?

514
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:52,040
The guru has given him
the job of serving sherbets.

515
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,790
Here, take all of it.

516
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:02,415
When will you people
stop acting silly?

517
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:06,207
Drink one at least first. Keep it. Go.

518
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:17,040
- Kundan, Zoya is calling you.
- Why?

519
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:19,874
Why don't you ask her?

520
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,374
I didn't know of all this, Kundan.

521
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:44,957
I don't want to marry that boy.

522
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,707
I see. So then?

523
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:53,790
Save me from all of this, Kundan?

524
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:56,290
Otherwise I'll slit
my wrist before you do.

525
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:59,374
Don't say so, Zoya. Wait and watch.

526
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:03,290
- Move.
- These days you are rarely seen.

527
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:05,832
- My marriage has been fixed.
- Here.

528
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:07,874
- What a shame.
- Get lost.

529
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:10,499
Aren't you ashamed to be a waiter?

530
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:12,082
Why should I be ashamed?

531
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:14,207
Your prince Charles is himself
serving sherbet to these rascals.

532
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:15,874
Oh God! Why?

533
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,707
What do you mean why?
It's sister-in-law's party.

534
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:20,832
She is your sister-in-law. And me?

535
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:22,749
You are also sister-in-law.

536
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,749
- And her?
- She's sister-in-law too.

537
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:28,082
As if your Kundan is a superstar..

538
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:31,082
That every girl would marry him.

539
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:34,207
Isn't he? Turn around.

540
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:09,165
""Someone's come before me.
And my heart's pounding.""

541
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:13,749
""Just a glimpse of
hers has driven me crazy.""

542
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,957
""Someone's come before me.
And my heart's pounding.""

543
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:23,415
""Just a glimpse of
hers has driven me crazy.""

544
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:28,249
""She will chat and meet me also.""

545
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,915
""She'll be friends
with me sooner or later.""

546
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:37,790
""Someone's come before me.
And my heart's pounding.""

547
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:42,790
""Just a glimpse of
hers has driven me crazy.""

548
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:53,040
Ordinary boys of lose their
love to a doctor or a engineer.

549
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,707
Don't be disheartened.

550
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:59,915
Murari, this is Banaras.

551
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:04,874
And if the ordinary boy loses
here as well, then he'll never win.

552
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:06,582
Is that so?

553
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:11,707
Mother. Please tell me.
Zoya will die, right?

554
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:18,457
Kundan will marry me, right?

555
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:22,540
Bindiya.

556
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:29,332
I will not do anything for you.
Spare me.

557
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:30,874
Listen, Bindiya.

558
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:33,957
You act so sweet
when you need a favor.

559
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:35,457
Otherwise you keep abusing me.

560
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:37,124
You're getting mad for no reason.

561
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,582
Aren't you my friend?

562
00:40:40,666 --> 00:40:42,624
Wait. Let me see. Hold on.

563
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:45,957
Mother, she should
do things for us, right?

564
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:48,040
- Look, she's saying yes. See.
- What do you want from me?

565
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:50,165
- Come here.
- Tell her the idea.

566
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:57,249
Yuck. Gross. Not at all.

567
00:40:57,333 --> 00:41:00,040
Bindiya, try to understand.

568
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,790
- I'm not doing anything for that wretch.
- Murari!

569
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:03,115
- Not at all.
- Murari, come on.

570
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:05,874
What's the matter?
Why are you shouting?

571
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:12,540
- Catch her.
- I'll never do it.

572
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:30,624
""Banarasi guy. Banarasi guy.""

573
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:38,082
""Banarasi guy.""

574
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,415
""ls there is a mess
up or are things messed up?""

575
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:46,165
""Banarasi guy. Banarasi guy.""

576
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:49,457
""Are we fighting together? Or are
we fighting because we are together.""

577
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:57,541
""Banarasi guy. Banarasi guy.""

578
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:07,374
""Banarasi guy.""

579
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:16,250
""Trickery is in the blood
of every man and woman here.""

580
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:28,957
""But they are innocent at heart.""

581
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:33,707
""They spend their lives
at the banks of Ganga.""

582
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:40,832
""Residents of the bank.""

583
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:49,250
""But Banarasi people have
an attitude all their own.""

584
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:30,999
""ls there is a mess
up or are things messed up.""

585
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:36,665
""Are we fighting together? Or are
we fighting because we are together.""

586
00:43:37,708 --> 00:43:45,708
""They are capable of anything
when it comes to them.""

587
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:58,707
""They chomp on some betel nut leaf..""

588
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:03,499
""..and walk around proudly.""

589
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:09,415
""Proud Banarasi.""

590
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:11,249
No. This is not possible.

591
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:13,707
I...I mean we're over
and done with this.

592
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:16,332
That's it. Okay. Yes.

593
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:24,583
""Proud Banarasi.""

594
00:44:30,416 --> 00:44:37,582
""ls there is a mess
up or are things messed up?""

595
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:45,457
""Are we fighting together? Or are
we fighting because we are together.""

596
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:54,083
""Banarasi guy. Banarasi guy.""

597
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:03,207
Great. Now that you
don't need me anymore..

598
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:04,915
You even don't recognize me.

599
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,124
I do. Of course.

600
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:09,371
Since I got you of this pickle,
won't I get a reward?

601
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:11,374
Absolutely. Tell me. What do you want?

602
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:14,832
Marry me, Zoya.

603
00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:19,499
Are you mad? No. Never.

604
00:45:21,416 --> 00:45:24,415
Okay. Look,
I bought this scooter for you.

605
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,790
But you never sat on it.

606
00:45:25,958 --> 00:45:27,624
You'll have to be my pillion.

607
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:29,207
You will have to hold me by my waist.

608
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:30,457
Not the stepney.

609
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:32,915
When I put on the breaks,
you'll have to fall on me.

610
00:45:33,083 --> 00:45:34,624
You will have to
laugh at things I say.

611
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:36,707
You will have to sing with me.

612
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,832
You can do this at least, right?

613
00:45:38,958 --> 00:45:41,749
At least let me feel it.
So be it if not as my girlfriend.

614
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:24,415
That day for the first
time I saw you so upset.

615
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,707
I was so scared.

616
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,457
Yes, I stepped over the line.

617
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:30,874
Okay, I swear.
I'll never ever get mad at you again.

618
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:33,165
Okay. I have something to say.

619
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,540
Go ahead.

620
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:38,790
Thank you. You saved my life.

621
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,499
I would've been dead otherwise.

622
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:41,957
Me too.

623
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:45,915
Come what may.
I would've never married that boy.

624
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:48,040
I love someone else.

625
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:51,999
I know. But you've never said it.

626
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:54,832
I am telling now. There is a boy.

627
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:57,374
He studies with me in Delhi JNU.

628
00:46:57,708 --> 00:47:00,915
I'll give up my life
if I don't marry him.

629
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:03,332
I love him a lot.

630
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:08,249
'Three years in Aligarh
had left me really weak, Kundan.'

631
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:11,082
'My confidence was
at an all time low.'

632
00:47:11,291 --> 00:47:14,124
'Leave the house meekly.
And come back meekly.'

633
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:17,582
'Every girl was trained
to be the ideal wife.'

634
00:47:17,916 --> 00:47:20,290
'Aunt was running a coaching
institute and not a house.'

635
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:22,957
'l was good at studies.
So teachers told..'

636
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:25,499
'..me that I should study in Delhi.'

637
00:47:25,583 --> 00:47:26,374
Vote for Aisha. Vote for Aisha.

638
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:27,207
'So, after a lot of struggle..'

639
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:28,499
'..l came to JNU,
after completing my 12th.'

640
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:30,665
'l had to repeat 9th again..'

641
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,790
'..due to which,
there was a gap year.'

642
00:47:33,458 --> 00:47:35,249
'l was having trouble
getting admission.'

643
00:47:35,416 --> 00:47:37,874
'l had adequate marks,
but couldn't get admission.'

644
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:39,832
'When I arrived at JNU,
it was election time.'

645
00:47:39,916 --> 00:47:40,999
Parveen, go from here. Wait there.

646
00:47:41,083 --> 00:47:43,165
- I wish to see Mr. Anand.
- I had asked you to do that.

647
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:44,082
Yes.

648
00:47:44,166 --> 00:47:46,124
Look, my marks are up to the mark.
But I am not getting admission.

649
00:47:46,208 --> 00:47:48,332
- Why?
- Because I took a year's break.

650
00:47:48,416 --> 00:47:50,915
Do this. Be there outside
VC's office tomorrow at 11.

651
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:52,446
- Tomorrow at 11.
- Okay. Please.

652
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,915
Did you call him or not?

653
00:47:59,791 --> 00:48:01,915
'That day I saw him
for the first time.'

654
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:05,624
'An ordinary guy in a pant and shirt.'

655
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:09,124
'He had innocence in his eyes.
But he was fearless.'

656
00:48:09,541 --> 00:48:11,165
'He came across like a born leader.'

657
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:13,707
'When I saw him
I felt something which..'

658
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:16,207
'..l had never felt in 21-22 years.'

659
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:19,249
'During the conversation,
he lost his cool a number of times.'

660
00:48:19,583 --> 00:48:21,707
'He banged on the table.
Threw things around.'

661
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:24,163
'But he never raised his voice.
Nor did he threaten.'

662
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:25,874
- And nor was he disrespectful.
- I'm talking to you.

663
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:27,915
- And the VC had to relent.
- Calm down.

664
00:48:28,291 --> 00:48:29,624
'And they got up,
and left just quietly.'

665
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:31,374
He wasn't as tough as he looked.

666
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:33,499
He readily agreed to all our demands.

667
00:48:33,875 --> 00:48:35,207
- Excuse me.
- Listen, come here.

668
00:48:35,416 --> 00:48:37,957
- Thank you.
- Aunty, that's great.

669
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:40,374
Could've said that with a smile.

670
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,415
'That was my first meeting with him.'

671
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:46,952
'After that, I saw on the
day of the election results.'

672
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:49,165
Catch. Stop there.

673
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:51,540
I said stop.

674
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,082
Catch him.

675
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:56,374
Catch him from that side.

676
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:01,207
Hi!

677
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:05,291
We won!

678
00:49:13,416 --> 00:49:15,540
So, we can stop running now.

679
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:17,624
Uncle, 3 cups of tea.

680
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:20,957
You can drink with
the President today.

681
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,624
Enjoy.

682
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:24,790
Consider that,
a farmer has four children.

683
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,874
And, there's a bowl of
porridge prepared in his home.

684
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:31,957
But, I say why not
make two bowls of porridge?

685
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:37,915
They'll say ""We've material
enough forjust one"".

686
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:41,499
I believe, the rest of
it is at the minister's home.

687
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:43,478
There's one thing I would like to say.

688
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:46,665
When the poor won't
have anything to eat..

689
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,457
They'll start eating the rich.

690
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:52,831
We didn't get our salaries.

691
00:49:52,833 --> 00:49:55,332
We didn't get our bonus,
it's been six months.

692
00:49:55,416 --> 00:49:56,832
How will we make a living?

693
00:49:56,916 --> 00:49:58,517
Everything will be resolved,
don't worry.

694
00:49:58,708 --> 00:50:01,832
War. War. American war.

695
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:05,124
American war.

696
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:07,457
America...

697
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:09,207
All of you sing really well.

698
00:50:09,458 --> 00:50:12,082
You should quit social
work and start a band.

699
00:50:12,291 --> 00:50:14,171
And madam,
you're so beautiful that you should..

700
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,665
Quit college and become an actress.

701
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,165
No. Don't say that.

702
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:19,999
Ever since this girl
has come to the university..

703
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:21,624
It seems more likeable, right?

704
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:23,874
You are right.

705
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:28,665
Escapism is the easiest
thing in this world.

706
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:36,915
I am dying to see Disneyland
and statue of liberty.

707
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:40,790
Choose between coca cola and pepsi.

708
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:44,957
I heard your speech at the seminar.

709
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:48,165
Do you actually think that
everyone in this world is equal?

710
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:52,040
I mean in a country like India
can you seriously overlook caste..

711
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:54,540
Culture, creed, community,
social and economic position..

712
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:57,082
Of every individual
and speak about equality.

713
00:50:57,166 --> 00:50:59,165
But I seriously think you
are over-romanticizing a situation..

714
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:01,290
Which needs a much
more logical approach.

715
00:51:05,666 --> 00:51:07,374
- What is your name?
- Zoya.

716
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:10,499
Zoya.

717
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:20,749
Even If I was a nobody,
you would still be wincing like this.

718
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,707
Every man in this
country is different.

719
00:51:24,041 --> 00:51:28,915
On caste,
creed, class... blah... blah...

720
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:32,790
This is the fact.

721
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:35,249
And I don't fight for facts, madam.

722
00:51:36,666 --> 00:51:38,582
I fight for what's right.

723
00:51:39,791 --> 00:51:41,540
- Sorry.
- Go to hell.

724
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:45,995
'This was happening to
me for the first time, Kundan.'

725
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,749
'Right from Banaras
to Aligarh to Delhi..'

726
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:51,790
'..this was the first man
who had treated me like that.'

727
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:55,874
'For him, I was like anyone else.'

728
00:51:56,208 --> 00:51:58,999
'Actually he proved what he said.'

729
00:52:32,166 --> 00:52:35,124
- I get scared in the examination hall.
- What else can happen?

730
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:36,582
How were the exams?

731
00:52:37,416 --> 00:52:39,499
Madam, I had apologized to you.

732
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:41,957
What will you get by failing me?

733
00:52:42,708 --> 00:52:46,540
Equality. You had chits to cheat.

734
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,165
The rest didn't.

735
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,790
Either come prepared next time..

736
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:52,156
Or distribute the chits
in the entire examination hall.

737
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:54,999
This is a fact and also justified.

738
00:52:56,375 --> 00:52:59,582
- Now have I proved my point?
- No.

739
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,790
I haven't kissed anybody
else in this college.

740
00:53:05,875 --> 00:53:07,915
This proves that you are privileged.

741
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:11,499
This proves that not everyone
in this world is equal.

742
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:18,207
It was like I had regained
my lost courage, Kundan.

743
00:53:18,708 --> 00:53:20,999
This was college. A new world.

744
00:53:21,083 --> 00:53:23,082
New people. New courage.

745
00:53:23,458 --> 00:53:24,290
And, new love!

746
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:29,332
âI'm only for you, I'm your world.""

747
00:53:29,875 --> 00:53:34,290
""You're so sweet, while I'm bitter.""

748
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:41,165
âI'm all yours, I'm your world.""

749
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:50,665
""The color red's so pure.""

750
00:53:50,958 --> 00:53:56,332
âIt's pure, it's filled with life.'

751
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,540
""You dwell in my heart now.""

752
00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:02,540
âI've found my beloved.""

753
00:54:02,625 --> 00:54:07,082
""Let no one cast an evil eye on you.""

754
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,374
""Curses to anyone who does.""

755
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:18,207
""My heart now belongs to you.""

756
00:54:18,291 --> 00:54:26,291
""Let no one cast an evil eye on you.""

757
00:54:32,541 --> 00:54:37,749
âI'm only for you, I'm your world.""

758
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:42,707
""You're so sweet, while I'm bitter.""

759
00:54:42,916 --> 00:54:46,165
âI'm all yours, I'm your world.""

760
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:51,749
âI'm all yours.""

761
00:55:00,416 --> 00:55:01,749
Kundan!

762
00:55:05,416 --> 00:55:06,915
What are you doing, Kundan?

763
00:55:19,541 --> 00:55:22,540
Kundan. Kundan.

764
00:55:38,666 --> 00:55:40,582
There will be no
electricity for three days.

765
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:42,540
Yeah, that's common with us too.

766
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:45,790
What happened? How did you get wet?

767
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:47,665
Did someone throw water on you?

768
00:55:47,875 --> 00:55:51,290
There's a boy here to see you.
Go inside and change.

769
00:55:51,625 --> 00:55:53,749
I'm serving food, get changed.

770
00:55:56,958 --> 00:55:58,124
You just sat down.

771
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:02,957
Get married. That's all we want.

772
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:06,040
- I don't want to.
- What do you mean you don't want to?

773
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:08,290
He was such a nice, well educated boy.

774
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,374
Well educated? They are
freaking half educated people.

775
00:56:11,875 --> 00:56:14,415
- What did you say?
- What do you want, mother?

776
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,999
Either you shouldn't
have sent me out of town..

777
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:17,249
Or given me such good education.

778
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:18,915
And since you have done so much..

779
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,601
The boy should
be of my choice, right?

780
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:24,999
Or should I marry an
uncouth boy like Kundan?

781
00:56:31,208 --> 00:56:33,790
This boy... was like Kundan?

782
00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:35,332
He has a big house. Big cars.

783
00:56:35,416 --> 00:56:36,999
What else does one need?

784
00:56:41,625 --> 00:56:43,832
I want a boy like me.

785
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:46,749
What do you mean by that?

786
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,707
- I love someone else.
- What?

787
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:06,290
- You call this cleaning? Sweep here.
- Yes.

788
00:57:06,375 --> 00:57:09,124
Murari, what's wrong with Kundan?
He is not talking to anyone.

789
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,249
Forget him.
Ask what is wrong the scooter.

790
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:13,957
He drove my brand new
scooter into the Ganges.

791
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:15,624
- I just took it to the mechanic.
- Don't know what happened?

792
00:57:15,708 --> 00:57:17,665
He says the entire
engine needs overhauling.

793
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,832
Kundan. What have you done!

794
00:57:22,125 --> 00:57:25,540
Kundan. Get up. Get up.

795
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:28,915
Get up.

796
00:57:32,041 --> 00:57:33,957
You think love is a joke?

797
00:57:34,041 --> 00:57:35,957
You slit your wrist
as when you feel like.

798
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,750
This seems more like UPSC
examination and not love.

799
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:40,082
You just can't pass it.

800
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:42,040
Zoya loves someone else.

801
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:45,540
To hell with your love.
To hell with Zoya.

802
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:47,624
Don't you cry like a sissy who has
lost his love in front of me.

803
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:49,707
And don't go to sleep.

804
00:57:50,041 --> 00:57:52,249
""Beloved. My beloved.""

805
00:57:52,333 --> 00:57:54,790
Tell me what the doctors said,

806
00:57:54,875 --> 00:57:57,275
Aunt, what do I know? I was
busy settling things with Ramesh.

807
00:57:57,291 --> 00:57:59,124
This is not the solution.

808
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:01,749
Listen, Mr.
Psychiatrist, are you done?

809
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:03,374
So leave.

810
00:58:03,666 --> 00:58:05,290
Don't use your brains too much.

811
00:58:06,291 --> 00:58:07,999
- Eat it.
- He's calling it suicide.

812
00:58:08,041 --> 00:58:10,415
As he said... He just... crazy.

813
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,624
He won't say that.

814
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:17,332
I had been to your house.

815
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,790
From there I came to
know that you are here.

816
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,332
Yes. You will find him here
if you don't find him at home.

817
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:26,430
He is in the hospital
if he is not at home.

818
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:29,332
- Murari.
- I want to talk to you.

819
00:58:32,916 --> 00:58:34,499
In private.

820
00:58:38,666 --> 00:58:40,707
Come, aunt. Let's go meet the doctor.

821
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,280
Ask him what you were asking me.

822
00:58:42,291 --> 00:58:44,332
Bindiya, come on. Come on.

823
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,874
Come with me.

824
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:51,249
Apples are 180 rupees a kilo.

825
00:58:51,458 --> 00:58:53,957
You get vitamins from me.
But you love them.

826
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:55,999
What a stubborn boy!

827
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:01,915
What a loser!

828
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:04,374
Explain to your friend.
She is a curse to us.

829
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:05,832
Keep quiet.

830
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:15,415
Zoya tried your number many times.

831
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,124
She said that she wants to meet you.

832
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:47,290
Zoya.

833
00:59:48,125 --> 00:59:52,290
I will give up my life
if these people force me, Kundan.

834
00:59:55,708 --> 00:59:58,874
- How did this happen?
- Nothing.

835
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,665
You slit your wrist again?

836
01:00:01,708 --> 01:00:03,707
How stupid can one be?

837
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:06,207
There is a limit to tolerance.

838
01:00:06,833 --> 01:00:08,832
Is this all you know to do?

839
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:11,374
I made a mistake when I was small.

840
01:00:11,583 --> 01:00:14,290
So are you going to
ruin my life for that?

841
01:00:15,708 --> 01:00:17,040
Come on.

842
01:00:17,666 --> 01:00:21,040
You want to marry, right?
This is all you want, right?

843
01:00:21,291 --> 01:00:23,124
Let the world go to hell.

844
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:26,124
What happened? Come on.

845
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,290
Come on.

846
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:47,207
Don't you understand, Kundan?

847
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:51,582
You are a Hindu and I am Muslim.

848
01:00:51,875 --> 01:00:53,415
We are poles apart.

849
01:00:53,625 --> 01:00:56,124
You come to deliver
gas cylinder to our house.

850
01:00:56,458 --> 01:00:59,749
Father likes you.
So he gives the car for servicing.

851
01:01:00,291 --> 01:01:02,040
You carry mother's bag of grocery.

852
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:03,624
You get flour for us.

853
01:01:03,791 --> 01:01:08,290
This doesn't mean they'll
get their daughter married to you.

854
01:01:08,625 --> 01:01:11,290
I had imagined that you
would help me if not anyone else.

855
01:01:11,875 --> 01:01:14,249
But you turned out
to be my biggest enemy.

856
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:35,582
I have shed blood. You shed tears.

857
01:01:36,041 --> 01:01:39,332
This seems more like a
violent story than a love story.

858
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:45,457
Go. Go home. Have food. Go to sleep.

859
01:01:45,875 --> 01:01:49,999
I'll come up with something. Go. Go.

860
01:01:54,958 --> 01:01:56,374
What is your boyfriend's name?

861
01:01:56,541 --> 01:01:58,374
Should I call him Amitabh Bachchan?

862
01:02:00,166 --> 01:02:02,332
Akram. Akram Zaidi.

863
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:23,957
Kundan! At this hour?

864
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:32,541
Sir, the Hindu boy Zoya fell
in love with 8 years ago was me.

865
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:53,624
Because of whom you
distanced Zoya from yourself.

866
01:02:53,958 --> 01:02:55,374
It was me, sir.

867
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:03,415
I kept coming to your house
so that I get close to you.

868
01:03:03,625 --> 01:03:05,624
I kept working for you
like a servant hoping you would..

869
01:03:05,708 --> 01:03:07,124
Consider me family.

870
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:14,707
Only to elope with Zoya
when she returns one day.

871
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:16,457
What happened, Mr. Haider?

872
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,790
But your daughter
loves you a lot, sir.

873
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:22,457
She cares a great
deal about your honor.

874
01:03:22,958 --> 01:03:25,249
She had forgotten me 8 years ago.

875
01:03:26,416 --> 01:03:28,707
But the boy she loves so much.

876
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:32,415
She wants to marry
him with your consent only.

877
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:34,582
She could've eloped, sir.

878
01:03:34,666 --> 01:03:36,249
And no one could've done a thing.

879
01:03:37,166 --> 01:03:39,540
You wouldn't have found
anyone's collar to grab.

880
01:03:40,625 --> 01:03:42,290
And what problem do you have?

881
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:45,790
He is a Muslim boy from a good family.

882
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,665
He is well educated.
Not an uncouth like me.

883
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:00,790
What happened, pal?

884
01:04:00,875 --> 01:04:03,790
I am jacked up.
Now do you want to help me?

885
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:06,332
Get lost, moron.

886
01:04:06,416 --> 01:04:09,207
- One by one.
- Yes, I am giving. Hold on.

887
01:04:09,375 --> 01:04:11,749
Now I won't give. Back up. Back up.

888
01:04:16,375 --> 01:04:18,207
She is here. Go.

889
01:04:19,416 --> 01:04:23,290
I think this has been
going for a bit too long.

890
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,207
I think you should end it.

891
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:26,790
Yes, I'm giving. Don't get desperate.

892
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,499
No. I am not. I've run out of it.

893
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:34,582
If you couldn't find sweets
you could've ordered something else.

894
01:04:35,458 --> 01:04:37,290
Thank you. Thank you so much.

895
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,665
Otherwise papa would've
never understood.

896
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,249
You made a fool out of me, Zoya.

897
01:04:51,166 --> 01:04:52,624
What do you think, Zoya?

898
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:56,415
You are some damsel.

899
01:04:57,416 --> 01:05:00,165
Loving you was my talent, Zoya.

900
01:05:00,583 --> 01:05:02,665
You don't deserve any credit for it.

901
01:05:04,125 --> 01:05:06,040
Even if it had been
anyone else instead of you..

902
01:05:06,166 --> 01:05:08,124
I would've loved herjust as much.

903
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,707
What do you think, Zoya?

904
01:05:12,291 --> 01:05:15,165
You are the only one in
the whole of Banaras for Kundan?

905
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:24,999
I will marry the day you marry.
Be it with a witch.

906
01:05:25,416 --> 01:05:27,499
I'll marry on that very day.
As far as your marriage goes..

907
01:05:27,583 --> 01:05:29,540
And I will do
everything I can in it.

908
01:05:30,916 --> 01:05:32,249
I would rather die.

909
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:36,540
But, I'll never utter your name again..

910
01:05:39,125 --> 01:05:40,665
Or, I'm a deadman.

911
01:05:54,208 --> 01:05:56,957
Look, forcing women is a crime.

912
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,624
Why don't you listen to me.

913
01:05:58,708 --> 01:06:01,124
Her father's a police officer,
we'll be jailed.

914
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:04,124
Don't create a scene.
You'll have to get a nose ring.

915
01:06:04,208 --> 01:06:06,874
- This crazy girl's troubling me.
- Mummy.

916
01:06:11,416 --> 01:06:12,665
- Bindiya.
- What is it?

917
01:06:14,208 --> 01:06:16,749
You were really fond
of marrying me, right?

918
01:06:17,791 --> 01:06:21,749
Tell your father. To call
the confectioner and the priest.

919
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,540
You're getting married to me.

920
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:26,457
On the 21st.

921
01:07:05,208 --> 01:07:09,582
""Tell me.
Tell me. What is this, my friend?""

922
01:07:09,666 --> 01:07:13,999
""Tell me.
Tell me. What is this mystery?""

923
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:18,749
""Tell me.
Tell me. What is this, my friend?""

924
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:23,040
""Tell me.
Tell me. What is this mystery?""

925
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:31,250
""What is this mystery?
Am I the mystery?""

926
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:08,749
""Everything changes in a flash.""

927
01:08:08,916 --> 01:08:12,999
âI have life long bond with her.""

928
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,457
""At times it seems populated.
And at times deserted.""

929
01:08:18,541 --> 01:08:26,541
""There can be no marriage
without friends.""

930
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:56,415
""He can plunge me into darkness.""

931
01:08:56,500 --> 01:09:00,957
""Or light up my life.""

932
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,665
""He can plunge me into darkness.""

933
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:10,207
""Or light up my life.""

934
01:09:10,916 --> 01:09:15,332
âI cherish weird dreams.""

935
01:09:15,416 --> 01:09:23,416
""There is no season
without your beloved.""

936
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:36,750
""He makes torments
me when he is with me.""

937
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:42,249
""He is nowhere to be seen
even though he is near me.""

938
01:09:42,375 --> 01:09:46,749
""When he is near me, he jinxes me.""

939
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:54,958
""My desires always stay with him.""

940
01:09:56,416 --> 01:10:00,874
âI do everything in my power for him.""

941
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:09,000
""And there are no
friends without mates.""

942
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,624
What happened, pal?

943
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:35,874
A lover doesn't get petrified
when his love is about to get married.

944
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,457
He gets petrified when
he is about to get married.

945
01:10:40,208 --> 01:10:43,249
Let him cry. It is his doing.

946
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:56,374
Enough. Stop. Stop.

947
01:10:58,416 --> 01:11:01,874
Why is this happening with me, Murari?

948
01:11:05,291 --> 01:11:07,749
One minute. One minute, Kundan.

949
01:11:10,583 --> 01:11:11,999
What the..

950
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:16,124
- Yes, I am fine.
- Take a look.

951
01:11:28,916 --> 01:11:31,999
Kundan. Kundan, you are mad.
Listen to me.

952
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:34,290
Kundan, where are you going?

953
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:36,415
Kundan, where are you going?
Are you mad?

954
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:58,290
I won't be able to eat all that.

955
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:01,999
Kundan. What happened?

956
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:06,982
Complete it.

957
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:20,040
Kundan, what happened?

958
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:31,207
I learnt at least that in your love.

959
01:12:32,541 --> 01:12:34,290
You should've taught him something.

960
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,499
What's happening?

961
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:43,165
What happened?

962
01:12:54,625 --> 01:12:55,915
He is Hindu.

963
01:13:12,416 --> 01:13:14,290
'And with that incident..'

964
01:13:14,375 --> 01:13:15,665
'..this beautiful
chapter came to an end.'

965
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:16,790
'It was time to wage war.'

966
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:19,749
'All hail Lord Ram.'

967
01:13:25,166 --> 01:13:33,166
""No one's a kin..""

968
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:41,624
Kundan, what are you doing?

969
01:13:41,958 --> 01:13:43,457
Zoya has slit her wrist.

970
01:13:43,541 --> 01:13:44,790
There was blood
all over the house.

971
01:13:44,875 --> 01:13:46,790
She's been taken to a hospital.
Let's go.

972
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,957
- Which hospital has she been taken too?
- The one at Hanuman Fatak.

973
01:13:51,041 --> 01:13:51,915
- And, the boy Akram?
- Hey.

974
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,999
He was badly beaten up.
They smashed his head.

975
01:13:54,041 --> 01:13:56,082
And, these boys
dumped him somewhere.

976
01:13:57,041 --> 01:13:59,415
Don't try to act smart with us.

977
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:01,165
It wasn't me.

978
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,040
It was Nawaz and Guddu.

979
01:14:03,416 --> 01:14:05,374
I left from the
Kent Railway Station.

980
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:06,790
They were still beating him up.

981
01:14:08,458 --> 01:14:09,415
Stay in your senses.

982
01:14:12,375 --> 01:14:13,332
Kundan!

983
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,040
He was my brother.

984
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:26,249
- Akram!
- Akram!

985
01:14:26,333 --> 01:14:27,499
Jasjeet!

986
01:14:29,458 --> 01:14:30,957
- Jasjeet!
- Jasjeet!

987
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:34,082
Murari.. Jasjeet!

988
01:14:34,166 --> 01:14:35,165
Jasjeet!

989
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:38,040
Oh no!

990
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:41,499
Jasjeet!

991
01:14:42,583 --> 01:14:44,503
- Jasjeet! Jasjeet!
- They really thrashed me up.

992
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,499
- Lift him up.
- Jasjeet.

993
01:15:00,833 --> 01:15:01,665
Doctor!

994
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:03,874
He's fine now.

995
01:15:08,666 --> 01:15:09,540
I'll be back soon.

996
01:15:14,041 --> 01:15:15,290
She's better now.

997
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,165
But, she's lost lot of blood.

998
01:15:26,708 --> 01:15:28,348
Weren't you getting
married today as well?

999
01:15:31,208 --> 01:15:35,249
Oh no! Darn it!

1000
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:46,665
You go alone, Pal.

1001
01:15:47,208 --> 01:15:48,582
I cannot face this.

1002
01:15:58,458 --> 01:15:59,415
He's here.

1003
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:03,457
- The bridegroom came.
- Okay.

1004
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:28,665
He's here.

1005
01:16:39,541 --> 01:16:42,332
Why did you do such a terrible
thing with this girl?

1006
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:45,290
Move.

1007
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:51,415
Get out of this house.
Don't ever show me your face again.

1008
01:17:54,333 --> 01:17:56,082
I knew it all the time.

1009
01:17:58,416 --> 01:18:00,290
But, it was too late.

1010
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:05,624
Wouldn't have made a difference.

1011
01:18:07,458 --> 01:18:11,124
The Delhi government
couldn't lay a finger on me.

1012
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:17,457
But, a girl got me messed up.

1013
01:18:19,625 --> 01:18:21,374
Same with me.

1014
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:27,624
Like a fool, I did as she said.

1015
01:18:30,333 --> 01:18:33,957
You should never pay
heed to a girl's suggestions.

1016
01:18:36,125 --> 01:18:38,290
There's lot of
work I still got to do.

1017
01:18:39,416 --> 01:18:40,957
If I don't get well soon..

1018
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:43,957
Who's going to raise
his voice in the Parliament.

1019
01:18:44,791 --> 01:18:49,332
What line had we thought
of telling to this champ here?

1020
01:18:49,416 --> 01:18:50,999
- What was it?
- My, my, your principals..

1021
01:18:51,041 --> 01:18:53,915
- My, my. Your principals.
- These ideologies.

1022
01:18:54,125 --> 01:18:55,790
These ideologies.

1023
01:18:55,875 --> 01:18:57,790
You can't get one time meal..

1024
01:18:59,041 --> 01:19:02,124
These things can't
get you even one time meal.

1025
01:19:03,208 --> 01:19:07,332
And the rallies you have on streets
and the slogans and all.

1026
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,540
This is not going
to be of any use. Got it?

1027
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:17,457
Join our party.
True happiness is in being in power.

1028
01:19:17,916 --> 01:19:19,624
You hail from Jalandhar, right?

1029
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:21,438
I'll get a ticket
from Jalandhar area.

1030
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:25,582
Anand, what had we
thought of replying to Mr. Gupta?

1031
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:27,207
First go and get
the sign of the man...

1032
01:19:27,291 --> 01:19:28,374
Yes.

1033
01:19:28,458 --> 01:19:31,624
First go and get the sign of
the man whom you have been fooling..

1034
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,165
For the last 60 years.

1035
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:38,249
And then I'm ready to sign
any paper you give me, Mr. Gupta.

1036
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:41,505
Why will we fight
the elections from Jalandhar..

1037
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,499
When we can win from Delhi.

1038
01:19:43,916 --> 01:19:45,915
We'll fight.
And create our own party.

1039
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:47,457
Thank you for the offer, sir.

1040
01:19:51,916 --> 01:19:53,332
And sir, you are right.

1041
01:19:53,541 --> 01:19:54,957
Real happiness
is in being in power.

1042
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:57,415
The rest is rubbish.

1043
01:19:59,666 --> 01:20:01,332
- Did you saw that?
- Yes.

1044
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:10,415
""We're boys of free will.""

1045
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:14,874
""We can ride the winds as well.""

1046
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:19,707
""The path of love,
is a difficult one.""

1047
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:25,957
""Be brave... give
me your heart without a care.""

1048
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:31,165
""Learn to be faithful from us.""

1049
01:20:31,708 --> 01:20:35,957
""Get some fresh air from us.""

1050
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,165
""The stories of the heart.
The days in our share.""

1051
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:51,499
""Can only be
spent from the heart.""

1052
01:20:51,583 --> 01:20:58,999
""Get rid of all the fears.""

1053
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:07,958
""Forget the worries.
Destroy the fears.""

1054
01:21:09,166 --> 01:21:11,707
""Sweetheart, come with me.""

1055
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:15,624
""Come,
the world of dreams awaits you.""

1056
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:23,708
""The one who is alive in the
true sense can conquer the world.""

1057
01:21:24,458 --> 01:21:29,374
""He will breathe freely.""

1058
01:21:29,458 --> 01:21:33,790
""Learn to be faithful from us.""

1059
01:21:33,875 --> 01:21:38,124
""Get some fresh air from us.""

1060
01:21:38,333 --> 01:21:42,915
""Learn to be faithful from us.""

1061
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,832
""Get some fresh air from us.""

1062
01:21:47,916 --> 01:21:52,665
""Join the path of truth.""

1063
01:21:58,541 --> 01:22:00,665
- Let's go everyone, to the big house.
- How's everything? All okay?

1064
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:03,540
- Mr. Salim, how are you?
- Great.

1065
01:22:03,708 --> 01:22:04,708
You came here personally.

1066
01:22:04,833 --> 01:22:07,233
You've done such a thing
that we have to come time and again.

1067
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:08,374
Aunt?

1068
01:22:08,458 --> 01:22:10,040
Good to see you, Seema.
I'm coming back tomorrow.

1069
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:11,457
We've such immense pressure
from our seniors to arrest you.

1070
01:22:11,541 --> 01:22:13,290
We have been sent to arrest you.

1071
01:22:13,583 --> 01:22:15,582
- How is everyone at home?
- Great.

1072
01:22:15,666 --> 01:22:17,457
- Officer, you too are here.
- Yes.

1073
01:22:17,541 --> 01:22:19,040
Where are you going, sir?

1074
01:22:19,083 --> 01:22:20,374
Come. Let me show you the jail.

1075
01:22:20,458 --> 01:22:22,915
No. No. Good for you, sir.

1076
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:26,040
What can I do if I'm
destined to marry a criminal?

1077
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:28,499
Excuse me.

1078
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:31,915
What criminal, madam?

1079
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:33,832
I am about to be the CM.

1080
01:22:34,041 --> 01:22:37,040
And if lady luck shines on me,
then I'll be the PM some day.

1081
01:22:37,958 --> 01:22:39,079
This is the chance you have.

1082
01:22:39,208 --> 01:22:41,999
If you marry me,
your life will be risk free.

1083
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:45,040
Or carry on with your
street plays in Dariaganj.

1084
01:22:45,083 --> 01:22:47,957
I see. And who'll ask my parents?

1085
01:22:48,125 --> 01:22:51,790
Parents? If you say,
I can ask the entire nation.

1086
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:55,582
I will announce it
from Red Fort on 15th August.

1087
01:22:56,291 --> 01:22:59,374
Bye. Let's go, sir.

1088
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:03,290
Injustice won't be tolerated.
Injustice won't be tolerated.

1089
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:07,082
""Let's see if your
jail's can hold us.""

1090
01:23:07,166 --> 01:23:11,124
""Let's see if you
really got the guts.""

1091
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:14,999
""Let's see if your
jail's can hold us.""

1092
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:22,707
After that, Zoya left for Beneras.

1093
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:26,040
She called few days ago.

1094
01:23:26,166 --> 01:23:27,540
Are you insane?

1095
01:23:27,708 --> 01:23:28,790
Who's going to put up this act?

1096
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:30,540
Just spare a week for me, please.

1097
01:23:30,625 --> 01:23:31,707
Everything will be fine.

1098
01:23:31,833 --> 01:23:34,707
Zoya, this is nonsense.
I've too much left to do.

1099
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:37,582
Everything was fine.

1100
01:23:38,291 --> 01:23:39,624
Everything under control.

1101
01:23:41,875 --> 01:23:42,790
And now...

1102
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,040
Everything's shattered.

1103
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,207
Father, this is Kundan.

1104
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,415
He saved brother.

1105
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:09,582
Otherwise, brother wouldn't
have made it alive..

1106
01:24:09,666 --> 01:24:10,874
From the accident.

1107
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:18,165
Thank you son,
you've been a big help.

1108
01:24:19,041 --> 01:24:21,082
But, we don't
understand a thing here,

1109
01:24:21,958 --> 01:24:23,540
We're taking him back to Punjab.

1110
01:24:23,833 --> 01:24:24,915
He's lost a lot of blood.

1111
01:24:25,041 --> 01:24:26,481
But, there's nothing to worry about.

1112
01:24:32,083 --> 01:24:33,290
I'll need a tempo.

1113
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:36,624
What's cooking in your mind now?

1114
01:24:37,333 --> 01:24:39,207
And, two train tickets to Punjab.

1115
01:24:39,666 --> 01:24:40,624
Tickets?

1116
01:24:40,916 --> 01:24:42,165
What for?

1117
01:24:43,958 --> 01:24:46,707
Elope! With Zoya.

1118
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:48,999
Tonight.

1119
01:24:49,666 --> 01:24:51,457
Have you lost it, Pal?

1120
01:24:51,666 --> 01:24:53,165
You think Zoya will come with you.

1121
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:54,957
I'll just take her to Jasjeet.

1122
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:57,790
You'll get yourself killed.
She'll never take a favor from you.

1123
01:24:57,875 --> 01:24:59,249
I don't have a choice.

1124
01:24:59,333 --> 01:25:01,165
Kundan, there's a limit to..

1125
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:13,457
Just do as I'm saying..

1126
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:06,499
Jasjeet's fine.

1127
01:26:07,541 --> 01:26:10,540
He's hurt, but fine.

1128
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,832
His parents took him back home.

1129
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:21,332
I made a big mistake.

1130
01:26:23,541 --> 01:26:24,999
But, I swear..

1131
01:26:25,541 --> 01:26:30,082
I'll take you to Jasjeet.

1132
01:26:33,416 --> 01:26:34,124
What?

1133
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:29,290
""The one you're searching for,
dwells in your heart.""

1134
01:27:29,541 --> 01:27:34,582
""There's a sea inside you,
stop looking for droplets.""

1135
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:39,874
""The one you're searching for,
dwells in your heart.""

1136
01:27:40,083 --> 01:27:45,207
""There's a sea inside you,
stop looking for droplets.""

1137
01:27:45,375 --> 01:27:53,375
""Clear all your doubts.""

1138
01:27:55,958 --> 01:27:58,249
""Lift the veil.""

1139
01:27:58,333 --> 01:28:03,415
""Beloved.""

1140
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:11,500
""You will see your beloved.""

1141
01:28:14,375 --> 01:28:19,540
""The one you're searching for,
dwells in your heart.""

1142
01:28:19,625 --> 01:28:24,665
""There's a sea inside you,
stop looking for droplets.""

1143
01:28:24,958 --> 01:28:32,832
""Clear all your doubts.""

1144
01:28:32,916 --> 01:28:35,082
""Lift the veil.""

1145
01:28:35,166 --> 01:28:43,166
""You will see your beloved.""

1146
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:58,625
""No point in
seeing what others do.""

1147
01:29:01,166 --> 01:29:09,166
""Try to see what the others can.""

1148
01:29:11,916 --> 01:29:17,540
""You can't see
with the naked eye.""

1149
01:29:17,625 --> 01:29:22,582
""Close your eyes,
and you can see it.""

1150
01:29:22,666 --> 01:29:28,165
""You will see your beloved.""

1151
01:30:17,958 --> 01:30:23,040
""You don't always
get what you want.""

1152
01:30:23,125 --> 01:30:28,415
""My companion is only my shadow.""

1153
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:34,124
""You robbed me of my heart.""

1154
01:30:34,458 --> 01:30:39,290
""Yet you whisper softly.""

1155
01:30:39,375 --> 01:30:47,375
""You will see your beloved.""

1156
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:55,207
""The one you're searching for,
dwells in your heart.""

1157
01:30:55,541 --> 01:31:00,707
""There's a sea inside you,
stop looking for droplets.""

1158
01:31:00,791 --> 01:31:08,791
""Clear all your doubts.""

1159
01:31:11,375 --> 01:31:13,624
""Lift the veil.""

1160
01:31:13,708 --> 01:31:18,874
""Beloved.""

1161
01:31:18,958 --> 01:31:24,207
""You will see your beloved.""

1162
01:31:36,666 --> 01:31:37,749
Go away.

1163
01:31:42,041 --> 01:31:50,041
""You will see your beloved.""

1164
01:31:52,958 --> 01:31:57,874
""The one you're searching for,
dwells in your heart.""

1165
01:31:58,208 --> 01:32:03,457
""There's a sea inside you,
stop looking for droplets.""

1166
01:32:37,416 --> 01:32:39,874
Bring it, dear. Baba will bless you.

1167
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:42,999
Hey. Priest. Leave.

1168
01:32:43,208 --> 01:32:44,874
Go on. Go.

1169
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,915
You know,
many of the sages here are cheats.

1170
01:32:54,375 --> 01:32:55,874
Castouts.

1171
01:32:56,250 --> 01:32:57,540
Bloody criminals.

1172
01:32:58,291 --> 01:32:59,665
Murderer, rapists.

1173
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:02,374
They just dawn the saffron color..

1174
01:33:02,625 --> 01:33:04,582
And mingle along
with the real ones.

1175
01:33:09,166 --> 01:33:10,790
Whom did you kill?

1176
01:33:14,875 --> 01:33:16,457
I can see it on your face.

1177
01:33:18,041 --> 01:33:25,207
No faith in this world
can pardon a murderer.

1178
01:33:27,958 --> 01:33:29,790
Go. Do something.

1179
01:33:32,041 --> 01:33:33,415
Don't know what?

1180
01:33:34,458 --> 01:33:40,040
But, you won't get salvation
at the banks of Ganges.

1181
01:33:51,833 --> 01:33:53,499
- Hello.
- Murari.

1182
01:33:53,583 --> 01:33:55,665
Where are you?

1183
01:33:56,125 --> 01:33:58,124
I've been thinking about you.

1184
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:02,290
- Is Zoya in Beneras?
- In Beneras? Is she?

1185
01:34:02,458 --> 01:34:04,249
That's exactly what
I'm asking. Is she?

1186
01:34:04,458 --> 01:34:05,874
Rascal, you eloped with her.

1187
01:34:05,958 --> 01:34:07,665
Do you know the chaos it led to?

1188
01:34:07,916 --> 01:34:09,237
What are you doing?
Where are you?

1189
01:34:09,291 --> 01:34:10,249
And, where's Zoya?

1190
01:34:18,208 --> 01:34:20,832
""Seeking him. Feeling him.""

1191
01:34:20,916 --> 01:34:23,957
""Either its you, or its him.""

1192
01:34:26,166 --> 01:34:28,707
""Seeking him. Feeling him.""

1193
01:34:28,833 --> 01:34:31,707
""Either its you, or its him.""

1194
01:34:34,041 --> 01:34:40,082
""Without him, everything's vain.""

1195
01:34:42,083 --> 01:34:50,083
""You will see your beloved.""

1196
01:34:59,583 --> 01:35:01,457
People look, stare at you.

1197
01:35:01,625 --> 01:35:05,582
Humiliate you with their stare.
Disrobe you.

1198
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:07,499
And say ""We're just looking"".

1199
01:35:09,916 --> 01:35:11,999
They whistle, sing songs..

1200
01:35:12,041 --> 01:35:16,165
And tell their friends about it,
show-off that they're men.

1201
01:35:17,125 --> 01:35:19,624
And say, ""We were just looking,
it's not a crime"".

1202
01:35:20,583 --> 01:35:28,583
""Are you alive?""

1203
01:35:32,791 --> 01:35:34,040
Is everyone here?

1204
01:35:34,125 --> 01:35:36,249
- Zoya, let's go.
- Yes, drive this vehicle.

1205
01:36:00,541 --> 01:36:03,457
- What's wrong?
- Just a second.

1206
01:36:05,375 --> 01:36:06,290
Hey!

1207
01:36:07,666 --> 01:36:09,040
What are you doing?

1208
01:36:10,041 --> 01:36:11,540
- Hey.
- Hey.

1209
01:36:11,958 --> 01:36:13,415
We had to wrestle the management..

1210
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:14,915
To install that pipe.

1211
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,499
Don't break it.

1212
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:19,915
Who are you? What're you doing?

1213
01:36:20,166 --> 01:36:21,957
And, why are you
climbing up the pipe?

1214
01:36:23,875 --> 01:36:26,540
I...am a thief.

1215
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:28,707
I was here to steal.

1216
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,290
Why don't we turn him in?

1217
01:36:31,375 --> 01:36:35,124
That will mean we believe
in this administration system.

1218
01:36:35,208 --> 01:36:37,082
I know,
it's a completely ruthless..

1219
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:38,915
And a politically
aggressive system.

1220
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,082
Correct.
And, we should be against it.

1221
01:36:41,166 --> 01:36:43,499
He's a victim
of this system as well.

1222
01:36:43,583 --> 01:36:45,582
Samosa (Fritters).

1223
01:36:46,583 --> 01:36:47,874
Two Samosas.

1224
01:36:49,166 --> 01:36:50,332
Samosa?

1225
01:36:51,250 --> 01:36:53,124
Chotu. Samosas.

1226
01:36:53,666 --> 01:36:54,790
Two.

1227
01:36:55,041 --> 01:36:57,624
So, we need to understand..

1228
01:36:57,833 --> 01:37:00,124
Why would anyone become a thief.

1229
01:37:00,208 --> 01:37:01,832
Why did you become one?

1230
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,499
Because... I'm poor.

1231
01:37:11,416 --> 01:37:13,332
Water..

1232
01:37:14,583 --> 01:37:16,457
Tea...

1233
01:37:17,958 --> 01:37:20,582
Poverty is a result
of over-population.

1234
01:37:21,125 --> 01:37:23,124
Don't simplify things.

1235
01:37:23,416 --> 01:37:26,499
Over-population is a
result of lack of education.

1236
01:37:26,583 --> 01:37:28,374
But, lower-classes
don't have resources..

1237
01:37:28,458 --> 01:37:29,332
To educate their children.

1238
01:37:29,416 --> 01:37:30,415
No, no. One minute.

1239
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:32,374
Even the educated
youth in this country..

1240
01:37:32,458 --> 01:37:33,915
Are suffering from unemployment.

1241
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,165
- I agree.
- No. I am sorry.

1242
01:37:35,250 --> 01:37:37,624
- Becoming a thief cannot be justified.
- She is also right.

1243
01:37:37,708 --> 01:37:39,165
He's asleep.

1244
01:37:46,083 --> 01:37:48,207
Bro. Bro.

1245
01:37:56,041 --> 01:38:01,499
- We know why you became a thief.
- Why?

1246
01:38:01,833 --> 01:38:05,499
- Because you're poor.
- And you don't have a job. Right?

1247
01:38:08,875 --> 01:38:09,790
Yes.

1248
01:38:10,041 --> 01:38:13,915
I'm poor, and I don't have a job.

1249
01:38:14,291 --> 01:38:15,957
Kundan, get a cup of tea.

1250
01:38:17,125 --> 01:38:18,665
Give me a cold drink.

1251
01:38:38,291 --> 01:38:39,612
Go ahead, I'll be right with you.

1252
01:38:47,375 --> 01:38:48,499
What now?

1253
01:38:52,583 --> 01:38:56,624
I'd rather work myself
to death here, than die of guilt.

1254
01:38:58,166 --> 01:39:01,040
And, I don't know why I'm here.

1255
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:07,124
Let me stay here. Please.

1256
01:39:13,125 --> 01:39:14,540
Nothing's changed.

1257
01:39:14,875 --> 01:39:17,499
Jasjeet's 'All India
Citizen's Party'..

1258
01:39:17,916 --> 01:39:20,082
Will still run in
the upcoming elections.

1259
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:22,415
His hard work can't go to waste.

1260
01:39:23,833 --> 01:39:26,540
I nominate Zoya as the new leader.

1261
01:39:27,041 --> 01:39:29,374
Those who agree, raise your hands.

1262
01:39:35,041 --> 01:39:37,082
So, we need to decide what's next.

1263
01:39:40,625 --> 01:39:42,124
We should do something..

1264
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:43,290
About the 'Bhatta Parsal' scam.

1265
01:39:43,375 --> 01:39:46,665
Around 4000 farmers
are losing their lands.

1266
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:48,249
Only to put up a factory.

1267
01:39:48,583 --> 01:39:50,249
The media must be present as well.

1268
01:39:51,708 --> 01:39:53,832
We can gain a lot
of political mileage.

1269
01:39:54,083 --> 01:39:56,832
Fine. Let's meet
here tomorrow at 11am.

1270
01:39:59,250 --> 01:40:01,290
The girl's got the spark.

1271
01:40:01,458 --> 01:40:03,124
We'll teach her the rest.

1272
01:40:03,208 --> 01:40:05,707
These are the basic
things in politics.

1273
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:12,582
- Zoya.
- I don't care a damn if he lives or dies.

1274
01:40:12,916 --> 01:40:14,874
There's nothing to
discuss about him, Rashmi.

1275
01:40:15,375 --> 01:40:18,374
There's much left to
do, and he doesn't exist for me.

1276
01:40:27,666 --> 01:40:30,040
Come on, give the tea.

1277
01:40:50,583 --> 01:40:58,583
""Don't look at me... like that.""

1278
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:13,000
""Like you never saw me before.""

1279
01:41:15,916 --> 01:41:19,499
He'll never learn.
Where are you going? Stop Kundan.

1280
01:41:19,583 --> 01:41:27,583
""Don't look at me... like that.""

1281
01:41:35,125 --> 01:41:39,290
Load all the flags.

1282
01:41:41,708 --> 01:41:43,540
Anand.

1283
01:41:44,041 --> 01:41:46,915
- Take me along.
- What will you possibly do, Kundan?

1284
01:41:47,166 --> 01:41:48,957
Lend a helping hand.

1285
01:41:49,250 --> 01:41:53,040
- Or, serve you all tea.
- Climb on.

1286
01:42:09,375 --> 01:42:11,040
Come on. Who else?

1287
01:42:11,166 --> 01:42:12,249
Stand straight.

1288
01:42:12,416 --> 01:42:14,665
Don't let anyone come this side.

1289
01:42:14,791 --> 01:42:15,665
Be ready.

1290
01:42:15,791 --> 01:42:18,499
Shoot anyone you see. Get that.

1291
01:42:18,583 --> 01:42:20,040
No one.. Stand straight.

1292
01:42:20,625 --> 01:42:22,332
We're ready to talk.

1293
01:42:22,416 --> 01:42:25,124
Let us talk to your headman.

1294
01:42:25,458 --> 01:42:27,665
- The government will talk to you.
- You stay here.

1295
01:42:27,875 --> 01:42:30,957
- Who are you?
- What about the extra forces?

1296
01:42:31,125 --> 01:42:32,246
We want to meet the farmers?

1297
01:42:32,375 --> 01:42:35,249
Farmers? Who are you?

1298
01:42:35,333 --> 01:42:37,457
- Get lost!
- You cannot stop us.

1299
01:42:37,791 --> 01:42:39,374
Our party's running
for elections this year.

1300
01:42:39,458 --> 01:42:40,874
We're here to meet the
people of our constituency.

1301
01:42:40,958 --> 01:42:45,207
Ma'am. They've
kidnapped a PSE soldier.

1302
01:42:45,291 --> 01:42:47,290
And, they shot at
the DM's leg yesterday.

1303
01:42:47,375 --> 01:42:50,249
If they don't return that soldier,
they'll be shot.

1304
01:42:50,333 --> 01:42:52,665
You've an excuse to shoot them.

1305
01:42:52,791 --> 01:42:54,540
It's a golden opportunity
for this corrupt government..

1306
01:42:54,625 --> 01:42:55,746
To take away their lands.

1307
01:42:55,791 --> 01:42:57,165
You're raising your
voice at the wrong place.

1308
01:42:57,250 --> 01:42:58,040
Get that.

1309
01:42:58,416 --> 01:42:59,290
SP sir came.

1310
01:43:00,208 --> 01:43:02,707
Come on. Get lost.

1311
01:43:03,291 --> 01:43:05,915
- What's the position?
- The position's really bad.

1312
01:43:06,083 --> 01:43:09,540
Sir, we've seized the entire area.

1313
01:43:10,875 --> 01:43:14,624
Look. I give you five minutes..

1314
01:43:14,708 --> 01:43:16,249
The farmers were wrong.

1315
01:43:16,458 --> 01:43:17,698
They just gave the government..

1316
01:43:17,791 --> 01:43:19,040
An excuse to shoot them.

1317
01:43:19,125 --> 01:43:21,125
They'll just target the
main leaders and kill them.

1318
01:43:21,291 --> 01:43:22,957
And the government will say..

1319
01:43:23,125 --> 01:43:25,249
""We were only trying
to save the PSE soldier"".

1320
01:43:26,583 --> 01:43:28,665
The people will blame the farmers.

1321
01:43:30,041 --> 01:43:31,582
We'll have to talk to the SP.

1322
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:33,915
- Anand.
- Yeah!

1323
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:36,874
Talk to the media. Tell them
about the situation going on here.

1324
01:43:37,166 --> 01:43:39,165
We'll have to take harsh action.

1325
01:43:39,708 --> 01:43:41,124
Sir, we know what
you're trying to do here.

1326
01:43:41,208 --> 01:43:42,499
We tried talking to them sir,
but they aren't listening, sir.

1327
01:43:42,583 --> 01:43:43,790
Sir, excuse me sir!

1328
01:43:44,333 --> 01:43:46,293
I know you must be following
your seniors orders..

1329
01:43:46,416 --> 01:43:47,540
But, you cannot do this.

1330
01:43:47,625 --> 01:43:50,165
Actually, I can do anything I want.

1331
01:43:50,375 --> 01:43:52,165
I can have you all arrested.

1332
01:43:54,458 --> 01:43:56,374
- Don't do this. Behave yourself.
- Move back.

1333
01:43:56,458 --> 01:43:59,040
- Please don't do this.
- Let us talk to them.

1334
01:43:59,083 --> 01:44:00,707
- This is the last warning for you.
- Move aside.

1335
01:44:00,833 --> 01:44:02,249
Sir, sir!

1336
01:44:03,083 --> 01:44:05,165
- Let us go inside.
- Sir!

1337
01:44:06,333 --> 01:44:08,040
Sir, I think you are a Tamilian.

1338
01:44:08,083 --> 01:44:10,207
Please, tell them to stop.
Sir, please listen to me.

1339
01:44:10,375 --> 01:44:12,624
If you wish, you can grant me
5 minutes permission.

1340
01:44:12,708 --> 01:44:15,332
Sir, please show some
mercy on me. Please, sir.

1341
01:44:15,416 --> 01:44:17,499
Unlike you, even they have
parents and everyone.

1342
01:44:17,958 --> 01:44:20,540
Please, sir. Sir, just give me 5
minutes time I'll get them out somehow.

1343
01:44:20,625 --> 01:44:21,665
If not, then you can do anything.

1344
01:44:21,791 --> 01:44:22,624
Please, sir.

1345
01:44:22,958 --> 01:44:25,624
Okay. Stop! Stop!

1346
01:44:27,916 --> 01:44:32,082
Only 5 minutes.
Do whatever you can. Go.

1347
01:44:32,458 --> 01:44:33,332
Thank you.

1348
01:44:45,291 --> 01:44:46,540
Kundan, be careful.

1349
01:45:29,041 --> 01:45:31,040
Bravo.

1350
01:45:36,291 --> 01:45:38,374
Bro, What?

1351
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:41,832
What did you tell the farmers?

1352
01:45:43,625 --> 01:45:44,499
Nothing.

1353
01:45:45,583 --> 01:45:49,165
I said ""So you shot the DM,
that's alright"".

1354
01:45:49,375 --> 01:45:51,999
""But this soldier's a poor man.""

1355
01:45:52,166 --> 01:45:54,457
""His father's a farmer like you.""

1356
01:45:54,875 --> 01:45:57,624
""if he dies,
his mother will curse all of you.""

1357
01:45:57,708 --> 01:45:59,249
""And, you'll be ruined.""

1358
01:45:59,458 --> 01:46:02,082
""Your rivers will run dry.""

1359
01:46:02,166 --> 01:46:03,832
""Then you can keep your lands.""

1360
01:46:04,333 --> 01:46:05,207
That's all.

1361
01:46:05,333 --> 01:46:07,790
That scared them,
and they let him go.

1362
01:46:08,083 --> 01:46:09,523
How do you come up with such things?

1363
01:46:09,625 --> 01:46:11,165
I'm a Pandit!

1364
01:46:11,250 --> 01:46:14,624
This is how I've been
living in Beneras for years.

1365
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,832
- You're a rascal.
- Top class.

1366
01:46:17,916 --> 01:46:18,624
Yes.

1367
01:46:18,708 --> 01:46:23,040
- We will win!
- AICP will win!

1368
01:46:23,125 --> 01:46:27,124
Vote for.. AICP!

1369
01:46:27,208 --> 01:46:28,207
- Vote for..
- AICP!

1370
01:46:28,291 --> 01:46:31,249
- Vote for..
- AICP!

1371
01:46:31,333 --> 01:46:32,707
Come along, sister-in-law.

1372
01:46:38,958 --> 01:46:39,790
Stop hitting us.

1373
01:46:39,875 --> 01:46:41,540
Have you lost your mind?
Why are you hurling slippers at us.

1374
01:46:41,791 --> 01:46:43,832
- Are you guys mad?
- Don't set foot in here.

1375
01:46:44,166 --> 01:46:45,082
Get lost.

1376
01:46:45,625 --> 01:46:47,290
We just want to talk.

1377
01:46:47,708 --> 01:46:49,249
We're against this
government as well.

1378
01:46:49,333 --> 01:46:50,540
We've formed a new party.

1379
01:46:50,625 --> 01:46:53,374
New or old,
you're just a bunch of thieves.

1380
01:46:53,541 --> 01:46:55,790
After the elections,
no one will even take a peek here.

1381
01:46:55,958 --> 01:46:57,665
I'll be damned if anyone does.

1382
01:46:57,791 --> 01:46:59,040
We just want to help.

1383
01:46:59,125 --> 01:47:03,165
Mother Teresa.
We don't want your help. Get out!

1384
01:47:03,458 --> 01:47:05,082
These rascals are here to help.

1385
01:47:05,541 --> 01:47:06,874
Hey! Keep that spade down.

1386
01:47:06,958 --> 01:47:08,718
Pick it up again and
I'll beat you to a pulp.

1387
01:47:09,208 --> 01:47:14,415
Better get going, or else
I'll start throwing slippers at you.

1388
01:47:14,791 --> 01:47:17,457
And humiliate you to death.

1389
01:47:18,416 --> 01:47:20,874
- Kundan, where are you going?
- Just forget it.

1390
01:47:21,625 --> 01:47:23,582
- Hey, what's this?
- Hey.

1391
01:47:23,875 --> 01:47:24,832
Don't create a scene.

1392
01:47:25,458 --> 01:47:27,332
Or else I'll beat you.

1393
01:47:28,958 --> 01:47:32,040
You're such pathetic rascals,
to show this anger so late.

1394
01:47:33,583 --> 01:47:36,832
Thirty years ago, if your
father had shown the same anger..

1395
01:47:36,916 --> 01:47:38,999
You wouldn't have
been living in this shit.

1396
01:47:39,958 --> 01:47:42,915
Yes, we're here
to ask for your vote.

1397
01:47:43,583 --> 01:47:44,915
So what's wrong in that?

1398
01:47:45,833 --> 01:47:48,313
You've been giving your vote
for the last 60 years, aren't you?

1399
01:47:48,958 --> 01:47:50,665
So, this time give your vote to us.

1400
01:47:51,958 --> 01:47:52,957
What's going to happen?

1401
01:47:53,708 --> 01:47:56,332
At the most, you'll be the fool.

1402
01:47:56,875 --> 01:47:58,415
But, that you still are.

1403
01:48:01,041 --> 01:48:02,874
So, shall we leave..

1404
01:48:03,083 --> 01:48:05,124
Or pick up the
shovel and help you.

1405
01:48:19,541 --> 01:48:22,124
The AICP members...

1406
01:48:22,208 --> 01:48:25,249
'The media had made us heroes,
so did fate.'

1407
01:48:25,333 --> 01:48:27,040
'This is when I realised..'

1408
01:48:27,125 --> 01:48:29,457
'..there's a huge dearth
of leaders in our country.'

1409
01:48:29,708 --> 01:48:32,332
'lf they were listening
to a uncouth like me..'

1410
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:34,040
'..they would listen to anyone.'

1411
01:48:34,333 --> 01:48:37,165
'But, I wasn't concerned
about the country.'

1412
01:48:37,375 --> 01:48:39,999
'All I cared about was me.'

1413
01:48:40,541 --> 01:48:44,374
'l was thinking,
if I can impress these AICP kids..'

1414
01:48:44,458 --> 01:48:46,415
'..then someday,
she'll see the light as well.'

1415
01:48:46,583 --> 01:48:48,915
'But, Zoya didn't like me one bit.'

1416
01:48:49,125 --> 01:48:50,665
'l was walking ahead,
and people were following me.'

1417
01:48:50,958 --> 01:48:52,790
'l was getting on her nerves.'

1418
01:48:53,375 --> 01:48:54,832
'But, I didn't realize..'

1419
01:48:55,041 --> 01:48:57,207
'..when my success posed
a threat to the government.'

1420
01:48:57,291 --> 01:49:00,624
AICP party members nearly
escaped from being badly beaten.

1421
01:49:00,708 --> 01:49:04,374
After the Bhatta Parsal incident,
this is another victory..

1422
01:49:04,458 --> 01:49:07,374
For AICP's youth
party in Sheelampur area.

1423
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:09,415
There's less than a
month for the elections.

1424
01:49:10,333 --> 01:49:12,040
They're gaining good mileage.

1425
01:49:12,208 --> 01:49:14,624
They'll certainly win 10-12 seats.

1426
01:49:15,250 --> 01:49:17,665
Put up tents all around this place.

1427
01:49:17,791 --> 01:49:19,082
And, all the tents..

1428
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,249
You don't need to
put up the tent, pal.

1429
01:49:22,458 --> 01:49:23,832
Work on your speech.

1430
01:49:23,916 --> 01:49:25,582
People only listen to you.

1431
01:49:26,208 --> 01:49:27,165
I will speak.

1432
01:49:33,958 --> 01:49:36,582
What's going on here?

1433
01:49:36,875 --> 01:49:37,582
Get out!

1434
01:49:37,666 --> 01:49:39,290
- Take these out.
- Why?

1435
01:49:39,708 --> 01:49:42,374
- We've official permission.
- What permission?

1436
01:49:43,041 --> 01:49:44,249
We're the official.

1437
01:49:44,833 --> 01:49:46,415
You don't have our permission.

1438
01:49:46,791 --> 01:49:48,290
- They can't just take it off?
- Take these out!

1439
01:49:48,375 --> 01:49:50,915
- Look, sir, we..
- Has the government stooped so low?

1440
01:49:51,583 --> 01:49:53,540
Don't touch me,
or I'll have to take action.

1441
01:49:53,708 --> 01:49:55,290
- Go ahead. Take action!
- Zoya.

1442
01:49:55,375 --> 01:49:56,957
- Beat us!
- Zoya.

1443
01:49:57,041 --> 01:49:59,040
- Stop, Zoya.
- Move back.

1444
01:49:59,125 --> 01:50:00,707
Sir, please try to understand.

1445
01:50:00,791 --> 01:50:03,082
Sir! Sir! Sir!

1446
01:50:03,416 --> 01:50:05,249
You shouldn't raise
your hand on women!

1447
01:50:07,041 --> 01:50:09,207
- Did you record that?
- Yes.

1448
01:50:09,791 --> 01:50:10,999
Do you want me to upload it?

1449
01:50:14,125 --> 01:50:16,082
That's okay. I'll handle it.

1450
01:50:16,791 --> 01:50:18,040
And, sir.

1451
01:50:18,416 --> 01:50:21,040
Even if we win 2
seats in the elections..

1452
01:50:21,125 --> 01:50:24,665
You'll definitely get transferred.

1453
01:50:25,125 --> 01:50:27,999
Sir. We get orders too.

1454
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:31,207
We've no personal enmity with you.

1455
01:50:32,250 --> 01:50:33,082
Sorry.

1456
01:50:36,208 --> 01:50:37,540
Whose orders?

1457
01:50:38,958 --> 01:50:40,832
Vinod Gupta.

1458
01:50:42,041 --> 01:50:44,374
We could've talked
to the inspector calmly.

1459
01:50:44,625 --> 01:50:46,415
Only 10 more days of campaigning.

1460
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:49,582
It's not a good idea to
get in a tiff with the police.

1461
01:50:50,416 --> 01:50:51,874
Come on, dear. Go home.

1462
01:50:51,958 --> 01:50:54,415
Study. Exams are close.

1463
01:50:55,791 --> 01:50:58,999
Him. He'll be the
leader of the masses!

1464
01:51:05,041 --> 01:51:07,707
Don't try to catch the
snake by the hood, Gupta..

1465
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,582
If it stings,
you'll be in deep trouble.

1466
01:51:13,083 --> 01:51:13,957
Let's go.

1467
01:51:14,958 --> 01:51:16,624
Where are you going, Mr. Gupta?

1468
01:51:16,708 --> 01:51:18,415
Let me tell you a joke.

1469
01:51:19,208 --> 01:51:22,040
Everything he does is right,
and what I do is wrong.

1470
01:51:22,541 --> 01:51:24,332
He's the undisputed
leader of the party.

1471
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:26,082
We'll need his permission
for everything, right?

1472
01:51:26,250 --> 01:51:28,874
He'll give the speech.
Help us win the elections!

1473
01:51:30,541 --> 01:51:32,624
Let me congratulate you Kundan!

1474
01:51:33,333 --> 01:51:35,374
You must be really happy, you dog!

1475
01:51:35,625 --> 01:51:37,040
What else do you need?

1476
01:51:37,375 --> 01:51:39,957
Now, you've the position
of the man you killed.

1477
01:51:40,083 --> 01:51:42,457
And, now you want his
girlfriend to sleep with, right?

1478
01:51:42,791 --> 01:51:43,999
What else do you want?

1479
01:51:44,708 --> 01:51:47,165
I never cried over Jasjeet's death.

1480
01:51:47,416 --> 01:51:51,207
I wanted to dedicate my
life to fulfil his last dream.

1481
01:51:51,666 --> 01:51:53,165
That's all.

1482
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,290
But, you can snatch that too.

1483
01:51:56,500 --> 01:52:01,874
Yes! He killed Jasjeet.
And you're cheering him!

1484
01:52:02,208 --> 01:52:04,582
Anand Srivastav!
This man killed him!

1485
01:52:04,666 --> 01:52:06,124
Go ahead, lick him!

1486
01:52:09,333 --> 01:52:11,207
You didn't just lose Jasjeet..

1487
01:52:11,291 --> 01:52:13,915
Or, you didn't lose just a friend.

1488
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,332
I lost my brother.

1489
01:52:15,416 --> 01:52:18,040
That means I get to kill him first.

1490
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:20,499
This man is our last hope.

1491
01:52:20,875 --> 01:52:22,332
You can choose power,
politics, position..

1492
01:52:22,416 --> 01:52:23,832
Over your brother's death.

1493
01:52:24,416 --> 01:52:27,540
Can you all forget the
man that formed this party?

1494
01:52:27,916 --> 01:52:30,040
His agenda wasn't just
winning the elections.

1495
01:52:30,708 --> 01:52:33,082
He had principles, he believed him.

1496
01:52:33,666 --> 01:52:36,249
And he died because of this man.

1497
01:52:39,708 --> 01:52:42,790
Honestly son,
my son passed because of you.

1498
01:52:42,875 --> 01:52:44,457
You made it possible.

1499
01:52:44,541 --> 01:52:46,624
- Police?
- Why are they here?

1500
01:52:52,041 --> 01:52:53,582
Come on, son. Apologise.

1501
01:52:55,666 --> 01:52:57,957
Apologise,
or we'll break your bones.

1502
01:52:59,041 --> 01:53:02,249
Mr. Gupta. I never even
apologised to my father..

1503
01:53:02,333 --> 01:53:03,582
When I made a mistake.

1504
01:53:04,625 --> 01:53:08,207
And now, it's not my mistake,
neither are you my father.

1505
01:53:10,333 --> 01:53:11,290
Beat him!

1506
01:53:13,291 --> 01:53:15,665
- Stop.
- Don't beat him.

1507
01:53:15,958 --> 01:53:18,290
Kundan, let him go.

1508
01:53:18,708 --> 01:53:20,082
Let Kundan go.

1509
01:53:24,208 --> 01:53:25,415
What are you thinking?

1510
01:53:26,833 --> 01:53:28,040
Say it.

1511
01:53:29,291 --> 01:53:31,332
Thankfully Zoya said everything.

1512
01:53:34,791 --> 01:53:36,332
I couldn't have.

1513
01:53:39,375 --> 01:53:40,999
I should leave.

1514
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:46,415
Look.

1515
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,457
There are two types of leaders.

1516
01:53:51,166 --> 01:53:54,374
One, that likes to
dissolve the government.

1517
01:53:55,708 --> 01:53:58,999
And the other,
who like to make a government.

1518
01:54:00,625 --> 01:54:04,165
I knew Jasjeet better
than these two women!

1519
01:54:05,083 --> 01:54:07,040
He was the second type.

1520
01:54:08,833 --> 01:54:09,915
Stay.

1521
01:54:10,708 --> 01:54:14,124
But, this time you've
got to do something.

1522
01:54:20,458 --> 01:54:23,499
Madam. That's a really
nice gift for Kapil.

1523
01:54:23,833 --> 01:54:25,040
But, think Gupta.

1524
01:54:26,041 --> 01:54:29,040
If he bites us only for his ego.

1525
01:54:29,250 --> 01:54:31,665
Pees over the 2015 budget.

1526
01:54:31,916 --> 01:54:34,874
And bites every
minister and official?

1527
01:54:38,250 --> 01:54:40,207
Sorry, madam. It was a mistake.

1528
01:54:40,291 --> 01:54:43,124
You've turned this into a chaos..

1529
01:54:43,208 --> 01:54:45,040
And say it's a mistake.

1530
01:54:45,291 --> 01:54:47,082
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

1531
01:54:47,166 --> 01:54:48,624
The next five years..

1532
01:54:48,791 --> 01:54:50,790
You will be handling
that dog, Gupta.

1533
01:54:51,041 --> 01:54:52,957
You've enjoyed too many
privileges for too long.

1534
01:54:53,291 --> 01:54:56,165
Santram, take me to St.
George's Hospital.

1535
01:54:56,250 --> 01:54:59,040
Will you tell me
what this is all about?

1536
01:55:00,333 --> 01:55:01,665
Start from the very beginning.

1537
01:55:02,208 --> 01:55:04,499
It's the first time police
has entered JNU Campus.

1538
01:55:04,583 --> 01:55:05,374
And, your reaction?

1539
01:55:05,458 --> 01:55:07,124
Who said it's the first time?
It's happened before.

1540
01:55:07,208 --> 01:55:08,665
Madam, yours is a political party.

1541
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:10,207
So, how can you operate
from a government institute.

1542
01:55:10,291 --> 01:55:11,665
The administration
doesn't have a problem..

1543
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:12,499
So, why do you?

1544
01:55:12,583 --> 01:55:14,832
Ms. Zoya, what was the
reason behind the scuffle.

1545
01:55:14,916 --> 01:55:16,624
Look. We are the victims here.

1546
01:55:17,875 --> 01:55:19,249
My friends are hurt.

1547
01:55:19,541 --> 01:55:21,082
Many have suffered broken bones!

1548
01:55:22,708 --> 01:55:24,874
Why don't you go to Mr.
Gupta's office?

1549
01:55:25,333 --> 01:55:27,665
Why not raise this question
outside the Parliament?

1550
01:55:27,875 --> 01:55:30,457
We'll give a reply.
But, not like this.

1551
01:55:31,291 --> 01:55:32,332
Not when we're beaten.

1552
01:55:32,791 --> 01:55:34,165
We'll do it on a stage.

1553
01:55:34,791 --> 01:55:36,124
And, on the top of our voice.

1554
01:55:38,291 --> 01:55:41,540
We're organizing a rally.
You're all invited.

1555
01:55:41,708 --> 01:55:43,207
- Thank you.
- Ma'am, please..

1556
01:55:56,125 --> 01:55:57,915
May I have a word with you, Zoya?

1557
01:56:00,541 --> 01:56:01,374
Alone?

1558
01:56:05,791 --> 01:56:07,499
Sad about Jasjeet.

1559
01:56:09,041 --> 01:56:10,624
I often heard about him.

1560
01:56:11,041 --> 01:56:13,957
I met him once.
At the IsC Conference.

1561
01:56:14,958 --> 01:56:17,790
- He was an intelligent boy.
- He did tell me.

1562
01:56:18,666 --> 01:56:20,267
He said you're quite
intelligent as well.

1563
01:56:23,333 --> 01:56:25,290
So, how can you be so stupid?

1564
01:56:26,958 --> 01:56:27,999
Miss Zoya is here.

1565
01:56:28,041 --> 01:56:29,957
Excuse me!

1566
01:56:32,708 --> 01:56:35,207
C.M came.

1567
01:56:40,875 --> 01:56:42,582
Name your price
for giving us Kundan.

1568
01:56:42,875 --> 01:56:45,165
Ask him to join our party.

1569
01:56:46,333 --> 01:56:49,124
I'm telling you because
you're close to him.

1570
01:56:50,833 --> 01:56:52,040
The party is Jasjeet's.

1571
01:56:53,416 --> 01:56:54,415
Kundan's the leader.

1572
01:56:54,625 --> 01:56:57,249
And, what about you? Nothing.

1573
01:56:58,500 --> 01:57:00,499
The reason your party
made it this far..

1574
01:57:00,583 --> 01:57:02,624
Was only because of Kundan.

1575
01:57:03,708 --> 01:57:04,915
Are you done?

1576
01:57:08,083 --> 01:57:09,249
Thank you.

1577
01:57:13,083 --> 01:57:14,207
Why did you feel hurt?

1578
01:57:16,291 --> 01:57:17,499
Did I say something wrong?

1579
01:57:19,583 --> 01:57:23,207
Zoya, Jasjeet would've
been really sad..

1580
01:57:24,333 --> 01:57:25,957
To see you in this condition.

1581
01:57:27,708 --> 01:57:28,665
Come on in.

1582
01:57:30,041 --> 01:57:30,832
Let's talk.

1583
01:57:39,333 --> 01:57:40,707
Just think about it, Zoya.

1584
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,999
Think. No pressure.

1585
01:57:43,208 --> 01:57:45,707
You know my house. Office too.

1586
01:57:46,083 --> 01:57:47,957
My secretary will
be in touch with you.

1587
01:57:48,500 --> 01:57:51,040
Let me know if you change your mood.

1588
01:58:13,375 --> 01:58:15,165
Everyone likes you, Kundan.

1589
01:58:16,958 --> 01:58:17,999
You're their hero.

1590
01:58:19,583 --> 01:58:20,540
Stay back.

1591
01:58:23,083 --> 01:58:24,415
They all need you.

1592
01:58:37,708 --> 01:58:44,540
âI don't want anything from you.""

1593
01:58:45,125 --> 01:58:51,874
""No consolation, or faith.""

1594
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:59,290
""No applauds, or sympathy.""

1595
01:58:59,791 --> 01:59:06,249
""No dreams, no comfort.""

1596
01:59:06,916 --> 01:59:07,790
Sorry!

1597
01:59:07,875 --> 01:59:15,875
""Don't look at me like this.""

1598
01:59:21,500 --> 01:59:26,707
- Where's your husband?
- He's dead.

1599
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:31,457
Dead? There he is.

1600
01:59:38,583 --> 01:59:46,583
âI am the song... you
don't want to listen.""

1601
01:59:51,666 --> 01:59:57,290
""The first leaf... fallen in Autumn.""

1602
01:59:59,083 --> 02:00:06,165
""A drop of tear... in the desert.""

1603
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:13,499
âI'm the moment that's passed.""

1604
02:00:14,041 --> 02:00:17,082
""No way I can come back.""

1605
02:00:17,166 --> 02:00:21,457
""That's true.""

1606
02:00:22,208 --> 02:00:30,208
""Don't look at me... like
you never saw me before.""

1607
02:00:36,541 --> 02:00:41,874
""Like you never saw me before.""

1608
02:00:44,375 --> 02:00:49,040
""Don't look at me..""

1609
02:00:49,083 --> 02:00:51,374
Load these as well.

1610
02:00:51,458 --> 02:00:53,040
Who is calling now?

1611
02:00:53,125 --> 02:00:56,207
Kundan, answer the phone.

1612
02:00:57,333 --> 02:00:58,249
Anant.

1613
02:00:58,958 --> 02:01:00,582
Kundan and I are taking a rickshaw.

1614
02:01:01,083 --> 02:01:04,040
- You guys take the bus.
- Okay.

1615
02:02:14,958 --> 02:02:16,290
These are Jasjeet's clothes.

1616
02:02:20,041 --> 02:02:22,832
This Nehru jacket looked
really nice on him.

1617
02:02:24,375 --> 02:02:26,249
I couldn't see him make it this far.

1618
02:02:29,041 --> 02:02:30,499
So, why not you.

1619
02:02:32,333 --> 02:02:34,707
I couldn't help him prepare
for the battle.

1620
02:02:35,458 --> 02:02:36,874
So, why not you.

1621
02:02:41,333 --> 02:02:43,790
The first day I saw you in Delhi..

1622
02:02:44,666 --> 02:02:46,957
I wanted to hug you.

1623
02:02:48,875 --> 02:02:53,790
And ask... won't you do anything..

1624
02:02:55,333 --> 02:02:57,124
For the same Zoya
you slit your wrist.

1625
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:03,582
The world will spit on me
if I love you.

1626
02:03:06,875 --> 02:03:11,040
But look, I'm in love now.

1627
02:03:18,166 --> 02:03:19,290
You're looking nice.

1628
02:03:26,666 --> 02:03:27,665
Go on, Kundan.

1629
02:03:29,458 --> 02:03:30,957
Everyone's waiting for you.

1630
02:03:33,375 --> 02:03:36,332
Kundan, go!

1631
02:03:44,541 --> 02:03:46,499
You're doing everything so well..

1632
02:03:47,500 --> 02:03:50,040
Why did falter here now?

1633
02:03:51,125 --> 02:03:54,415
Zoya, you're trying to prove
a Muslim, Hindu again.

1634
02:03:56,458 --> 02:03:57,582
Control yourself.

1635
02:03:58,875 --> 02:04:00,207
No need to love me.

1636
02:04:03,625 --> 02:04:07,124
They're crazy, but you're smart.

1637
02:04:08,333 --> 02:04:13,124
I don't know what
you're trying to do..

1638
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,915
Or, where you're asking me to go.

1639
02:04:16,458 --> 02:04:18,915
But, I'll go anywhere you ask me to.

1640
02:04:21,583 --> 02:04:27,290
And I swear, I will win.

1641
02:04:28,625 --> 02:04:35,957
And, if you still
say you don't love me..

1642
02:04:43,583 --> 02:04:46,165
Then you can slap me 17 times.

1643
02:04:47,875 --> 02:04:55,875
Otherwise, I will take my 17 kisses.

1644
02:05:24,791 --> 02:05:26,374
'Everything can still be fixed.'

1645
02:05:26,708 --> 02:05:30,582
'You've to keep Kundan until
the last day of the campaign.'

1646
02:05:31,083 --> 02:05:33,624
'You just announced a big rally.'

1647
02:05:33,958 --> 02:05:37,207
'Yourjob is to bring Kundan
to that rally.'

1648
02:05:42,458 --> 02:05:43,957
'And according to the situation..'

1649
02:05:44,041 --> 02:05:45,999
'..you might win a few seats.'

1650
02:05:47,333 --> 02:05:50,207
'But, that's possible only
when Kundan's with you.'

1651
02:05:50,958 --> 02:05:53,790
'So, that face will help you win.'

1652
02:05:54,333 --> 02:05:57,874
'On the last day of
the campaign, finish him.'

1653
02:05:58,250 --> 02:05:59,790
'The police will pose no threat.'

1654
02:06:00,458 --> 02:06:05,165
'An small explosion can scatter
such gatherings.'

1655
02:06:11,458 --> 02:06:15,415
'Doesn't take long to start
a pandemonium.'

1656
02:06:44,791 --> 02:06:46,957
Hello madam, look.

1657
02:07:03,625 --> 02:07:08,249
'Doesn't take long to shoot
a bullet in such places.'

1658
02:07:18,833 --> 02:07:21,124
'And what's left behind? Seats.'

1659
02:07:21,583 --> 02:07:23,790
'You just need to
extend your support..'

1660
02:07:23,875 --> 02:07:25,624
'..to our party,
after Kundan's dead.'

1661
02:07:25,708 --> 02:07:27,624
'Who'll be the leader
of your party..'

1662
02:07:27,708 --> 02:07:29,624
'..of course, only you will decide.'

1663
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:35,415
'That will take care of your job,
and ours too.'

1664
02:07:36,375 --> 02:07:37,415
'Scores settled.'

1665
02:07:51,916 --> 02:07:54,415
How can they stoop that low?

1666
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:57,207
Some people believe
that Kundan's been shot..

1667
02:07:57,291 --> 02:08:01,374
While others believe
he's been badly beaten up.

1668
02:08:01,791 --> 02:08:03,874
Only time will tell us the truth.

1669
02:08:31,791 --> 02:08:34,249
Calm down! Please calm down!

1670
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:38,582
You all want to know..

1671
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:44,540
Whether we're involved
in the India Gate incident?

1672
02:08:46,250 --> 02:08:49,707
Well, the answer's right before you.

1673
02:08:50,333 --> 02:08:56,499
Can we hurt those we want
to make an alliance with?

1674
02:08:56,583 --> 02:09:01,040
Well, no leader can be that stupid.

1675
02:09:01,375 --> 02:09:02,374
Come, Zoya.

1676
02:09:02,833 --> 02:09:04,540
Come, share the big news.

1677
02:09:22,250 --> 02:09:26,290
The big news isn't
what the CM just announced.

1678
02:09:28,166 --> 02:09:29,540
The big news is that..

1679
02:09:30,375 --> 02:09:34,165
She's involved in the India Gate
incident that occurred today.

1680
02:09:39,416 --> 02:09:40,874
And, me too.

1681
02:10:09,208 --> 02:10:10,874
Her reasons obvious.

1682
02:10:12,291 --> 02:10:16,040
And, it'll take all
night to know mine.

1683
02:10:18,333 --> 02:10:20,832
By the way, I'm ready to go myself.

1684
02:10:22,625 --> 02:10:24,957
You can levy an inquiry on her.

1685
02:10:25,500 --> 02:10:27,832
And in 10-15 years,
when it's proven..

1686
02:10:29,125 --> 02:10:30,665
You can send her to me.

1687
02:10:33,666 --> 02:10:36,790
Now the scores are settled.

1688
02:10:46,666 --> 02:10:49,165
Ms. Zoya, is this some kind of
a conspiracy?

1689
02:10:49,250 --> 02:10:51,165
Is the government pressurizing you?

1690
02:10:51,250 --> 02:10:52,457
Tell us, madam..

1691
02:10:52,541 --> 02:10:55,707
You're lying, right?

1692
02:10:56,666 --> 02:10:58,290
How could Kundan go to that rally?

1693
02:10:58,375 --> 02:11:00,249
Because, I had informed him
in the morning..

1694
02:11:00,333 --> 02:11:01,874
That, there's
going to be an uproar.

1695
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,540
Can you take me there?

1696
02:11:29,416 --> 02:11:30,457
Move back!

1697
02:11:31,041 --> 02:11:33,040
You'll die, pal.

1698
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,082
Why endure all that..

1699
02:11:41,833 --> 02:11:42,790
Die.

1700
02:11:43,083 --> 02:11:50,499
Is the government pressurizing you?

1701
02:11:50,750 --> 02:11:52,207
Tell us, madam..

1702
02:12:00,583 --> 02:12:01,582
He's yours.

1703
02:12:03,291 --> 02:12:05,415
My Kundan never spat blood.

1704
02:12:06,416 --> 02:12:07,415
He's yours.

1705
02:12:33,541 --> 02:12:34,624
'That's it.'

1706
02:12:35,541 --> 02:12:37,415
'That was my story.'

1707
02:12:38,375 --> 02:12:40,332
'A girl sitting besides me.'

1708
02:12:40,583 --> 02:12:44,540
'Few doctors,
who were hoping to save me.'

1709
02:12:45,208 --> 02:12:47,082
'A friend, who was insane.'

1710
02:12:55,458 --> 02:12:59,124
'Another girl,
who dedicated her life to me.'

1711
02:13:01,416 --> 02:13:05,540
'My mom,
dad, and the lanes of Beneras.'

1712
02:13:06,500 --> 02:13:09,624
'And my body, that had left me.'

1713
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:13,040
'And my chest,
where the fire was still raging.'

1714
02:13:13,791 --> 02:13:15,999
'l could've got up, but for whom?'

1715
02:13:16,291 --> 02:13:18,124
'l could've screamed, but for whom?'

1716
02:13:18,791 --> 02:13:22,040
'My love, Zoya, Beneras,
Bindiya, Murari..'

1717
02:13:22,083 --> 02:13:23,707
'..they were all slipping away.'

1718
02:13:24,583 --> 02:13:26,332
'But, why would I
have stayed back for?'

1719
02:13:27,458 --> 02:13:32,040
'The fire inside me could've
kept me alive, or kill me.'

1720
02:13:32,583 --> 02:13:33,957
'But, why get up now.'

1721
02:13:34,166 --> 02:13:36,415
'Who's got the courage
to fall in love again..'

1722
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:37,707
'..suffer a heart-break.'

1723
02:13:38,541 --> 02:13:40,665
'Somebody stop me.'

1724
02:13:41,875 --> 02:13:44,832
'This girl besides me
with the blank stare..'

1725
02:13:45,083 --> 02:13:47,915
'..l can still get up for her.'

1726
02:13:49,041 --> 02:13:52,124
'But no.
I'm not in the mood anymore.'

1727
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:56,707
'It's better to close my eyes.
To get into deep slumber.'

1728
02:13:57,125 --> 02:13:58,624
'But, I will get up again some day.'

1729
02:13:59,166 --> 02:14:01,374
'To ring the tabor on
the banks of Ganges.'

1730
02:14:01,791 --> 02:14:03,540
'To run in those lanes.'

1731
02:14:05,083 --> 02:14:07,915
'To fall for some Zoya again.'

1732
02:14:35,291 --> 02:14:39,499
""To you. All the roads lead to you.""

1733
02:14:39,583 --> 02:14:43,665

""Fiery face. And the dark eyes.""

1738
02:15:11,291 --> 02:15:13,707
""We fight and squabble.""

1739
02:15:15,166 --> 02:15:17,707
""You seem to be mine. And
sometimes you seem like a dream.""

1740
02:15:19,333 --> 02:15:23,665
""When you look at me.""

1741

Only you.""

""Only you.""

""My body is grooving.
My heart's thumping.""

""The entire world knows
what's in my heart.""

02:18:54,125 --> 02:18:56,415
""Only I know what's in your heart.""

1776

âI'm so proud of myself.
I have lost control.""

tt4354740,Dharam Sankat Mein,"1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,277
What is happen to this city?

2
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:09,375
Ashes here, smoke there.

3
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:11,908
Why are you so silent?

4
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:14,813
Why have smoke forced
down your throat?

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,476
Now it's the limit of endurance.

6
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:20,839
Let's bring this
reckless act to an end.

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,107
Smoking is banned
in all public places.

8
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:25,643
Violation will lead to penalty.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,611
Don't smoke.

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,179
No let anyone do.

11
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:31,747
Smoking will cost you.

12
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:37,771
Who doesn't want to be happy?

13
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:42,543
But at what price?

14
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:46,205
Smoking will cost you.

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,774
Smoking can cost you your health.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,339
And for your dear ones.

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,202
Smoking will cost you.

18
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,444
Oh, God! You are omniscient.

19
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:29,638
You know what everyone desires.

20
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:33,271
Then, why must the people
you created shout out to You?

21
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,836
To remind people like you who've
strayed to return to the path.

22
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:37,606
Here, get sober now.

23
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,771
What's this? Unsweetened
lime juice early in the morning?

24
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,336
Why don't you get me something
sweet, sugar?

25
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,175
Just forget about it
and take this.

26
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:47,043
You have to go to the
Ashram with Amit. Hurry!

27
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:48,612
This is such a pain!

28
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:51,509
Why should I hover around
the ashram since he is devoted?

29
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:55,805
I asked the maid to come early
today, but she's not here either!

30
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,436
Antara is still out jogging.

31
00:03:57,533 --> 00:04:00,173
If I have to get all of you
to the same place on time...

32
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:01,541
...it is mission impossible!

33
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:04,307
You're supposed to be a Jain caterer,
but all your behaviour is Non veg.

34
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,511
It makes me so crazy!

35
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:10,148
Please don't put on that song
again!

36
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:12,670
We must go to the Ashram with Amit.

37
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:16,573
Let's kick start the
day on a good note.

38
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,643
This is just what I need.

39
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,941
Please hurry up! Come on.

40
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:22,644

77
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:55,074
I need chutney with the dhoklas.
Get some, please?

78
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:56,578
Forget about the chutney.

79
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:57,805
Drink this juice.

80
00:06:57,867 --> 00:07:00,040
You'll get acidity.
- Acidity, it seems.

81
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,971
Dad, don't change the topic!

82
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:04,341
Shraddha is a sweet girl.

83
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,902
She may be, I don't deny that.

84
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,377
Listen, I'm willing to accept her
as my daughter-in-law.

85
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,912
But, she has to accept me
the way I am. That's it.

86
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,009
It's not Shraddha,
her dad is the problem here.

87
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,205
Are you going to marry her dad?

88
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:21,343
His dad-in-law is in the temple
all day long, tolling the bell.

89
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,909
I didn't ask you to stay
in the temple all day long.

90
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:27,004
He should just get the feeling
we are somewhat religious.

91
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,340
Somewhat religious?

92
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:31,480
Your dad-in-law is eternally
the feet of that holy man.

93
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:33,337
I can't do that, okay?

94
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,970
Why don't you pick another girl?

95
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:36,774
Some friend of hers, maybe?
Set him up!

96
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,570
<i>Come on, dad'.
- Amâ.</i>

97
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:43,745
Come fast. Bus has arrived.

98
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,876
These people should not be
allowed to stay in one's society.

99
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,177
He's rented the house and
staked claim on the entire street.

100
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,338
Hey!
- Dad I'll go and see.

101
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,073
Kick his darn car!

102
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:02,675
Ever since he's moved in
he's given all kinds of trouble.

103
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:11,446
Forget it. I bet the aristocrat is
still asleep. Get back here.

104
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,606
What the...

105
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,037
Oh, no! What did you do?

106
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,547
Another notice.

107
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,402
Amit! Come on!

108
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:25,743
If he sees, he's create a huge scene!
Come back!

109
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,543
You are pests!

110
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,879
All the devotees are kindly
requested...

111
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:03,813
...that the counters
which are set up...

112
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,609
...are providing blue water,
blue veneration materials.

113
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,807
Hail.

114
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:13,139
- I hope he doesn't renounce the world.
- I'd love that.

115
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:18,135
Look at the map.
It has all the details.

116
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,341
The Neelashram is
spread over 30 acres.

117
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,040
Dad! Dad, where are you lost?

118
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,878
The same place where you
lost yourself, son.

119
00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:40,912
Let's go.

120
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,904
Neel (Blue) water, blue...

121
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:48,879
Massage oil and Neel Ayurved?

122
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,136
Neel real estate!

123
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,738
This is 400 sqft
and that is 600 sqft.

124
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,779
Listen, why don't they come out
with a public issue?

125
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,369
Dad, please don't joke.

126
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,876
Sir, this isn't a joke.
They are thinking about it.

127
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:06,237
See?

128
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:07,839
Get out of the way!

129
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,542
Watch it.
Take care.

130
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,436
Hail Neel Baba.

131
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,111
Praised be Neel Baba.

132
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,077
Hail Neel Baba.

133
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,902
Hail Neel Baba!

134
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,107
Is it going to rain?

135
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:37,140
Rain?
No.

136
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:39,913
Why are they wearing raincoat
caps?

137
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:41,742
Dad, that's the Neel headgear.

138
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,711
These are staunch devotees
of Swamiji.

139
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,878
So staunch devotees wear a uniform.
- Yes.

140
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:50,944
Yes, tell me Hasmukh.
- Shraddha.

141
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:53,977
What? The Kachori maker?

142
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:55,375
Speak softly!

143
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:57,504
One moment, I'll call you later.

144
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,376
Dad! It's Shraddha.

145
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:03,710
Doesn't she look a bit
too old for you?

146
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:06,344
She's a better fit for me.

147
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,470
The one you're looking
at is her mom.

148
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:10,137
Shradha is behind her.
- Oh, her mom?

149
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,308
Well, the mom is pretty awesome, too.
- Hey!

150
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:15,412
She's the mom.

151
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,074
She's nice.

152
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:25,013
Swami Neelanand's grace...

153
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:27,238
...is going to spread
all over the world.

154
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:31,046
After setting up ashrams
on American land...

155
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:35,843
...Swamiji has established the Neel
family on an international level.

156
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:41,307
And he inaugurated the Neel Ayurved
center at the ashram in Bhopal.

157
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,409
The sky is...
- Blue!

158
00:11:44,467 --> 00:11:46,947
The ocean is...
- Blue!

159
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:49,843
The eyes are...
- Blue!

160
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:55,711
""Neelanand Baba.""

161
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,807
""Neelanand Baba.""

162
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:08,009
""Neelanand Baba.""

163
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:11,947
""Neelanand Baba.""

164
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,245
""The one who comes
to you, Baba...""

165
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:24,543
""The one who comes
to you, Baba...""

166
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,571
""You shower him with happiness.""

167
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:32,843
""The one who comes
to you, Baba...""

168
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:37,279
""You shower him with happiness.""

169
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:41,543
""Neelanand Baba.""

170
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,776
""Neelanand Baba.""

171
00:12:57,433 --> 00:12:59,174
Hail Neelanand Maharaj!

172
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:00,576
Hail Neelanand Swami!

173
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:02,544
Hail Lord Neelanand!

174
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:11,546
After consuming
the poison in the world

175
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,281
Lord Shiv was called Neelkanth.

176
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:22,813
I am entered this world to consume
the poison in your lives.

177
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,304
Hail Baba!
- He's a great man.

178
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:30,339
Give me poison,
I will give you joy.

179
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:35,007
Give me your poison!

180
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:37,874
Give me your poison!

181
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:40,880
Hail the Lord of Joy!
- Hail!

182
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:43,209
Hail Neelanand Maharaj!
- Hail!

183
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,338
Hail Neelanand Maharaj!
- Hail!

184
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,175
Hail Neelanand Maharaj!
- Swamiji! - Baba!

185
00:13:48,267 --> 00:13:50,144
Swamiji!
- Babaji, here! Swamiji!

186
00:13:58,367 --> 00:14:02,042
Hello, Swamiji.
- Basically, I know it all.

187
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,081
But, I'd rather hear it from you.

188
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:08,079
What is bothering you?

189
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:10,513
Swamiji, I have an MBA degree.

190
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,604
I can't really hear well.
Come closer, please.

191
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:17,277
Swamiji, I have an MBA degree.

192
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,179
I've been trying for a really
long time.

193
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:21,269
But, I can't find a job.
- Hmm.

194
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:24,470
From today, you...

195
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,873
...you will manage the operation
of my ashram.

196
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,649
The ashram needs your service.

197
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,613
What kind of service will he
get her to do? - Dad!

198
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:40,045
Thank you.
- Hail Neelanand Maharaj! - Hail!

199
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,410
Hail Neelanand Swami!
- Hail!

200
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:44,845
Hail Lord Neelanand!
- Hail!

201
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,403
Swamiji, I...
- Hey, stop!

202
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:49,708
Swamiji! Me, me, me!
- Yes, tell me.

203
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,040
Talk to me, son.
- Swamiji!

204
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,046
Swamiji, I am in big, big trouble!

205
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,876
I have been married
for eight years!

206
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,081
But I still don't have anyone
to call me dad.

207
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:02,046
Please, son out my problem.

208
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,149
From today, your worries
are my worries.

209
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:11,339
You can stop worrying.

210
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,936
Yes, Swamiji!

211
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:19,747
Hello?
What?

212
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,176
Really?

213
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,640
Really!

214
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,580
My wife is expecting!

215
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:30,738
My wife is expecting a baby!

216
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:32,976
My wife is pregnant!

217
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,603
I am going to have a baby!

218
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,374
Hail Swamiji!
- Hail!

219
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:37,571
Hail Swamiji!
- Hail!

220
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:39,374
Say it!
- Hail Swamiji! - Hail!

221
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:41,879
Well dad via satellite.

222
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,104
When you are thinking
of my image...

223
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:50,812
...when you are devoted to me...

224
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,813
...without any doubt...

225
00:15:54,867 --> 00:15:56,744
...he is my best devotee!

226
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,872
And I will certainly grace
him with the best!

227
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:02,377
Hail Swamiji!
- Hail!

228
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:04,140
""Neelanand Baba.""

229
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,875
""Neelanand Baba.""

230
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:12,075
""The one who truly loves you...

231
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:17,014
...and you help him in every way.""

232
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:24,574
""The one who truly loves you...

233
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:29,013
...and you help him in every way.""

234
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,411
""You destroy the sorrow...

235
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,606
""You destroy the sorrow...

236
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,407
""You destroy the sorrow...

237
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,573
""When someone comes
over to you, Baba...

238
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:46,082
...you shower happiness on him.""

239
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:50,206
""Neelanand Baba.""

240
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,407
""Neelanand Baba.""

241
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,607
""Neelanand Baba.""

242
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,614
""Neelanand Baba.""

243
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,112
It's no big deal, dad.

244
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,510
You just have to attend prayer
meetings and perform venerations.

245
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,840
And what about some dancing?

246
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,141
That fat lady looked so funny!

247
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:23,337
Of course.

248
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:24,810
And it will be good.

249
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:27,541
At least you'll chant
the name of the Lord.

250
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,707
If I chant the name of the Lord
in the Ashram...

251
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,144
...is Neelanand going to run
my business?

252
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:34,269
Talk to the girl at least!

253
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:37,275
If her parents have any issues,
don't be scared.

254
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,943
I will get you married, okay?
- What?

255
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,543
What is he going to do? Shed
crocodile tears for a few days.

256
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:44,670
Then, they'll get back on track.
Go ahead, talk to her.

257
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,677
Shraddha won't do that.

258
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,303
Her dad is a heart patient.

259
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,902
He's a mental patient.

260
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,641
The entire community is insane.

261
00:17:52,867 --> 00:17:54,210
""Heart patient!""

262
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,442
These old folks blackmail one
for the smallest things.

263
00:17:57,633 --> 00:17:59,374
I'm a heart patient!

264
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,438
You're bound to die some day!

265
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,801
Elope with her.

266
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:05,143
Pack your bags and elope.
I will deal with the rest.

267
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,237
You don't have to create
that kind of scene.

268
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,609
The marriage will take place
with everyone's consent.

269
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:11,044
And it will be a great wedding!

270
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,043
A great wedding.

271
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,807
Anyway, your sugar levels are too high.
- What?

272
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:18,878
How is Amit's wedding connected
to my sugar levels? Tell me!

273
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:23,677
Why not? If you wake up early
and walk to the temple...

274
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:25,974
...it will be nice walk.
Right?

275
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:28,047
The sugar level
will level itself out.

276
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:31,243
Do you know why I am the top most
caterer in Ahmadabad?

277
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:34,671
Because, I taste every single
dish. Get it?

278
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:37,274
I can't do all this.

279
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:39,173
Indu, I'm leaving.

280
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:40,906
Alright, don't forget to
go to the bank today.

281
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:42,207
Why should I go to the bank?

282
00:18:42,267 --> 00:18:45,009
Baa died over two months ago!

283
00:18:45,067 --> 00:18:46,740
You still haven't
opened up her bank locker.

284
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,245
I'm sure it doesn't
contain a treasure.

285
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,370
What do you mean?
- Fine, I'll get it. Come on.

286
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:52,106
Don't forget.
- Alright, I won't.

287
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:07,705
Hey, Mr. Noticewala!

288
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,843
What is this?

289
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,403
My name is not Mr. Noticewala.

290
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:14,140
I have told you so many times!

291
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,149
My name is Nawab Mehmood
Nazeem Ali Shah Khan Bahadur.

292
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,178
Show some respect.

293
00:19:20,267 --> 00:19:22,213
I asked for your name,
not a long winded address.

294
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:23,875
Forget it!
What's going on?

295
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:25,708
Why do you keep handing out
notices for every little thing?

296
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:27,804
Why don't you park that piece of
junk to the side?

297
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,002
Junk?
-Yes!

298
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,102
This is a 1945 car!

299
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:32,202
It's a vintage car!

300
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,280
You scratched it!
Open your eyes wide and look!

301
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,370
That's what you get for parking it
in the middle of the road,

302
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,947
Listen, you could have requested
and I could have shifted it.

303
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,345
Excuse me, my son rang your
doorbell ten times!

304
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:44,406
I guess, you were sleeping.
What else?

305
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:46,346
No, I was in the washroom.

306
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:48,773
In the washroom?

307
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,147
What kind of food do
you guys eat?

308
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,508
Washroom?

309
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,541
Uncultured man!

310
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:58,838
I meant, I was in the bathroom.

311
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,607
Uncultured?

312
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,006
Do you know what jhajharu?

313
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:06,207
Jhajharu?

314
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,371
Jhajharu?
Do you know what it means?

315
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,677
Bathroom!
Right?

316
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,970
Yes, right.

317
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:16,741
But, it's not right to keep
handing out these notices.

318
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,371
I sent a bill for the repairs
with the notice.

319
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:20,707
You will have to pay that.

320
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,670
I won't pay this.

321
00:20:24,267 --> 00:20:25,803
I will never pay this!

322
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,106
What proof do you have...

323
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:29,204
...that I scratched that
junked up car of yours?

324
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,145
Want to file a case?
Go ahead!

325
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,372
Go ahead and file a lawsuit!

326
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,808
Why don't you forget it?
Let's go. - Why should I?

327
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,743
He's been issuing notices at
the slightest provocation...

328
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,074
...since 6 months!

329
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:40,204
If it's such trouble
why did you come to live here?

330
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,143
Go and live in a Muslim
locality. Go on!

331
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,146
Listen...
- Communal discrimination!

332
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,879
This is India!

333
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:49,005
Under the Constitutional
Law 295 -A...

334
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,738
...and 298...

335
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,711
...I can put you behind bars!

336
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:55,873
I am not doing to get scared of
these laws and so on!

337
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:57,606
I am not one to get scared either.
- Yes.

338
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,373
I won't get scared, either!

339
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,707
You listen to me.

340
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,905
Don't try to pull rank
since you're in a majority.

341
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,105
This is not going to
work with me.

342
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,009
I don't care what
messes you come up with...

343
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:08,808
...what issues you come up...

344
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,107
...I will get my head cut off,
but I won't bow it!

345
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,670
Now, these people can't think
beyond killing or cutting up stuff.

346
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:16,441
Why are you doing this?
You have to go to the bank.

347
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,343
Let's go!
- Crazy man. - Let's go!

348
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:19,377
Let's go! Come on!

349
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:20,946
What on earth!

350
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,537
Ms. Alka! How are you?

351
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:36,340
Sit, Mr. Dharampal.

352
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:38,135
I'm fine.

353
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:39,906
I heard about your mom.

354
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,040
Yes, well, I guess age will
have its way.

355
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,074
She was such a pleasant woman!

356
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:47,113
I still miss her.

357
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,440
She was a nice person.

358
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,477
And she really loved you, too.

359
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:56,071
No matter what we do, we
can never repay our parents.

360
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,837
Would you like some tea,
coffee, a cold drink?

361
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:00,674
No, nothing, thanks.
Just the locker, please.

362
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:02,041
Okay.
- Let's go. - Let's go.

363
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:16,673
Dad, you look exactly like grandpa.
Right?

364
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:17,939
No.

365
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,012
I think, your dad looks more
like his mom.

366
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:23,810
Don't you think so?

367
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,811
Dad seems disturbed, doesn't he?

368
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,810
Please make it tasty.
We have elite guests.

369
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:39,139
He makes kachoris.
- Hmm.

370
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,611
He's a good chef.
- Mm hmm.

371
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,111
He's been at it since
three years.

372
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:45,104
What's his name?
- Abdul Hameed.

373
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:50,080
I forgot to tell you.
There's a chef from Surat.

374
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:52,135
I have called him in, okay?
- Okay.

375
00:23:52,467 --> 00:23:54,310
Sorry, we'll call
you if we need you.

376
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:55,812
I'll call you.
- Yes, sir.

377
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,343
No use of coming here.

378
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,838
Dharam Bhai.
- Yes?

379
00:24:01,267 --> 00:24:03,247
We have an order for a huge
dinner party.

380
00:24:03,533 --> 00:24:05,843
You have to handle it for
the next few days, please.

381
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,937
Alright, as you wish.

382
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,679
Oh wow!
This is amazing.

383
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:37,645
Sethji, thank you for
the donation to our orphanage.

384
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,472
Alright, Mr. Bhatt.
Tell me. -Yes?

385
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:50,279
Can you say with complete faith
that the kids who come here...

386
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:53,109
...you don't reveal
their parents identity?

387
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,446
I am absolutely sure.

388
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,743
We have to be extremely
careful about that.

389
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:02,748
I can see lots of
old records and files.

390
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,178
It's stacked in here.
We have lots of records.

391
00:25:05,233 --> 00:25:09,375
1965, 1655, 1945, 1960.

392
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:11,674
We even have a few files
which are from pre-lndependence.

393
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:14,406
1960?
- Yes.

394
00:25:15,267 --> 00:25:17,873
1960?
- Yes.

395
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:20,773
No! How can you have 1960?

396
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:22,938
What are you saying?
Yes, we have them. - Really?

397
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,804
Do you see that cupboard
back there? - Yes.

398
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:27,746
It contains files...

399
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,802
...from 1950 to 1960.

400
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:31,812
Really? I don't believe it.

401
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:34,177
If you don't believe it,
I'll fetch them. Wait.

402
00:25:34,434 --> 00:25:36,038
Let me show you this, too.

403
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:38,341
There are loads of papers in here.

404
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,006
What's the big deal?
Look at this, please.

405
00:25:41,533 --> 00:25:45,845
1955, 1956, 1958.

406
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,776
50...where's 60? Where's 1960?

407
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:52,805
Sethji, 1960!

408
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,779
1960.
- Sir, there are men here,

409
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:56,937
not computers.

410
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,002
You press a button and it
says, file not found.

411
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,204
1960...

412
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,312
What immaculate records!

413
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:10,273
What happened?
- It's a secret.

414
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:12,142
It's secret!
- That's nice.

415
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,304
It's secret.

416
00:26:13,367 --> 00:26:15,711
No, but...
- No, but it's secret.

417
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:18,475
I want to see it.
What are you doing?

418
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:20,103
Hey, let go!

419
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,211
Shailesh, Bhupesh, Nimesh, Aakash!

420
00:26:22,534 --> 00:26:24,138
That file is top secret!
Catch him!

421
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,679
Don't let him go!

422
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:30,308
Hey, let go!

423
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:31,869
Oh, God!
- What?

424
00:26:33,267 --> 00:26:36,180
Break the window!
It's top secret! - Get back!

425
00:26:36,267 --> 00:26:37,905
What is this?
Sethji!

426
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:40,345
Sethji! Give me the file!

427
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,346
Give me the file!

428
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,402
Sethji! Please listen to me.

429
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,877
Listen... nab him!

430
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:47,810
Nab him!

431
00:26:48,467 --> 00:26:50,344
Hey! Shut the door!
- Get back!

432
00:26:50,867 --> 00:26:53,814
Praveen! Catch him!
What did he eat for breakfast?

433
00:26:54,534 --> 00:26:56,673
Don't let him get out of here!
Stop him!

434
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,340
Open the door!

435
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,236
Sethji!
<i>'</i> open Up!

436
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,803
Sethji! Get out or
I will drag you out.

437
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,272
Sethji!

438
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,473
Sethji! Open the door.

439
00:27:13,534 --> 00:27:15,070
Sethji, open the door.
- How does it matter?

440
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,705
What are you doing?
- Sethji, please.

441
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,708
Please!

442
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:31,740
Meer Saukhat Ali.

443
00:27:32,534 --> 00:27:34,309
Muslim!

444
00:27:36,233 --> 00:27:37,337
Muslim!

445
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:14,207
Remember!

446
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,871
What is true, is right.

447
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,106
What is this, God?

448
00:29:41,533 --> 00:29:43,376
Why did you create this mess?

449
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,507
This is a major disaster!

450
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,179
You created me a Muslim...

451
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:49,769
...and had me raised as a Hindu?

452
00:29:50,933 --> 00:29:53,379
And You've chosen to reveal
the suspense today! Today?

453
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:55,578
Fifty years after the event!

454
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,577
Did You forget I am a Brahmin?
Here, look at this.

455
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,711
Look at this!
A Brahmin.

456
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:05,969
Yes, I've eaten eggs.

457
00:30:06,267 --> 00:30:07,541
I have eaten chickens
and so on.

458
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,874
I have drunk liquor too.

459
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,773
That... that's a hobby.

460
00:30:10,933 --> 00:30:12,776
I like that.
It's not what I was taught.

461
00:30:12,934 --> 00:30:14,379
My values were that of
a Brahmin.

462
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,575
But, this is a huge punishment!

463
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:20,374
You've just gone ahead and
made me a Muslim!

464
00:30:20,967 --> 00:30:22,105
A Muslim!

465
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:24,937
You could have made me
something else!

466
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:27,871
God, listen to me.

467
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:32,214
You just say that this is
all a dream, okay?

468
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:34,811
But, I will atone for all the sins
I have committed!

469
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,345
Here, take that!
That's for you.

470
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,538
Alright?
Enough?

471
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,381
But, You are going
to say that this is a dream.

472
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,206
A bad dream.

473
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,106
Alright?

474
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:50,577
I know, Yourjustice is delayed,
never denied.

475
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:52,812
I will be waiting outside.

476
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,543
I don't mind waiting.

477
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,173
But, just do all this today
if You don't mind.

478
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,840
Hello.

479
00:31:31,067 --> 00:31:32,341
Remember!

480
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:34,640
That which is right is true!

481
00:31:36,933 --> 00:31:38,708
What happened?
Why are you shouting?

482
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,643
What happened?

483
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:44,239
What?

484
00:31:46,767 --> 00:31:47,905
Punditji.

485
00:31:49,633 --> 00:31:53,513
If I am true, then why am I not
right?

486
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,146
I don't get it.
Just explain it to me.

487
00:31:59,033 --> 00:32:00,740
What can I say to you?

488
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:04,378
I am ruined.

489
00:32:05,233 --> 00:32:07,270
I am doomed.
- What?

490
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:11,407
I am sure, it was a
characterless debauch!

491
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:15,175
He satiated his lust...

492
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,338
...and tossed me at
someone else's door.

493
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,674
Oh, Lord!

494
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:20,872
What kind of sinners
are being born, now?

495
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:23,012
They don't spare young girls.

496
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,736
They hound the old ladies.

497
00:32:24,967 --> 00:32:27,277
And this is the limit!

498
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:30,607
I mean, they didn't even spare
a man of your age! - What?

499
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:34,246
What are you imagining?
- No! You did the right thing.

500
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,602
You have come to Lord Shiva.
Here's what I will do.

501
00:32:36,767 --> 00:32:38,678
I will go inside and
get a Panchmukhi Rudraksha.

502
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:40,337
You have wear it around your neck.

503
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,006
That will heal you and
set you right, too.

504
00:32:43,067 --> 00:32:44,808
I'll be right back.

505
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,577
Where is it?

506
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,541
Indu? What are you looking for?

507
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,443
Allah!
- What?

508
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,174
I'm looking for my key ring.
Why? - The key ring.

509
00:33:00,267 --> 00:33:02,178
Dad!
- Yes.

510
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:05,508
Who gave this?
- Allah sent it.

511
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,680
What?
- Bhalla sent it.

512
00:33:07,733 --> 00:33:09,337
It's Mr. Bhalla's advance.

513
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:11,012
It's a dinner order for
a hundred people.

514
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,410
Why didn't you say it's Bhalla?
Alright.

515
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:55,340
""Who created me?""

516
00:33:57,633 --> 00:34:02,241
""My shadow questions me.""

517
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,043
""I am lost,
whether I exist or not.""

518
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:18,478
""My soul is in agony,
let me see you.""

519
00:34:18,733 --> 00:34:25,673
""Oh, Lord, take away this pain.""

520
00:34:25,767 --> 00:34:27,576
""Oh, Lord.""

521
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:32,074
""Oh, Lord.""

522
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:35,774
""Tell me, who I am.""

523
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:39,440
""You are God and the
Almighty.""

524
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,242
""Oh, Lord.""

525
00:34:47,367 --> 00:34:48,573
lndu.

526
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:52,672
My life is completely
messed up.

527
00:34:55,467 --> 00:34:58,141
I wish I hadn't opened
Baa's locker.

528
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:05,406
You know, the one who
adopted me...

529
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,012
No, no...

530
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:16,116
""Where did I come from?""

531
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,780
""Who am I truly?""

532
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,645
""I think at every moment.""

533
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:38,217
""I see that I am torn.""

534
00:35:39,434 --> 00:35:46,977
""My prayer is silenced
in the noise.""

535
00:35:47,034 --> 00:35:50,709
""My soul cries out.""

536
00:35:50,767 --> 00:35:54,146
""Let me see you.""

537
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,609
""Heal my sorrow.""

538
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,238
""Oh, Lord.""

539
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,473
""Oh, Lord.""

540
00:36:03,534 --> 00:36:04,706
lndu.

541
00:36:05,967 --> 00:36:09,744
L...was born in a Muslim family.

542
00:36:11,967 --> 00:36:15,676
I am a Muslim by birth!

543
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,077
Bomb blast in Pune.
Today evening, in Vishrantwadi...

544
00:36:21,134 --> 00:36:24,274
lndu...
- These people are going too far.

545
00:36:24,534 --> 00:36:26,104
What happened?
- Watch this!

546
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:28,306
I don't know what these
Muslim folks want!

547
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:31,211
These people are instrumental in
doing everything wrong!

548
00:36:31,267 --> 00:36:34,646
Even in the police station 8 out
of 10 wanted guys are Muslims!

549
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,608
Whyjust 8 out of 10?
- ...person has...

550
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:38,874
10 out of 10 are Muslims!
What are you talking about?

551
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:41,208
The Opposition Leader
Mr. Kulkarni believes...

552
00:36:41,267 --> 00:36:43,941
...that this is orchestrated
by a Muslim group.

553
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:55,005
What about this incident?

554
00:36:56,634 --> 00:36:57,908
Yes.

555
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:00,010
I didn't do this.

556
00:37:01,434 --> 00:37:02,708
I didn't do this, either.

557
00:37:03,867 --> 00:37:05,710
But, we are being blamed for it.

558
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:09,579
Yes, but I am not
responsible for it.

559
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:13,239
Then who is responsible
for blaming us?

560
00:37:14,767 --> 00:37:17,008
If there is any bomb
blast in any place...

561
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,511
...or a terrorist attack...

562
00:37:18,567 --> 00:37:20,638
...we are accused at once.

563
00:37:21,834 --> 00:37:24,576
They never take a good
look at themselves.

564
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,979
Can I say something?

565
00:37:27,034 --> 00:37:29,378
I understood your mentality...

566
00:37:29,434 --> 00:37:33,109
...the day you asked me
to shift into a Muslim locality.

567
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,106
Panditji, don't mind, but I want
to ask you something.

568
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,574
Why do you people hate
us so virulently...

569
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,913
...right from your birth?

570
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:56,510
Mehmood Bhai, I am a Muslim, too.

571
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,573
Bhai, do you realize what
you are saying?

572
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:08,569
I was born a Muslim.

573
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:11,277
Really.

574
00:38:13,867 --> 00:38:15,642
What are you going
to do about this, now?

575
00:38:16,634 --> 00:38:19,444
Are you going to broadcast it?
Will you tell everybody?

576
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,646
Will you stick it up on
the notice board?

577
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:43,911
Get in.
- Why?

578
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,138
Is it because I am a Muslim?

579
00:38:46,434 --> 00:38:49,142
No, because you are hassled.

580
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,508
Tell me.
What's the matter?

581
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,209
Giving up one's own child!
One's own child!

582
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:22,480
If you didn't want the responsibility
then why have a child?

583
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,976
If in future you find out...

584
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,843
...that you were born in a Muslim
family...

585
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,504
...won't you be disturbed?

586
00:39:33,567 --> 00:39:35,274
I was born a Muslim.

587
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,305
I mean, you find out that...

588
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,381
...you were born in a Hindu
family, won't it bother you?

589
00:39:42,734 --> 00:39:44,270
Won't you feel disturbed?

590
00:39:46,034 --> 00:39:47,308
I get it.

591
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,507
I just want to find out
who was my dad.

592
00:39:53,367 --> 00:39:56,109
What is the name of
your biological father?

593
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,645
Meer Shaukat Ali.

594
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,038
Meer Shaukat Ali.

595
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:01,878
You are right.

596
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,977
Biological father.

597
00:40:05,634 --> 00:40:06,908
That's correct.

598
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,241
He's not my dad, he gave
birth to me and abandoned me!

599
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,643
How can he be my dad?

600
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,875
Biological father!

601
00:40:12,967 --> 00:40:14,207
That's right.

602
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,811
By tomorrow evening...

603
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,006
...can it be done?
Can you find out?

604
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:24,971
I'll try my level best.

605
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:28,010
I will try.

606
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,202
No, not at four, meet me
at six o'clock, tomorrow. - Oh!

607
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,075
Don't move.
- What is it?

608
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,037
You look good.

609
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:40,568
Flatterer.

610
00:40:40,634 --> 00:40:43,410
We will go to Himachal for
our honeymoon.

611
00:40:43,467 --> 00:40:45,913
Besides, it's horribly hot
here in June.

612
00:40:46,134 --> 00:40:48,478
We can go on a honeymoon
if we get married, first.

613
00:40:48,567 --> 00:40:49,875
Don't worry, Shraddha.

614
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:52,573
Just let me train dad
a bit, and after that...

615
00:40:52,634 --> 00:40:54,443
Yes, but hurry up, Amit!

616
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,480
You know Uncle Vyas wants...

617
00:40:56,534 --> 00:40:58,741
...his son to marry as soon
as possible!

618
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,704
And dad is also...

619
00:41:00,767 --> 00:41:04,010
He said, the day of appearance
is 2 weeks away and on that day...

620
00:41:04,367 --> 00:41:06,005
Shraddha, don't get tense.

621
00:41:06,334 --> 00:41:08,177
I have found something, today...

622
00:41:08,234 --> 00:41:09,907
...which will put dad in
a good mood.

623
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,243
It's a very old, very rare
clip from Manchala (film).

624
00:41:12,334 --> 00:41:13,711
Okay, very good.

625
00:41:14,067 --> 00:41:15,410
Now, just be quick...

626
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,535
...and get him around...
- I think, dad is here.

627
00:41:16,634 --> 00:41:18,204
Let me have him meet you too.

628
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,506
Dad!
Shraddha is online.

629
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,440
You're flirting online, too?
Nice.

630
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,170
Hello, dear.
- Hello, Uncle.

631
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,177
My dear, I'm not that kind of
orthodox father-in-law.

632
00:41:34,234 --> 00:41:36,339
Tell her, she has to be
free and uninhibited.

633
00:41:36,434 --> 00:41:38,573
Just be free.
- Yes.

634
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:41,373
But, Uncle, these are our
values.

635
00:41:41,434 --> 00:41:46,110
My dear, you are too young to get
caught up in the values' tangle.

636
00:41:46,467 --> 00:41:48,708
Both of you love each other, right?

637
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:50,041
Yes.
- You love each other, right?

638
00:41:50,367 --> 00:41:51,937
That's settled then!

639
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,707
And you know what they say...

640
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:56,839
...if the couple is willing, what will
Neelanand be able to do about it?

641
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,902
That's all very well, Uncle,
but...

642
00:42:00,967 --> 00:42:03,447
...I don't want to hassle my dad.

643
00:42:03,834 --> 00:42:06,644
Why can't you be a bit religious?
It's really simple.

644
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,237
Just pray a bit.

645
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,577
Apply the tilak (sect marking)
and wear a cap. That's all.

646
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:15,170
Well, if you kids want me to
wear a cap, I'll do that too.

647
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:16,940
Alright, then, we'll meet.

648
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,274
Okay. - Bye, dear.
- Okay, bye.

649
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:19,903
Bye, Uncle.
- Okay. - Hail Neelanand.

650
00:42:19,967 --> 00:42:21,105
Hail Neelanand.

651
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:24,512
If the girl says bye,
say bye darling, say, bye love.

652
00:42:24,567 --> 00:42:26,342
Why are you saying Neelanand?

653
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,943
If you do this at the
wedding night...

654
00:42:29,034 --> 00:42:31,412
...then, she'll grow a beard
and become an ascetic. Get it?

655
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,174
Come on, dad! That is ridiculous.
- ""Come on, dad!""

656
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:36,578
Dad.
- Yes.

657
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:39,546
I found a very rare, very old
clip of Manchala.

658
00:42:39,633 --> 00:42:41,078
What are you talking about?
- Yes.

659
00:42:41,133 --> 00:42:42,339
And you are telling me this, now?

660
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,110
""I'm the Sardar (leader) of
Bhangra, do you know, baby?""

661
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,670
""It's unending, do you know, baby?""

662
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,111
What's going on, dad?

663
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,942
In those days, Manchala...

664
00:42:54,033 --> 00:42:56,343
...was accused of trafficking
while conducting foreign tours.

665
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,311
That when this clip was taken.

666
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,812
He was an amazing singer.

667
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,470
I wonder where he is?

668
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,506
What is this?

669
00:43:04,867 --> 00:43:05,937
Dad!
_ Yes?

670
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,480
I took life membership of the
Neel Parivar (family) today.

671
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,680
They gave me a ten percent
discount.

672
00:43:10,767 --> 00:43:13,873
Besides, they gave me
the Neel granth free.

673
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:15,742
Wow.
- We must read this and obey it.

674
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,370
Obey it.

675
00:43:17,867 --> 00:43:20,438
The Neel Parivar's book is blue.

676
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,377
Does your Baba watch blue (adult)
films, too?

677
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:23,707
Dad!

678
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,507
Here.
Get your act together.

679
00:43:36,967 --> 00:43:38,207
Yes, Dharam Bhai.

680
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,678
Any news of the man
who created me?

681
00:43:40,767 --> 00:43:42,769
I have put some of my men
on the job.

682
00:43:42,867 --> 00:43:44,312
All of us are doing
our best, to find out.

683
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:46,574
God willing, we will know
soon enough.

684
00:43:46,967 --> 00:43:49,277
Okay, listen, let's meet
at home, tonight.

685
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,979
That's enough!

686
00:44:27,367 --> 00:44:28,573
Drink up.

687
00:44:28,634 --> 00:44:30,773
Mehmood Bhai? In Ahmadabad?

688
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,905
I have a permit.
- In that case, cheers.

689
00:44:37,567 --> 00:44:38,637
What is it?

690
00:44:40,367 --> 00:44:42,210
Is this Scotch?
- Yes.

691
00:44:42,767 --> 00:44:44,508
It's orange flavored.

692
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,637
I'll give you some that's lemon
flavored the next time you visit.

693
00:44:49,934 --> 00:44:51,504
Did you find out what happened?

694
00:44:53,034 --> 00:44:54,172
Your Muslim dad?

695
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:56,942
Not my dad, my biological father.

696
00:44:57,034 --> 00:44:58,911
Okay, cool down!

697
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,237
Let me tell you a story.

698
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,376
Listen, Dharam Bhai.

699
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:05,975
Your dad isn't...

700
00:45:06,334 --> 00:45:08,644
...what you think he is.

701
00:45:11,067 --> 00:45:12,478
What do you mean?

702
00:45:12,634 --> 00:45:15,410
I have a friend.
Dr. Farooque.

703
00:45:15,467 --> 00:45:17,777
Coincidentally,
he knows your father.

704
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,837
He was telling me that
your father...

705
00:45:21,034 --> 00:45:23,947
...was admitted to his clinic
a couple of times.

706
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,477
And according to Dr. Farooque...

707
00:45:26,867 --> 00:45:30,246
...your father is a very good man.

708
00:45:31,067 --> 00:45:33,570
When you were an infant...

709
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,473
...your mother expired.

710
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,570
In those days, your father
had a financial crisis at home.

711
00:45:41,567 --> 00:45:44,776
Later, he got hired
as a driver in Kuwait.

712
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,742
That's why, he had to leave.

713
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,971
He was helpless and so
he forced himself...

714
00:45:53,067 --> 00:45:56,105
...to hand you over to a relative.
He went to Kuwait.

715
00:45:57,767 --> 00:46:02,182
The custodian of the child
began to find it a burden.

716
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:05,375
That's when the relative
took the child...

717
00:46:05,734 --> 00:46:09,079
...that is you, and handed
you over to the orphanage.

718
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:15,083
Four years later, when your father
came back from Kuwait...

719
00:46:15,467 --> 00:46:18,311
...he found out about all this.

720
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,476
God knows, how he felt
at that time.

721
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:26,405
He went to the orphanage,
searching for you.

722
00:46:26,967 --> 00:46:30,847
But, Mr. Trivedi
had adopted you by then.

723
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:34,580
The authorities didn't even tell
him who the adoptive parents were.

724
00:46:34,767 --> 00:46:36,713
He was really traumatized.

725
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,010
Due to that sorrow,
he didn't even marry again.

726
00:46:42,067 --> 00:46:46,709
I believe, he has donated all
his worldly goods to charity.

727
00:46:46,867 --> 00:46:50,838
And these days, he is in the Khwaja
Garib Nawaz sanatorium...

728
00:46:51,167 --> 00:46:53,613
...at Sarkhej, living out
the last days of his life.

729
00:46:54,634 --> 00:46:57,706
Oh, God! Your story is
like a movie!

730
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,339
Alright, please wait.

731
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,411
Here he is.

732
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,412
Dad!
- What are you doing?

733
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,104
You will make me a sinner!

734
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,236
This is taboo.

735
00:47:14,267 --> 00:47:15,803
I am not your father.

736
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,379
Why are you calling me dad?

737
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,904
No, brother, he told me that...

738
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:25,177
I know. I understand
your feelings.

739
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:27,113
Come on.
I will explain it.

740
00:47:27,467 --> 00:47:31,210
Now, Meer Shaukat Ali is over 80
by the grace of God.

741
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,938
He's 80 years old?
- By the grace of God.

742
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,410
May God grant him
a long life, but...

743
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,447
...at present, he is not too well.

744
00:47:38,534 --> 00:47:39,979
That's why I am saying that...

745
00:47:40,034 --> 00:47:42,036
That is what I am saying too,
brother.

746
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:44,338
You see, a man who...

747
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,244
...has lived his entire life
chanting the name of God...

748
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:51,045
...and if he meets his only
son in the last days of his life...

749
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,172
...and he finds out his son
is not a Muslim.

750
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,406
Just think of how shocked
he will be!

751
00:47:57,467 --> 00:47:59,879
He will be terribly upset.
Right?

752
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,479
So, you mean, I can't meet him?
-You can meet him.

753
00:48:03,534 --> 00:48:05,480
Yes. -You can meet him.
I didn't say that.

754
00:48:05,567 --> 00:48:06,545
<i>Okay'</i>

755
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,774
But, I would like you to meet
him in a way that...

756
00:48:09,867 --> 00:48:12,108
...he feels happy.

757
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,945
He must not regret it.

758
00:48:14,033 --> 00:48:16,377
He should breathe his last
with pride.

759
00:48:16,467 --> 00:48:18,538
He must not die due to the shock.
Do you understand?

760
00:48:19,634 --> 00:48:22,046
Come this way.
- So, how can I meet him?

761
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:24,442
As a good Muslim.

762
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,712
You do know what a good Muslim
is like.

763
00:48:28,267 --> 00:48:30,304
Yes. What is a Muslim like?

764
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,708
They have long beards
up to here.

765
00:48:31,767 --> 00:48:33,303
They hitch up their trousers.

766
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,936
They have black marks on their
forehead and..

767
00:48:35,034 --> 00:48:36,707
Oh, God! May the Lord have mercy!

768
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,574
That means, you really don't know
anything about Muslims.

769
00:48:41,367 --> 00:48:43,506
Come along.
That's why I was telling you...

770
00:48:43,567 --> 00:48:46,514
...you should find out
all about Muslims...

771
00:48:46,567 --> 00:48:48,103
...and then come back here.

772
00:48:48,167 --> 00:48:50,443
God willing, you can meet
your father, then.

773
00:48:50,734 --> 00:48:52,042
Can't I just meet him?

774
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,046
I'll tell him that I am a Muslim.

775
00:48:54,133 --> 00:48:56,636
And that my name is Wasim Akram.

776
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,312
Or, Nawaz Sharif.
- You're lying in the abode of God.

777
00:48:59,734 --> 00:49:01,145
And in front of a clergyman!

778
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,907
Let's have some other name.

779
00:49:02,967 --> 00:49:06,244
First of all, it is not Nawaj,
it is Nawaz.

780
00:49:06,567 --> 00:49:08,513
Nawaz?
- Yes, Nawaz.

781
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,106
N awaz.

782
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,305
So, you can leave.
Learn the ways and customs.

783
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,380
Get some information.

784
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,680
And, then you can meet your
father.

785
00:49:18,134 --> 00:49:19,306
Good bye.

786
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,972
N awaz.

787
00:49:25,867 --> 00:49:27,107
N awaz.

788
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,836
Wretched clergyman!

789
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,038
He wants to make you a Muslim.

790
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,577
Don't worry.

791
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:41,580
This is your legal and fundamental
right to meet your father.

792
00:49:43,567 --> 00:49:45,410
I'll draft out a notice to him.

793
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,140
Under Section 340.
He'll get back on track at once.

794
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,441
Please don't issue any notice.

795
00:49:50,534 --> 00:49:52,571
Or everyone will notice me.

796
00:49:53,967 --> 00:49:58,109
If people find out that I was
born a Muslim...

797
00:49:58,733 --> 00:50:01,304
...then, that's the end of it.
I'll become a social outcast.

798
00:50:01,367 --> 00:50:03,005
The kids aren't married yet.

799
00:50:05,133 --> 00:50:09,138
Whatever has to be done has
to be done on the sly.

800
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,108
I wouldn't have scaled the wall and
come over at midnight, otherwise.

801
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,602
So, you will become a Muslim.

802
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:18,169
It really doesn't make
any difference to me.

803
00:50:18,234 --> 00:50:21,113
Make me a Muslim,
make me a wrestler or whatever.

804
00:50:21,767 --> 00:50:24,407
That's the very least I can do to
meet my dad.

805
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:27,340
Tell me something.

806
00:50:27,834 --> 00:50:30,940
You never met your father,
you've never seen him.

807
00:50:30,967 --> 00:50:32,310
There has been no connection.

808
00:50:32,367 --> 00:50:35,780
Why are you longing
to meet him?

809
00:50:39,634 --> 00:50:41,580
I want to see...

810
00:50:42,434 --> 00:50:45,574
...what is a father like?

811
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,342
I was four years old,
when my dad died.

812
00:50:50,067 --> 00:50:51,512
I have never seen him.

813
00:50:53,167 --> 00:50:55,238
Forget about that,
and just tell me something.

814
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,179
These Muslims ways and customs...

815
00:50:58,667 --> 00:51:00,510
...I mean, saying the prayers
and whatever.

816
00:51:01,033 --> 00:51:03,377
Rituals, customs, traditions,
call it what you will.

817
00:51:03,767 --> 00:51:06,247
Teach me that.
Okay?

818
00:51:06,634 --> 00:51:08,375
That's it, then!
- Marhaba!

819
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,637
What?
- Marhaba!

820
00:51:13,034 --> 00:51:14,274
Marhaba?

821
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,641
Cheers! Marhaba.
- Cheers.

822
00:51:22,867 --> 00:51:24,938
Here's the cap.

823
00:51:27,967 --> 00:51:29,537
Amazing.

824
00:51:30,234 --> 00:51:32,544
You look like a born Muslim.

825
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,906
Teach me the ways and customs
of a born Muslim.

826
00:51:36,967 --> 00:51:39,641
Then, I'll fit the bill to a T.

827
00:51:39,734 --> 00:51:42,374
Hold. Let me take a picture.

828
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:47,176
Keep the chin up. Smile now.
Yes, pleasant.

829
00:51:49,233 --> 00:51:50,735
Are we done?
- Done. - Yes?

830
00:51:50,834 --> 00:51:52,074
Be seated, please.

831
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,544
What should I do?
- That means, sit down.

832
00:51:56,334 --> 00:51:57,972
I'm sitting down.

833
00:51:58,034 --> 00:52:00,071
Tell me.
- Bismillah.

834
00:52:00,934 --> 00:52:03,608
So, let us begin
with the greeting.

835
00:52:03,767 --> 00:52:05,110
What is that?

836
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,111
I meant the greeting.

837
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,406
The greeting?
- Yes.

838
00:52:08,467 --> 00:52:09,810
What is that?
- Greeting.

839
00:52:09,867 --> 00:52:11,244
Greeting.
- Yes.

840
00:52:11,633 --> 00:52:12,976
Oh!

841
00:52:13,034 --> 00:52:15,014
Salam alaikum.
- Oh...

842
00:52:15,067 --> 00:52:17,104
That's where the best people
go wrong.

843
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:18,703
It's not salam alaikum.
- Then what?

844
00:52:18,767 --> 00:52:20,178
It's assalam alaikum.

845
00:52:20,234 --> 00:52:21,713
Assalam alaikum.

846
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,212
When you say that,
you get an answer...

847
00:52:24,267 --> 00:52:26,110
What?
- Walekum assalaam.

848
00:52:26,467 --> 00:52:28,777
Assalam alaikum
is turned the other way around?

849
00:52:28,834 --> 00:52:30,074
It's what we do.

850
00:52:30,167 --> 00:52:32,306
Namaste, and namaste back.
Ram Ram, and Ram Ram back.

851
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,971
Why does this get turned
the other way around?

852
00:52:35,034 --> 00:52:38,015
That means, peace be upon you.

853
00:52:38,067 --> 00:52:40,343
Yes.
- So, you get a return greeting.

854
00:52:40,433 --> 00:52:42,310
Which means, peace be upon you too.

855
00:52:43,367 --> 00:52:45,369
So you have to return it.
- Yes.

856
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,474
Alright.

857
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,872
Should we get on in life, or
are greetings all there is to it?

858
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:55,113
Pronounce life, the correct way.

859
00:52:55,534 --> 00:52:57,514
Why? If I don't will it shorten
my life?

860
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,012
Say it right!

861
00:53:41,067 --> 00:53:42,944
Where were you since so long?

862
00:53:44,033 --> 00:53:46,775
I was walking.

863
00:53:48,567 --> 00:53:50,012
Walking?
- Yes.

864
00:53:50,467 --> 00:53:51,810
At one in the morning?

865
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,372
Well, I have acidity.

866
00:53:53,433 --> 00:53:54,776
The doctor told me
after eating...

867
00:53:54,867 --> 00:53:56,778
Tell me the truth.

868
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,746
Where did you go
and who were you with?

869
00:53:59,867 --> 00:54:01,369
I was with Mehmood.

870
00:54:01,467 --> 00:54:02,673
What? Mehmood?

871
00:54:03,767 --> 00:54:06,179
Mehmood? I was with the ghost!

872
00:54:06,267 --> 00:54:09,510
I was with the ghost.
- Stop joking, please.

873
00:54:09,967 --> 00:54:11,310
What about your clothes?

874
00:54:13,867 --> 00:54:17,679
Yes, I slipped a bit
while walking.

875
00:54:17,767 --> 00:54:19,440
You're not hiding something
from me, right?

876
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,379
What can I hide from you, darling?
- Then, swear to me.

877
00:54:22,833 --> 00:54:24,471
I swear to you.

878
00:54:24,834 --> 00:54:29,283
Darling, men change
as they age.

879
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,010
I went to get a surprise for you.

880
00:54:33,067 --> 00:54:34,774
I climbed the tree
and I slipped.

881
00:54:40,067 --> 00:54:42,638
You always convince me
with a surprise. - See?

882
00:54:42,867 --> 00:54:44,540
Now, go on.
- Yes.

883
00:54:45,667 --> 00:54:47,305
And, listen.
- Yes?

884
00:54:47,667 --> 00:54:49,874
I will also give you a
surprise, tomorrow morning.

885
00:54:50,234 --> 00:54:51,645
Really?

886
00:54:52,933 --> 00:54:54,742
<i>O</i> kaY-
<i>O</i> kaY-

887
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:02,573
Drink up the juice.
- Where is the surprise?

888
00:55:03,734 --> 00:55:07,045
This isn't a surprise.
This is Neelanand's cap.

889
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,977
Dad, the surprise is a bit late.

890
00:55:09,034 --> 00:55:11,275
This is not a cap, this is the
Neel headgear.

891
00:55:11,367 --> 00:55:12,846
It's worn
so you can look religious.

892
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:16,279
It's an easy way to look religious.

893
00:55:16,334 --> 00:55:19,042
No prayers, or reading the texts.
No sacred duty or meditation.

894
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,580
Wear the cap and become religious
in an instant.

895
00:55:21,634 --> 00:55:23,705
How do I look?
Do I look religious?

896
00:55:23,767 --> 00:55:25,440
Do I look like a Pundit (priest)?

897
00:55:25,934 --> 00:55:28,676
How can I look like one?
My face is non religious!

898
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,041
This is amazing.

899
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:33,172
No matter what the religion
they make you wear the cap.

900
00:55:34,667 --> 00:55:36,874
Who is it?
- I think, the priest is here.

901
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:38,605
The priest?

902
00:55:38,667 --> 00:55:40,613
That's the surprise.
- What?

903
00:55:41,267 --> 00:55:45,113
Amit would like you to learn
about religion from the priest.

904
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,469
It will be useful, when you have
to meet Swamiji.

905
00:55:47,533 --> 00:55:49,240
Listen to me...
- It's okay.

906
00:55:49,734 --> 00:55:53,375
Oh, God! This is a terrible
surprise.

907
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:57,382
Aren't you the same man?
I am true, but not right.

908
00:55:57,434 --> 00:56:00,574
No! Don't misunderstand.

909
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:03,147
I am true and I am right!

910
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:06,238
I am fine, all over. Everywhere.
- Yes.

911
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:10,973
Om.
-Om.

912
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,738
So, let's start with the first lesson.
Say, Shree Ganeshay Namah.

913
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,245
Shree Ganeshay Namah.

914
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,939
First, we must
perform the cleansing.

915
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,209
So, you need to close your eyes
and nose and drink this. Go on.

916
00:56:26,267 --> 00:56:27,769
What is this?
- Drink it up.

917
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,805
What is that?
- It's cow urine.

918
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,712
Cow urine?
- Yes.

919
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,207
It's essential to cleanse
your inner soul.

920
00:56:40,767 --> 00:56:43,714
If you go out and eat anything else,
you must cleanse yourself, again.

921
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,376
Come on, focus.
Say after me.

922
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,579
Om.
-Om...

923
00:56:49,934 --> 00:56:51,811
Now, we will perform Wazu.
- Wazu.

924
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,471
Cleaning, as in ablutions.
- I saw it on the CD.

925
00:56:54,533 --> 00:56:56,740
Yes! How is it to be done?

926
00:56:57,067 --> 00:57:00,844
Rinse the mouth, cleaning of
mouth and face.

927
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,744
And then, the arms.
- Like that.

928
00:57:03,933 --> 00:57:05,674
The prayer mat has been set out.

929
00:57:05,734 --> 00:57:10,046
Place both hands behind
your ears, like this.

930
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,039
Alright?
Then...

931
00:57:15,934 --> 00:57:17,311
...do this.

932
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,746
This is called the intention
to pray.

933
00:57:19,933 --> 00:57:21,913
The intention to pray.
- Yes.

934
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:26,278
(Arabic prayers)

935
00:57:28,634 --> 00:57:30,636
(Arabic prayers)

936
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:37,507
(Arabic prayers)

937
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,542
Dad, why are you looking
at them so intently?

938
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,380
I am just looking at how
he does that.

939
00:57:47,834 --> 00:57:49,040
The prayers?

940
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:51,135
Yes, that's right. The prayers,
the veneration. The ritual.

941
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:53,043
I wanted to see how they
perform it.

942
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,180
Come on, sit.
Let me drop you to college.

943
00:57:55,267 --> 00:57:57,713
Dad, it is 6 in the evening...

944
00:57:57,934 --> 00:57:59,538
College is out.

945
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,479
I am going to go home.
- That's what I said. Sit.

946
00:58:02,567 --> 00:58:04,103
Come on.

947
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,875
(Arabic prayers)

948
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,008
I can't do this.

949
00:58:12,934 --> 00:58:15,972
I can't do this. It's fine right up
to the intention to pray.

950
00:58:16,033 --> 00:58:18,980
But, saying the words is hard.

951
00:58:19,034 --> 00:58:20,775
No, you can do it!
You can do it.

952
00:58:20,867 --> 00:58:22,540
What you have to do is...

953
00:58:22,633 --> 00:58:24,271
...when you are standing
in the mosque...

954
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:28,076
...then, you follow
what the man before you does.

955
00:58:28,867 --> 00:58:30,175
Follow the leader.

956
00:58:30,767 --> 00:58:32,075
Follow.
- Follow.

957
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,978
Now go down like this.
Don't stop.

958
00:58:35,034 --> 00:58:37,776
Nothing to be said, right?
- No, nothing!

959
00:58:38,767 --> 00:58:41,373
Hey! What are you doing?
- What?

960
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,210
It's really dusty, I'm
getting rid of it.

961
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:47,240
It's all so dusty!

962
00:58:47,534 --> 00:58:49,514
I just don't understand him, now.

963
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,880
You know those fakirs
who carry peacock feathers?

964
00:58:54,967 --> 00:58:57,243
They throw up the clouds of
loban (frankincense) smoke.

965
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,639
What should I do about them?
Touch their feet?

966
00:58:59,734 --> 00:59:01,111
No!

967
00:59:01,434 --> 00:59:04,608
Islam forbids it.
You can't touch someone's feet.

968
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,702
You don't bow down to anyone.

969
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,704
But, if you feel an intense
desire...

970
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,807
...then, you must greet
the person first.

971
00:59:13,334 --> 00:59:14,540
And then...

972
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,737
...you may kiss the person's hand.

973
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:18,512
What do you mean?

974
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,805
I mean, you kiss.

975
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,436
Kiss! Then why don't you
say that?

976
00:59:23,534 --> 00:59:25,639
Why are you making it
sound so heavy?

977
00:59:25,734 --> 00:59:27,407
That's how it is said.

978
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,241
Here, you hold the hand like this.

979
00:59:29,334 --> 00:59:31,905
Yes, right!
- Kissing. - Kiss it.

980
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,204
Hello.
- Salamalaikum.

981
00:59:34,533 --> 00:59:35,910
Salam.

982
00:59:36,634 --> 00:59:38,113
Greetings.
- Greetings.

983
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:39,737
Greetings.
- Yes.

984
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,575
Do come in.
- Come in.

985
00:59:42,367 --> 00:59:44,847
Repeat after me.
As you stride along..

986
00:59:45,134 --> 00:59:46,807
You walk the world...

987
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:47,970
Listen carefully.

988
00:59:48,034 --> 00:59:49,638
As you stride along...

989
00:59:49,734 --> 00:59:51,111
As you walk...

990
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:53,613
As you stride along,
lighting up the path...

991
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:54,974
Lighting up the...

992
00:59:55,067 --> 00:59:56,444
Lighting...

993
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:00,973
Joseph and...

994
01:00:02,967 --> 01:00:04,378
What is this tongue twister?

995
01:00:05,567 --> 01:00:07,478
Say it right!

996
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,576
Tongue twister.
- Tongue twister.

997
01:00:10,634 --> 01:00:12,136
This is just a waste of time.

998
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:14,180
No! You did it again!

999
01:00:14,234 --> 01:00:17,340
You have to enunciate right.

1000
01:00:17,767 --> 01:00:20,748
Alright.
- Like that.

1001
01:00:20,967 --> 01:00:23,345
That's it.
- Okay.

1002
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,239
Repeat after me. Resident
of Kailash and Kashi...

1003
01:00:27,167 --> 01:00:28,612
Resident of Khailash
and Khashi...

1004
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:30,112
What's wrong with your throat?

1005
01:00:30,534 --> 01:00:33,777
Say it clearly,
enunciate properly.

1006
01:00:33,833 --> 01:00:36,177
Don't pronounce it with Kh.
- Kh...

1007
01:00:36,367 --> 01:00:39,541
K...the residents of Kailash
and Kashi. - Kailash..

1008
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,739
And go down on the knees.
- No speaking, right?

1009
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,041
No! On your knees.

1010
01:00:44,134 --> 01:00:46,580
Bend, bow.

1011
01:00:47,267 --> 01:00:51,443
Look, this is the complete
bow. Do this.

1012
01:00:53,267 --> 01:00:54,837
What are you doing?

1013
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,402
This is the standing bow.

1014
01:00:56,467 --> 01:00:57,969
Bow as you stand.

1015
01:00:58,067 --> 01:00:59,478
I am standing on my legs
and I'm bowing.

1016
01:00:59,534 --> 01:01:01,172
A standing bow.

1017
01:01:01,267 --> 01:01:02,974
Why don't you read it?

1018
01:01:04,867 --> 01:01:07,143
When Joseph and his comrades...

1019
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,107
When Joseph and his comrades...

1020
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,043
...left the ship to
embark on the island...

1021
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:13,307
...the cruel Jalaal stood there
leering...

1022
01:01:13,367 --> 01:01:14,937
...while standing
tied up in chains.

1023
01:01:16,467 --> 01:01:18,140
That's a lot of emphasis.

1024
01:01:18,234 --> 01:01:19,474
Doesn't it hurt your throat?

1025
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,535
A drink!

1026
01:01:21,633 --> 01:01:24,113
Striding along,
lighting up the path...

1027
01:01:24,167 --> 01:01:27,080
Lighting...

1028
01:01:27,134 --> 01:01:28,772
Sir, please pay attention first.
- Yes.

1029
01:01:28,867 --> 01:01:30,107
Striding along, lighting up
the path.

1030
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:31,475
Striding along...

1031
01:01:31,534 --> 01:01:33,775
Striding along,
lighting up the path.

1032
01:01:33,867 --> 01:01:36,473
Brandishing the trident
and the crescent moon...

1033
01:01:36,533 --> 01:01:38,410
Don't chatter.
Don't talk nonsense.

1034
01:01:38,467 --> 01:01:41,175
Go and wash your face in a
dirty water canal.

1035
01:01:41,233 --> 01:01:43,736
What are you...
I'm going. - Get going!

1036
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:45,745
Get going!
- I'm leaving. - Dharam!

1037
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,507
I am leaving.

1038
01:01:47,567 --> 01:01:50,741
I will never come back!
He's insane!

1039
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,576
Hello, may I speak
to Dr. Chunnawala?

1040
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,573
Yes, from your
psychiatry department.

1041
01:02:25,833 --> 01:02:28,575
Get back a bit.
Scoot back!

1042
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:34,772
Sir, please move a bit forward.

1043
01:02:35,367 --> 01:02:36,573
A bit more.

1044
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,011
Here you are.

1045
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,070
Eat it.

1046
01:02:57,167 --> 01:03:00,011
I am being religious for you.
Eat up. - No.

1047
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:03,113
You promise like a politician and
forget it, later.

1048
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:05,477
What did I forget? - You haven't
been to the ashram since two days.

1049
01:03:05,567 --> 01:03:07,478
My son, I have to go to the
market early in the morning.

1050
01:03:07,567 --> 01:03:09,706
You can't get fresh produce
after 9 AM.

1051
01:03:09,767 --> 01:03:10,905
No, it's an excuse.

1052
01:03:10,967 --> 01:03:12,378
Come with me to the ashram
today.

1053
01:03:12,467 --> 01:03:13,741
Neeleshwarji will be there.

1054
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,041
At least greet him.
Baba!

1055
01:03:16,134 --> 01:03:19,445
Listen! - He must see
you attend the veneration.

1056
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:22,112
Higher.
- Wait till the veneration is complete.

1057
01:03:22,167 --> 01:03:24,238
Please?
- That's right!

1058
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:26,778
That's right.
Keep it right there.

1059
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,446
Hello?
- Assalam alaikum.

1060
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,844
I am calling from the Khwaja Garib
Nawaz sanatorium. - Yes.

1061
01:03:33,934 --> 01:03:36,915
I thought, I should tell you
your dad is unwell.

1062
01:03:37,267 --> 01:03:39,406
What do you mean?
- He's critical""

1063
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,440
You mean, he is really ill.
- Yes, he is.

1064
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,141
Then, I will come there, Ali Bhai.
- No, listen to me.

1065
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,907
Yes?
- Come during prayers.

1066
01:03:46,967 --> 01:03:48,503
He should not find out.

1067
01:03:48,567 --> 01:03:50,046
He won't know.

1068
01:03:50,367 --> 01:03:52,005
What is it?
- What?

1069
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,104
It's a call from the shop.

1070
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,677
So, you're not staying for
the veneration?

1071
01:03:55,767 --> 01:03:57,872
I will attend the
evening veneration, okay?

1072
01:03:57,934 --> 01:03:59,379
Dad, is there any problem?

1073
01:03:59,467 --> 01:04:01,743
It's nothing, it's just
about the business.

1074
01:04:02,033 --> 01:04:03,569
Why don't you go?

1075
01:04:03,667 --> 01:04:06,978
That's right.
Keep it right there.

1076
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:07,580
Listen, Lord, I am at your abode.

1077
01:05:08,334 --> 01:05:13,079
At least let me meet my dad, now.
Please? Atleast once.

1078
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,979
Salam alaikum.

1079
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:28,945
Walaikum salam.

1080
01:05:29,034 --> 01:05:30,445
Shame on you!

1081
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,980
How could you be so rude
while praying?

1082
01:05:33,034 --> 01:05:34,707
You lied in the abode of the Lord!

1083
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:35,972
Get him out of here, right now.

1084
01:05:36,034 --> 01:05:38,480
Listen to me, my dad
doesn't have much time.

1085
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:40,513
Let me meet him.
- The law is the law.

1086
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,602
A non Muslim can't go in
and that's that.

1087
01:05:42,667 --> 01:05:44,647
Take him away!
- You know I am a Muslim.

1088
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,008
I am a born Muslim.

1089
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,774
Sir, you know it.
Sir...

1090
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,038
lam a Muslim, sir!
- Come on.

1091
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,040
Alright, fine.

1092
01:06:25,867 --> 01:06:28,040
Amit, what are you saying?
- Mom, it's true!

1093
01:06:28,134 --> 01:06:29,613
I saw Dad myself.

1094
01:06:29,667 --> 01:06:32,671
He was standing outside the mosque
amongst the Muslims wearing the cap.

1095
01:06:32,734 --> 01:06:35,271
For the sake of my father
and my son...

1096
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:37,278
...and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

1097
01:06:37,367 --> 01:06:40,871
Oh, God, forgive them, for they
know not what I do.

1098
01:06:41,734 --> 01:06:43,077
What is going on, Dharam?

1099
01:06:43,134 --> 01:06:45,774
Amit said, you went to the mosque.

1100
01:06:45,834 --> 01:06:47,575
And you were behaving
like a proper Muslim!

1101
01:06:47,667 --> 01:06:50,147
I even went to church.
He didn't see that.

1102
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:54,104
Jesus never fails.
But, has he passed?

1103
01:06:54,167 --> 01:06:56,204
Dad, why are you doing this?

1104
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,779
For the sake of my father,
my son and the Holy Spirit, dear.

1105
01:06:59,834 --> 01:07:03,839
I would like to ask God, Allah,
the Almighty.

1106
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:07,143
If you are one,
why are there so many variations?

1107
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,009
Why these different
departments?

1108
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,936
Due to your identification...

1109
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,276
...competition has been
caused in your creation.

1110
01:07:13,367 --> 01:07:15,745
I want solution for this confusion.

1111
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,610
Please! Please, give me a
solution... - Listen!

1112
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:20,340
...to this confusion!
Please!

1113
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,006
This is an action or an opinion of
an inadequate reason.

1114
01:07:23,067 --> 01:07:24,569
And this is all
because of you, Amit.

1115
01:07:24,667 --> 01:07:26,772
Ever since you forced him to
be religious...

1116
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:28,210
...dad has become like this.

1117
01:07:28,267 --> 01:07:29,746
I talked to Dr. Chunawala.

1118
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,007
He said, just leave him alone.
It will be alright.

1119
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:34,205
So, just stop harassing him.

1120
01:07:35,867 --> 01:07:38,108
Hail Lord Shiva.

1121
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,743
Come, sister.

1122
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,512
Your horoscope is excellent.

1123
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:45,814
But, there is some unrest
at present.

1124
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:49,372
Saturn has adversely
aspected the seventh house.

1125
01:07:49,434 --> 01:07:52,381
So, you could have problems with
your husband.

1126
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:55,273
What kind of problems, priest?

1127
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,204
Please explain.

1128
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,805
I mean, is it work, money...
- Sister...

1129
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:01,710
...there are other spheres
apart from these.

1130
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,279
Such as the sphere
of moral character.

1131
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:05,745
Character?

1132
01:08:06,267 --> 01:08:08,247
Are you saying,
there's another woman?

1133
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:09,643
Hail Lord Shiva!

1134
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,237
Another woman?
Or perhaps another...

1135
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,812
The trouble is in the
seventh house.

1136
01:08:15,867 --> 01:08:17,972
The problem is, that
being a man, the first house...

1137
01:08:18,067 --> 01:08:20,069
...he is involved
with a male planet.

1138
01:08:20,134 --> 01:08:22,614
Don't ask me any more
and put me in a moral dilemma.

1139
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,412
In fact, focus on your
husband's...

1140
01:08:25,467 --> 01:08:27,208
...strange behavior.

1141
01:08:28,467 --> 01:08:31,744
Priest, can't anything be done
about this?

1142
01:08:32,267 --> 01:08:33,541
Listen.

1143
01:08:34,834 --> 01:08:37,075
I have stopped solving
such problems, these days.

1144
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:39,147
Alright, then.
Bless you.

1145
01:09:20,034 --> 01:09:21,377
What are you looking at?

1146
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,647
I am doing something important.
You won't understand.

1147
01:09:25,967 --> 01:09:27,640
I know it very well!

1148
01:09:27,734 --> 01:09:29,839
What's going on with you
and Mehmood.

1149
01:09:29,933 --> 01:09:31,344
I know all about it.

1150
01:09:32,967 --> 01:09:34,378
Who told you?

1151
01:09:34,934 --> 01:09:36,607
What has to be said about that?

1152
01:09:36,667 --> 01:09:38,305
Can't I see it?

1153
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:42,212
I have watched you scale
the wall to disgrace yourself.

1154
01:09:43,634 --> 01:09:46,478
Indu, I was going
to tell you, but...

1155
01:09:46,934 --> 01:09:48,845
How could I tell you?

1156
01:09:49,767 --> 01:09:51,246
Oh, Goddess!

1157
01:09:52,667 --> 01:09:54,476
Why did this happen to me?

1158
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:57,010
Why was I fated to deal
with this?

1159
01:09:57,867 --> 01:09:59,244
Go away.

1160
01:09:59,334 --> 01:10:00,779
Leave and go to Mehmood!

1161
01:10:00,834 --> 01:10:03,371
You like him, right?
Just go to him.

1162
01:10:04,234 --> 01:10:07,545
What? I like Mehmood?

1163
01:10:10,234 --> 01:10:11,975
Are you insane?

1164
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:13,973
What do you mean, I like him?

1165
01:10:14,167 --> 01:10:16,238
I am not gay, you fool!

1166
01:10:16,967 --> 01:10:20,073
I am straight, straight
as an arrow.

1167
01:10:20,567 --> 01:10:22,843
Why do go to meet him
on the sly, then?

1168
01:10:23,267 --> 01:10:24,405
For you.

1169
01:10:24,467 --> 01:10:26,242
To Mehmod's place?
- Yes.

1170
01:10:26,634 --> 01:10:30,207
We are going to celebrate our 25th
wedding anniversary after a week.

1171
01:10:30,934 --> 01:10:34,279
I want to take you on a honeymoon.

1172
01:10:34,367 --> 01:10:37,007
It will be even more awesome
than the first time around.

1173
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:41,412
Why do you have to visit
Mehmood at home for that?

1174
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,741
I have to!

1175
01:10:44,834 --> 01:10:48,179
He has some Yunani medicines.

1176
01:10:48,234 --> 01:10:50,771
It adds to a man's vitality.
Okay?

1177
01:10:50,934 --> 01:10:53,005
Yes, so, you could go about
it the regular way.

1178
01:10:53,267 --> 01:10:56,111
Why scale the wall?
- I wanted to surprise you!

1179
01:10:56,167 --> 01:10:59,171
To surprise you,
I'd scale his wall...

1180
01:10:59,267 --> 01:11:01,907
...as well as the Great
Wall of China, too!

1181
01:11:02,501 --> 01:11:04,606
Swear to me.
- It's true.

1182
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:06,543
I want proof.
- Don't believe me?

1183
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,308
Promise me.
- One moment.

1184
01:11:12,567 --> 01:11:16,379
First, use and then believe it.
Come along.

1185
01:11:18,501 --> 01:11:19,878
Don't laugh!

1186
01:11:19,934 --> 01:11:21,914
It was a narrow escape.

1187
01:11:23,234 --> 01:11:24,907
Once the Maulvi agrees...

1188
01:11:24,967 --> 01:11:27,709
...I will meet my dad
and this charade will stop.

1189
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,247
You overruled my idea of
going to court.

1190
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:35,076
If you hadn't done that,
that wretched clergyman...

1191
01:11:35,134 --> 01:11:36,943
...would have been set right
in no time.

1192
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,536
What do you think?

1193
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,547
Am I ready to meet him?
- Yes.

1194
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:46,276
Your Muslim customs,
formalities, etiquettes, life...

1195
01:11:46,334 --> 01:11:49,110
...have I imbibed all of that?

1196
01:11:49,167 --> 01:11:51,113
You're alight.
- Okay.

1197
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:54,010
But, don't pronounce etiquettes
with a slur.

1198
01:11:57,701 --> 01:12:00,113
What is this?
- ...to celebrate the aqiqah...

1199
01:12:00,167 --> 01:12:02,340
Great! He is my client.

1200
01:12:02,434 --> 01:12:04,505
Mr. Akbar Zariwala.

1201
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,080
It is an invite to an aqiqah
(ritual after child's birth).

1202
01:12:07,334 --> 01:12:08,369
Come with me.

1203
01:12:08,467 --> 01:12:11,311
It's experience on the ground
and you will learn from it.

1204
01:12:11,601 --> 01:12:13,137
What's an aqiqah?

1205
01:12:13,234 --> 01:12:15,646
You will know, when you get there.

1206
01:12:16,967 --> 01:12:19,846
Don't get me into trouble.
- No! Aqiqah.

1207
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,071
Aqiqah,
<i>'</i> Aqiqah,

1208
01:12:22,267 --> 01:12:24,611
Aqiqah!
Forget it.

1209
01:12:24,867 --> 01:12:26,608
Salam alaikum.
How are you?

1210
01:12:26,667 --> 01:12:28,510
You've arranged everything
very well. - Yes.

1211
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,077
I believe you've opened
a new shop.

1212
01:12:31,667 --> 01:12:33,305
God has been kind.

1213
01:12:33,467 --> 01:12:35,003
Did you hear about Rafique?

1214
01:12:35,067 --> 01:12:36,944
Where is your aunt?

1215
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:40,042
Amazing!
- Thank you.

1216
01:12:40,334 --> 01:12:42,109
Assalam alaikum.
- Walaikum salam.

1217
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,474
All well?

1218
01:12:43,534 --> 01:12:45,844
Salam alaikum, Sir.
- Walaikum salam. All well?

1219
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:46,970
God is kind.
- Alright.

1220
01:12:47,034 --> 01:12:48,877
This is a special friend of mine.

1221
01:12:48,934 --> 01:12:50,072
A very close and dear friend.

1222
01:12:50,167 --> 01:12:52,010
Do take very good care of him.

1223
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:53,512
Of course.

1224
01:12:53,601 --> 01:12:54,875
This is Ejaz.
- Hello.

1225
01:12:54,934 --> 01:12:56,379
This is Sahir.

1226
01:12:58,134 --> 01:12:59,670
I will be back.
- Hello.

1227
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:00,776
I'll be right back.

1228
01:13:01,767 --> 01:13:03,940
So, Sir...
- Hello, ma'am.

1229
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,378
Kids these days ask the most
weird questions.

1230
01:13:06,434 --> 01:13:09,005
It is difficult to answer them.
- Yes.

1231
01:13:09,434 --> 01:13:12,904
Just yesterday my son was
saying...

1232
01:13:12,967 --> 01:13:15,675
...that, if you can't perform Wazu...

1233
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:17,269
...will the prayer be accepted?

1234
01:13:17,367 --> 01:13:19,347
Now tell me, what should I say?

1235
01:13:28,867 --> 01:13:30,972
It hurts to sit like this.

1236
01:13:31,801 --> 01:13:36,079
No, those who find it tough to sit
in this posture...

1237
01:13:36,134 --> 01:13:38,705
...they have another option.
Yes.

1238
01:13:38,767 --> 01:13:41,270
They can sit on a chair
and perform their prayers.

1239
01:13:41,367 --> 01:13:43,574
The intention has to be pure.
- Right.

1240
01:13:44,767 --> 01:13:48,943
You can perform prayers
while sitting in a chair.

1241
01:13:49,534 --> 01:13:51,138
What?
- Yes.

1242
01:13:51,201 --> 01:13:53,181
Make sure your intentions
are good.

1243
01:13:53,234 --> 01:13:55,407
If you are good, then
anything is good for you.

1244
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,206
Wonderful!
- Well said.

1245
01:13:58,300 --> 01:13:59,973
Amazing.
- You bet.

1246
01:14:01,534 --> 01:14:04,572
I don't know you.
lam Shahzeb Khan.

1247
01:14:04,667 --> 01:14:06,510
What's your good name?

1248
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:08,738
Sharif Khan.

1249
01:14:09,801 --> 01:14:12,543
You seem to be wise and
learned man.

1250
01:14:12,634 --> 01:14:15,513
Tell me, is it a sin to
grow one's hair?

1251
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,104
Mom!

1252
01:14:24,701 --> 01:14:26,942
What does your mom
say about this?

1253
01:14:29,467 --> 01:14:32,471
She says, if it is 0k, so be it.

1254
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:34,980
Because, heaven is at her feet.

1255
01:14:35,067 --> 01:14:38,344
Wonderful!
- Well said.

1256
01:14:38,601 --> 01:14:40,080
Sir, tell me.

1257
01:14:40,134 --> 01:14:42,614
Which is the true path to heaven?

1258
01:14:44,767 --> 01:14:46,110
Where do you live?

1259
01:14:46,434 --> 01:14:48,812
There is a road which goes
left from Kalawar...

1260
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:51,107
...that's the road
to my humble abode.

1261
01:14:51,167 --> 01:14:54,910
That's it,
that's the road to heaven.

1262
01:14:55,534 --> 01:14:59,004
The road to your home
is the road to heaven.

1263
01:14:59,067 --> 01:15:02,207
Well said!
- Wonderful! - Great!

1264
01:15:02,267 --> 01:15:03,905
Amazing.
- Come this way.

1265
01:15:04,001 --> 01:15:06,038
Sir, this is my wife.

1266
01:15:06,301 --> 01:15:07,837
This is our dear princess.

1267
01:15:08,134 --> 01:15:09,477
Bless her, please.

1268
01:15:10,934 --> 01:15:12,504
How can I bless her?

1269
01:15:14,134 --> 01:15:17,980
Yes! What's true is right.

1270
01:15:18,734 --> 01:15:20,338
Well said!
- Amazing.

1271
01:15:20,434 --> 01:15:22,539
What is true is right.

1272
01:15:22,634 --> 01:15:24,409
Amazing, well said.

1273
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:27,072
Come, let's have dinner.

1274
01:15:27,134 --> 01:15:28,875
Let's begin with God's grace,
don't say let's eat.

1275
01:15:28,934 --> 01:15:31,881
Beautiful!
- This way, please.

1276
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:33,446
Come along.
- This way.

1277
01:15:37,934 --> 01:15:41,040
The beard is off.
You're happy.

1278
01:15:41,734 --> 01:15:44,408
But, I swear, at the party...

1279
01:15:44,501 --> 01:15:47,141
...you were the
center of attraction.

1280
01:15:47,567 --> 01:15:49,240
God saved me.

1281
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,070
Tell me something.

1282
01:15:51,434 --> 01:15:53,539
You left me with strangers.

1283
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,477
Why were you chasing that lady?

1284
01:15:55,534 --> 01:15:57,878
No! Don't get me wrong.

1285
01:15:58,067 --> 01:16:00,570
She's not a stranger.
- Who is she, then?

1286
01:16:01,234 --> 01:16:04,238
She is my wife.
She left me to stay with her family.

1287
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:06,744
God! I am sorry.

1288
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,575
I had no idea.
Sorry.

1289
01:16:09,734 --> 01:16:12,544
Do you think,
I will pass this test?

1290
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:16,207
Of course!
You were amazing.

1291
01:16:16,267 --> 01:16:19,612
If you can repeat it for that
wretched clergyman...

1292
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:21,340
...we will win the battle.

1293
01:16:22,034 --> 01:16:23,377
Say amen to that.

1294
01:16:23,634 --> 01:16:25,045
Amen.
- Amen to that.

1295
01:16:33,534 --> 01:16:37,346
<i>Zia-uhhaq...</i>

1296
01:16:38,467 --> 01:16:39,878
Mehmood.
- Yes.

1297
01:16:41,534 --> 01:16:43,172
Hello.

1298
01:16:43,934 --> 01:16:45,845
Hello.
- Hello.

1299
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:47,277
Sit down, please.

1300
01:16:47,534 --> 01:16:48,808
Sir.

1301
01:16:50,601 --> 01:16:52,774
Tell me.
-Sir...

1302
01:16:53,334 --> 01:16:58,750
...I am Mehmood Nazeem
Ali Shah Khan Bahadur.

1303
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:00,101
Wonderful.

1304
01:17:00,167 --> 01:17:03,671
I am connected to the royal family
of the kingdom of Junagadh.

1305
01:17:03,767 --> 01:17:05,178
That is wonderful.

1306
01:17:05,467 --> 01:17:08,004
Dharampal Trivedi
is my dear friend.

1307
01:17:08,101 --> 01:17:09,136
Hello.
- Sit.

1308
01:17:09,201 --> 01:17:12,307
By a mere coincidence,
your president...

1309
01:17:12,734 --> 01:17:16,011
...Saeed lmtiaz Hussein is also
my dear friend.

1310
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,207
We were just playing polo the day
before yesterday.

1311
01:17:18,267 --> 01:17:19,974
For God's sake.

1312
01:17:20,667 --> 01:17:24,308
He passed away two years ago.

1313
01:17:25,067 --> 01:17:27,547
It's an old plaque, you see?

1314
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:30,508
May God grant him heavenly peace.

1315
01:17:30,767 --> 01:17:32,974
He still visits me in dreams.

1316
01:17:33,067 --> 01:17:36,344
I was playing polo with him
in my dreams yesterday.

1317
01:17:41,467 --> 01:17:47,179
Sir, I am a complete Muslim, now.

1318
01:17:47,667 --> 01:17:50,011
My friend has been
very dedicated...

1319
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,273
...and embraced Islam.

1320
01:17:53,367 --> 01:17:56,348
But, don't worry.
I will find out in my own way.

1321
01:17:56,734 --> 01:17:57,940
Of course.

1322
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,311
I am sure, you know the
five must dos for Muslims.

1323
01:18:02,134 --> 01:18:03,807
Five?
- Duties?

1324
01:18:03,867 --> 01:18:05,403
Five, yes.

1325
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:10,209
The Kalma.
- Very good.

1326
01:18:10,867 --> 01:18:12,244
Namaz.

1327
01:18:14,867 --> 01:18:16,141
Roza.

1328
01:18:16,934 --> 01:18:18,242
Jakaat.

1329
01:18:18,734 --> 01:18:19,906
Haj.

1330
01:18:19,967 --> 01:18:21,947
Five. Haj.
- Very good!

1331
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,240
Well done.

1332
01:18:24,067 --> 01:18:25,705
Recite the first Kalma, please.

1333
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:28,947
(Arabic prayers)

1334
01:18:29,401 --> 01:18:30,903
The first Kalma.
- Go for it.

1335
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,310
Yes, no problem.
It's been said. - The Kalma.

1336
01:18:33,634 --> 01:18:37,639
Keep reciting the Kalma
and don't bother about the results.

1337
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,437
But I am worried.

1338
01:18:41,234 --> 01:18:42,679
About your father.

1339
01:18:43,301 --> 01:18:45,508
You may leave.
Good bye.

1340
01:18:45,934 --> 01:18:48,278
What are you saying?
- Yes.

1341
01:18:48,334 --> 01:18:50,314
Yes, this is wrong.

1342
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,437
This is very wrong!
It's a crime.

1343
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,639
No one can be forced...

1344
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,338
...to become a Muslim!

1345
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,175
Mehmood!
- This has to be said.

1346
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:01,477
A son has every right to meet
his father.

1347
01:19:01,567 --> 01:19:03,569
Mehmood!
-And if you steal his right...

1348
01:19:03,634 --> 01:19:06,342
...then, under section 239
of the Indian Penal Code...

1349
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,175
Mehmood! Stop!
- ...and section 340...

1350
01:19:08,234 --> 01:19:10,145
...you could be dragged to court
for this.

1351
01:19:11,334 --> 01:19:13,143
Really? So you brought
your lawyer with you.

1352
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:14,572
No, we are old friends.

1353
01:19:14,634 --> 01:19:16,671
Mehmood Nazeem Ali Shah
etc, etc...

1354
01:19:16,767 --> 01:19:18,440
...whatever your name is,
you are a lawyer.

1355
01:19:18,534 --> 01:19:19,808
Yes, Sir.

1356
01:19:20,067 --> 01:19:22,069
Take him to court and let him fight
for his rights.

1357
01:19:22,167 --> 01:19:24,943
No! I... - But, by the time
the hearing comes up...

1358
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,209
...your father will
be dead and gone.

1359
01:19:30,067 --> 01:19:31,842
Sit down! Let me speak.

1360
01:19:33,167 --> 01:19:35,204
Don't listen to him.

1361
01:19:35,834 --> 01:19:38,678
Just let me meet my father...

1362
01:19:38,767 --> 01:19:40,405
...let me meet my dad.

1363
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:41,843
Good bye.

1364
01:19:51,734 --> 01:19:53,543
He won't give in easily.

1365
01:19:54,034 --> 01:19:57,481
Let's do one thing.
Sign a legal affidavit.

1366
01:19:57,567 --> 01:19:59,069
I will handle the rest of it.

1367
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:03,905
You'll see, within two days...

1368
01:20:03,967 --> 01:20:05,173
...your dad and he...

1369
01:20:05,234 --> 01:20:07,373
...will land up at your doorstep.

1370
01:20:07,467 --> 01:20:08,571
I promise you...

1371
01:20:08,634 --> 01:20:11,046
...I will change my name
if I can't. - No!

1372
01:20:11,601 --> 01:20:14,411
I have heard you say your name
a thousand times, enough!

1373
01:20:15,167 --> 01:20:18,376
I told you, I don't
want to go to court.

1374
01:20:20,234 --> 01:20:22,407
This is all your fault.

1375
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,775
Because of me?
- You bet!

1376
01:20:25,134 --> 01:20:27,774
If you weren't rude to him,
we wouldn't be in this situation.

1377
01:20:28,167 --> 01:20:30,078
Are you fighting with me over that
wretched clergyman?

1378
01:20:30,167 --> 01:20:31,737
With your friend?

1379
01:20:31,934 --> 01:20:35,780
This is too much! I have done
so much for your friendship.

1380
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,914
I taught you, out of my love
for you. I tutored you.

1381
01:20:39,967 --> 01:20:41,605
I mentored you and you?

1382
01:20:41,701 --> 01:20:44,011
An immature friend
is a pain in the neck.

1383
01:20:45,101 --> 01:20:46,808
With a friend like you...

1384
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:49,039
...who needs enemies?

1385
01:20:49,234 --> 01:20:51,077
Great!

1386
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,775
Cheat! Traitor!

1387
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:57,579
What happened?
- Get out.

1388
01:20:58,567 --> 01:20:59,910
What?

1389
01:21:01,067 --> 01:21:02,808
Out here?
- Yes, here.

1390
01:21:02,867 --> 01:21:04,346
Right here, right now.

1391
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,941
He's back on track.

1392
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,343
He betrayed me.

1393
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:15,213
And how? In the middle of the road,
outside the city limits.

1394
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,870
My grandma was right!

1395
01:21:16,934 --> 01:21:19,005
You people can't
be loyal to anyone!

1396
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:21,671
And you people can't
be grateful to anyone.

1397
01:21:21,767 --> 01:21:23,041
You people are ungrateful!

1398
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:25,944
Your clan is treacherous, it runs
in your blood.

1399
01:21:26,167 --> 01:21:29,774
All the wars in the world
boil down to you!

1400
01:21:30,034 --> 01:21:32,378
Whether it is Hindus,
Christians, or Jews.

1401
01:21:32,467 --> 01:21:33,969
It doesn't matter who the
other party is...

1402
01:21:34,034 --> 01:21:36,105
...the first party is always
your people!

1403
01:21:37,234 --> 01:21:39,111
You have no idea...

1404
01:21:39,434 --> 01:21:41,607
...what problems a minority
community faces?

1405
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:43,077
Minority.

1406
01:21:43,434 --> 01:21:46,677
When you don't get your rights,
it sets off a fire.

1407
01:21:47,267 --> 01:21:48,678
You can't get homes.

1408
01:21:48,734 --> 01:21:50,111
You can't find jobs.

1409
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,976
Every other person considers
us to be terrorists.

1410
01:21:53,067 --> 01:21:54,375
Why?

1411
01:21:54,467 --> 01:21:56,811
Didn't we...

1412
01:21:57,034 --> 01:21:59,036
...participate in building
this country...

1413
01:21:59,134 --> 01:22:01,614
...and in setting it free?

1414
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:04,204
How can we prove that
we are patriotic, too?

1415
01:22:04,267 --> 01:22:06,042
To challenge that...

1416
01:22:06,134 --> 01:22:08,637
...I came alone, to live
in your colony.

1417
01:22:08,701 --> 01:22:10,544
And if I had not been a lawyer,
I swear to God...

1418
01:22:10,634 --> 01:22:13,410
...you would have thrown me
out, with dishonor!

1419
01:22:13,867 --> 01:22:17,076
Not onto the highway, or out of
the city but, out of this country!

1420
01:22:18,467 --> 01:22:19,810
Good bye.

1421
01:22:37,867 --> 01:22:39,141
What's the matter?

1422
01:22:39,401 --> 01:22:40,539
Shraddha!

1423
01:22:42,201 --> 01:22:45,876
Amit, why do you keep calling me
to check on the lighting?

1424
01:22:46,167 --> 01:22:48,010
I really miss you.

1425
01:22:48,267 --> 01:22:50,269
It's no use, now.

1426
01:22:50,734 --> 01:22:52,179
It's too late.

1427
01:22:53,467 --> 01:22:54,775
What happened?

1428
01:22:56,267 --> 01:22:59,339
Amit, I tried to stop Dad.

1429
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,074
But, you've been dithering so much!

1430
01:23:02,134 --> 01:23:04,136
You wasted a lot of time.

1431
01:23:05,134 --> 01:23:07,512
Now, Vyas Uncle has convinced dad.

1432
01:23:09,301 --> 01:23:12,475
I am going to marry Vivek, Amit.

1433
01:23:15,334 --> 01:23:19,305
And dad is going to announce
it on the day of appearance.

1434
01:23:21,767 --> 01:23:24,179
So, forget about me.
- It's not possible!

1435
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:25,908
I will die!

1436
01:23:26,734 --> 01:23:29,476
I turned religious
for you, but, dad?

1437
01:23:30,867 --> 01:23:33,347
I don't know what he
is always up to.

1438
01:23:35,534 --> 01:23:38,174
I am going to kill myself.
- Please, Amit.

1439
01:23:38,967 --> 01:23:40,275
Shraddha!

1440
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:45,603
Only a miracle will help us to get
married, now.

1441
01:23:50,334 --> 01:23:51,506
A miracle?

1442
01:23:51,567 --> 01:23:55,014
Come close to the screen, devotees.

1443
01:23:55,067 --> 01:23:57,946
Neelanand Swami has a special
message...

1444
01:23:58,034 --> 01:24:00,412
...which is going to be telecast.
- Hail!

1445
01:24:00,467 --> 01:24:02,538
Hail Neelanand Maharaj!
- Hail!

1446
01:24:02,634 --> 01:24:04,875
Hail Neelanand Maharaj!
- Hail!

1447
01:24:05,267 --> 01:24:08,874
I am really sad...

1448
01:24:08,934 --> 01:24:12,108
...to inform you...

1449
01:24:12,367 --> 01:24:17,544
...that, yesterday in Hyderabad
outside a mosque...

1450
01:24:18,067 --> 01:24:22,277
...some Muslims beat up two of
the Neel servitors.

1451
01:24:22,667 --> 01:24:23,338
What?

1452
01:24:23,434 --> 01:24:28,076
They burnt their headgear.
- Burnt it? Oh, God!

1453
01:24:28,134 --> 01:24:33,140
I will ensure that the
culprits are punished.

1454
01:24:34,267 --> 01:24:38,215
All the devotees should...

1455
01:24:38,267 --> 01:24:44,115
...protest peacefully outside the
District Administrator's office.

1456
01:24:44,201 --> 01:24:46,442
I command you to do so!

1457
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:53,609
Today, religion is in a crisis.

1458
01:24:53,667 --> 01:24:56,443
It is calling to you.

1459
01:24:56,534 --> 01:24:59,674
If you don't protect
your religion today...

1460
01:24:59,767 --> 01:25:02,976
...then, your existence
will be destroyed.

1461
01:25:03,034 --> 01:25:07,005
Go and show them what
we are capable of.

1462
01:25:07,234 --> 01:25:10,613
Show them, what we are capable of.

1463
01:25:10,667 --> 01:25:13,944
The one who combats Neelanand...
- Will be crushed!

1464
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,641
The one who combats Neelanand...
- Will be crushed!

1465
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:25,975
Oh, God.

1466
01:25:29,234 --> 01:25:31,475
Oh, God.

1467
01:25:34,601 --> 01:25:36,274
Salam.

1468
01:25:37,467 --> 01:25:40,880
Dad! - One moment, I'm in
the washroom. I'll be there.

1469
01:25:42,267 --> 01:25:44,975
Dad, I have had enough.
- Yes, it is enough.

1470
01:25:45,034 --> 01:25:48,140
What is too much?
- Whatever is too much!

1471
01:25:48,201 --> 01:25:50,545
Stop joking! What kind of a man
are you?

1472
01:25:50,767 --> 01:25:53,077
I am wondering
about that myself.

1473
01:25:53,167 --> 01:25:54,578
You don't care about me.

1474
01:25:54,634 --> 01:25:56,079
Shraddha is getting married
the day after.

1475
01:25:56,134 --> 01:25:57,943
And you haven't done squat for me
so far.

1476
01:25:58,034 --> 01:26:00,139
Either you go to the mosque or
you dress like a Christian priest.

1477
01:26:00,201 --> 01:26:01,908
I don't know what you're up to!

1478
01:26:01,967 --> 01:26:04,811
Vyas Uncle hounded Mr. Pandya and
now...

1479
01:26:04,901 --> 01:26:07,006
...he is getting Vivek married
to Shraddha.

1480
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:08,602
And I couldn't do a thing
about it.

1481
01:26:09,034 --> 01:26:10,707
You promised me!

1482
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:14,013
I will never marry and I will never
forgive you for this.

1483
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:17,013
Hey! What are you blabbering
about?

1484
01:26:17,367 --> 01:26:20,177
Listen, you are going to marry
Shraddha, okay?

1485
01:26:20,234 --> 01:26:21,713
No one can stop you.

1486
01:26:21,767 --> 01:26:23,405
Don't cry. I'll talk to Pandya.
Come on.

1487
01:26:23,467 --> 01:26:25,413
Come on.

1488
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:28,379
Dad, this is the last chance
to impress Neeleshwarji.

1489
01:26:28,434 --> 01:26:31,074
Some Muslims beat up his disciples
in Hyderabad.

1490
01:26:31,134 --> 01:26:33,740
A lot of people will be leading
a protest march from here.

1491
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:36,474
Hail Swami Neelanand.
- Hail!

1492
01:26:36,567 --> 01:26:38,774
Hail Swami Neelanand.
- Hail!

1493
01:26:38,867 --> 01:26:40,505
This won't be tolerated.

1494
01:26:40,567 --> 01:26:42,069
Tyranny won't be tolerated.

1495
01:26:42,134 --> 01:26:43,807
We will respond...
- In kind!

1496
01:26:43,901 --> 01:26:45,972
We will respond...
- In kind!

1497
01:26:46,067 --> 01:26:48,069
Hail Swami Neelanand.
- Hail!

1498
01:26:48,134 --> 01:26:50,705
Hail Swami Neelanand.
- Hail!

1499
01:26:50,767 --> 01:26:52,542
This won't be tolerated.
- Where is Mr. Pandya?

1500
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,944
There he is. He is called
Neeleshwar, here.

1501
01:26:55,034 --> 01:26:56,877
He's Neelanand Swami's
right hand man.

1502
01:26:57,234 --> 01:26:58,838
It is good,
he's the right hand man.

1503
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:00,937
I wonder what he would have to
do as the left hand man?

1504
01:27:01,001 --> 01:27:03,481
Come on.
- Tyranny won't be tolerated.

1505
01:27:03,534 --> 01:27:05,036
This won't be tolerated.

1506
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:06,704
Tyranny won't be tolerated.

1507
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,302
This won't be tolerated.

1508
01:27:08,401 --> 01:27:09,937
Tyranny won't be tolerated.

1509
01:27:10,034 --> 01:27:14,039
The world says, blue
is the greatest color of all.

1510
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:17,274
Hail the protector of religion
Neelanand Maharaj! - Hail!

1511
01:27:17,334 --> 01:27:19,644
Hail the protector of religion
Neelanand Maharaj! - Hail!

1512
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:22,271
Hail the protector of religion
Neelanand Maharaj! - Hail!

1513
01:27:22,334 --> 01:27:25,213
Hail the protector of religion
Neelanand Maharaj! - Hail!

1514
01:27:25,267 --> 01:27:29,272
The world says, blue
is the greatest color of all.

1515
01:27:29,334 --> 01:27:30,540
The world says...

1516
01:27:37,934 --> 01:27:39,004
Dad!

1517
01:27:39,067 --> 01:27:40,478
Is he Muslim?

1518
01:27:49,201 --> 01:27:50,839
I hide this.

1519
01:27:52,134 --> 01:27:54,011
To burn it in public!

1520
01:27:54,067 --> 01:27:55,637
Got a match?
Give it to me.

1521
01:27:56,201 --> 01:27:58,613
I don't smoke.
- Get me what you have.

1522
01:28:12,901 --> 01:28:15,643
Hail Swami Neelanand.
- Hail!

1523
01:28:15,734 --> 01:28:18,044
Hail Swami Neelanand.
- Hail!

1524
01:28:18,134 --> 01:28:20,944
Hail Swami Neelanand.
- Hail!

1525
01:28:21,567 --> 01:28:23,410
Hail Dharampal!
- Hail!

1526
01:28:23,467 --> 01:28:26,038
Hail Dharampal!
- Hail!

1527
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,441
Hail Dharampal!
- Hail!

1528
01:28:29,534 --> 01:28:31,377
Hail Dharampal!
- Hail!

1529
01:28:31,434 --> 01:28:33,880
Hail Dharampal!
- Hail!

1530
01:28:48,301 --> 01:28:50,872
Didn't things get out of
hand, yesterday?

1531
01:28:53,267 --> 01:28:54,439
What could I do?

1532
01:28:55,567 --> 01:28:57,376
What do you mean by that?

1533
01:28:57,967 --> 01:28:59,913
I don't understand...

1534
01:28:59,967 --> 01:29:01,469
...why did you burn the cap?

1535
01:29:01,534 --> 01:29:04,071
I don't like burning caps!

1536
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:09,736
Tell me something.

1537
01:29:10,267 --> 01:29:12,713
Why did you have it
in the first place?

1538
01:29:14,467 --> 01:29:15,741
The same old thing.

1539
01:29:18,167 --> 01:29:20,545
Listen, let me tell you something
clearly.

1540
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,773
<i>Amifl. Amara.</i>

1541
01:29:25,367 --> 01:29:28,405
I have to tell you this, clearly.
Okay?

1542
01:29:28,734 --> 01:29:31,772
Listen, the fact is that...

1543
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:33,740
Mom, I'll get it.

1544
01:29:37,734 --> 01:29:39,714
Bless you.

1545
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:41,771
Babaji!

1546
01:29:42,634 --> 01:29:43,977
Bless you.

1547
01:29:44,067 --> 01:29:45,307
""Neelanand Baba.""

1548
01:29:45,367 --> 01:29:49,577
""Neelanand Baba.""

1549
01:29:51,667 --> 01:29:54,079
Do you know why I am here?

1550
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:55,973
For tea and snacks?

1551
01:29:57,334 --> 01:30:01,146
Great!
Fantastic.

1552
01:30:02,967 --> 01:30:05,072
I am pleased with you.

1553
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:07,710
I am here to grant you a wish.

1554
01:30:07,767 --> 01:30:10,338
Dad, it's a good chance!
Ask for Shraddha to marry.

1555
01:30:10,801 --> 01:30:13,281
Why should I ask to marry her?

1556
01:30:14,067 --> 01:30:17,913
I look down on violence.

1557
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:24,307
But! The fire of anger within you...

1558
01:30:24,367 --> 01:30:26,745
...I empathize with it.

1559
01:30:26,801 --> 01:30:29,475
And influenced by that...

1560
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:32,340
...I am here to appoint you as the
protector of the law.

1561
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:34,902
Dharam pal!

1562
01:30:36,201 --> 01:30:37,680
Dharam pal!

1563
01:30:37,734 --> 01:30:41,409
That is the one
who protects religion.

1564
01:30:43,367 --> 01:30:47,179
It is time to live up to
the true meaning of your name.

1565
01:30:49,967 --> 01:30:51,878
Maharaj, what's in a name?

1566
01:30:51,934 --> 01:30:53,345
I am a simple, ordinary Hindu.

1567
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:55,880
It's not my job
to protect religion.

1568
01:30:56,501 --> 01:31:00,108
A simple, ordinary Hindu?

1569
01:31:01,867 --> 01:31:05,110
That is what I want to tell
the entire world.

1570
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:09,214
That is why, even a simple and
ordinary Hindu like you...

1571
01:31:09,301 --> 01:31:12,942
...is also forced to be
a sacred warrior.

1572
01:31:13,667 --> 01:31:17,740
Be brave!
Be fearless.

1573
01:31:18,767 --> 01:31:23,011
What will happen to the religion
if every Hindu is scared?

1574
01:31:24,634 --> 01:31:27,114
That is why, I have come home
to talk to you.

1575
01:31:27,467 --> 01:31:30,346
Very few devotees are lucky enough
to get this chance. - Really?

1576
01:31:30,434 --> 01:31:33,643
It's time to ask for your wish.

1577
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:37,113
I know it all and I know what you
will ask for...

1578
01:31:37,267 --> 01:31:40,146
See? He knows it all! He knows
what you will ask for.

1579
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:42,302
That old know it all!

1580
01:31:42,401 --> 01:31:44,403
He must have seen your love
story on the CCTV monitors.

1581
01:31:44,467 --> 01:31:47,641
Amit. Come here.

1582
01:31:50,901 --> 01:31:53,438
You are a good boy.

1583
01:31:53,734 --> 01:31:56,476
You serve the ashram very well.

1584
01:31:57,867 --> 01:32:00,677
You serve the ashram well.

1585
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:06,206
You check the bulbs
on the dome constantly.

1586
01:32:06,867 --> 01:32:09,108
Then, you wash the stairs
of the temple.

1587
01:32:09,167 --> 01:32:11,670
What a good boy!

1588
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:17,138
Swamiji,
he just needs your blessings.

1589
01:32:18,134 --> 01:32:21,013
Of course.

1590
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:24,773
Undoubtedly.

1591
01:32:28,034 --> 01:32:29,877
Neeleshwarji.

1592
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:35,349
This boy is in love
with your daughter.

1593
01:32:35,834 --> 01:32:38,576
Prabhuji, I had no idea
about this.

1594
01:32:38,901 --> 01:32:40,881
You are great.

1595
01:32:41,201 --> 01:32:42,646
You know it all.

1596
01:32:42,701 --> 01:32:44,942
They will make a fine couple.

1597
01:32:46,234 --> 01:32:49,613
I bless this wedding.

1598
01:32:50,001 --> 01:32:53,642
Swamiji, since you have been
so kind accept another request.

1599
01:32:53,867 --> 01:32:57,076
Sing a devotional hymn and
bless them both.

1600
01:32:57,134 --> 01:32:59,341
And grace us with your
divine bliss.

1601
01:33:02,967 --> 01:33:09,213
""Praise Lord Shiva.""

(Sanskrit verses)

1610
01:34:01,467 --> 01:34:02,844
Hit them!

1611
01:34:03,134 --> 01:34:04,545
Don't move forward!

1612
01:34:04,634 --> 01:34:05,908
Get back!

1613
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,274
Get back!

1614
01:34:07,334 --> 01:34:09,280
Why are you inside like a coward?

1615
01:34:09,334 --> 01:34:10,904
Come out you coward!

1616
01:34:12,567 --> 01:34:14,740
You burnt the Muslim's cap.

1617
01:34:14,834 --> 01:34:17,838
You are charged with hurting
communal feelings.

1618
01:34:19,834 --> 01:34:22,280
Sir, this is unjust.

1619
01:34:22,601 --> 01:34:25,309
First those people hit my
disciples.

1620
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,846
He expressed his protest.

1621
01:34:27,901 --> 01:34:29,539
You can say that in court.

1622
01:34:29,634 --> 01:34:32,308
The clip on YouTube is evidence
enough, against him.

1623
01:34:33,667 --> 01:34:34,668
Listen!

1624
01:34:34,734 --> 01:34:36,475
<i>Dharampzfl haâ. haâ.!</i>

1625
01:34:36,534 --> 01:34:38,514
<i>Dharampzfl haâ. haâ.!</i>

1626
01:34:38,601 --> 01:34:40,512
Calm down. Calm down.

1627
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:41,635
Or else we will have to
resort to a lathi (baton) charge.

1628
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:43,611
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1629
01:34:44,867 --> 01:34:46,505
Be kind enough to listen to me.

1630
01:34:47,501 --> 01:34:49,879
I am really sorry...

1631
01:34:50,167 --> 01:34:52,078
...that I burned the cap.

1632
01:34:52,667 --> 01:34:54,806
I beg you to forgive me.

1633
01:34:54,867 --> 01:34:57,245
What are you saying sorry for?
First, you burnt the cap!

1634
01:34:57,334 --> 01:35:00,577
You insulted us! Now he has been
caught and he is saying sorry.

1635
01:35:01,034 --> 01:35:04,607
Believe me, I am a Muslim, too.

1636
01:35:07,367 --> 01:35:08,869
I am one of you.

1637
01:35:08,967 --> 01:35:11,777
I have kept the burnt cap.
Look at this.

1638
01:35:17,334 --> 01:35:19,678
If you wish, I could recite
the Kalma.

1639
01:35:19,767 --> 01:35:21,804
And I have an adoption
certificate...

1640
01:35:21,867 --> 01:35:25,178
...which says that Meer Shauqat Ali
was my dad.

1641
01:35:26,767 --> 01:35:28,940
Please, forgive me.

1642
01:35:33,067 --> 01:35:35,638
You can't marry Shraddha.

1643
01:35:36,367 --> 01:35:38,540
You are a Muslim's son.

1644
01:35:38,934 --> 01:35:40,470
Guruji! Swamiji!

1645
01:35:40,567 --> 01:35:42,410
An FIR has been filed against
this man.

1646
01:35:42,467 --> 01:35:44,003
Go home, all of you.

1647
01:35:44,067 --> 01:35:45,705
Let the police do their jobs.

1648
01:35:45,801 --> 01:35:48,543
Sir, arrest him
and don't spare him.

1649
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:50,102
Let him go!

1650
01:35:50,201 --> 01:35:52,340
He is one of us!
Come on.

1651
01:35:52,401 --> 01:35:54,005
Everyone, go home.

1652
01:35:54,067 --> 01:35:55,603
Let's go home.

1653
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:57,340
Let them do their work.

1654
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:58,538
Come on, get out of here.

1655
01:36:07,167 --> 01:36:08,544
My son.

1656
01:36:08,801 --> 01:36:10,974
Did you have to do this charade?
- It isn't a charade, son.

1657
01:36:11,034 --> 01:36:14,743
I wanted to meet my lost father
and so...

1658
01:36:14,801 --> 01:36:17,577
I lost my dad in the bargain.

1659
01:36:17,667 --> 01:36:20,580
But I am not lost!
lam here, in front of you.

1660
01:36:20,634 --> 01:36:23,979
I am leaving. Goodbye.
- You're leaving?

1661
01:36:24,634 --> 01:36:26,580
Why is he talking so strangely?

1662
01:36:26,667 --> 01:36:28,112
He is talking strangely alright.

1663
01:36:28,167 --> 01:36:29,305
At least, he's not lying.

1664
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:31,938
Dad! - Listen to me.
I was really going to tell you.

1665
01:36:32,034 --> 01:36:33,877
It just because you got caught.

1666
01:36:33,934 --> 01:36:35,709
You are such a liar!

1667
01:36:35,767 --> 01:36:37,474
I am leaving to go to my
brother's house.

1668
01:36:39,467 --> 01:36:40,775
Listen to me.

1669
01:37:05,801 --> 01:37:07,678
Dharam!
There is a problem.

1670
01:37:07,767 --> 01:37:10,304
What is it?
- Rawal canceled the order.

1671
01:37:10,534 --> 01:37:12,571
He did?
- And Mehta? Mr. Mehta?

1672
01:37:12,667 --> 01:37:14,112
What?
- He rejected it!

1673
01:37:18,334 --> 01:37:21,042
Everyone changed within a day!

1674
01:37:22,267 --> 01:37:24,804
What did they say? The event can't
be planned without our food.

1675
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:26,641
See?
- Just forget it.

1676
01:37:26,701 --> 01:37:29,272
Alright, distribute the
food amongst the poor. - Alright.

1677
01:37:29,467 --> 01:37:30,844
Dharam.
- Yes.

1678
01:37:32,901 --> 01:37:36,041
Listen,
brother, take some time off.

1679
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:38,612
No, I will handle this.

1680
01:37:38,667 --> 01:37:40,078
Don't worry at all.

1681
01:37:41,601 --> 01:37:42,875
Do you understand?

1682
01:37:42,934 --> 01:37:44,811
For the business, you know...
- Yes.

1683
01:37:45,334 --> 01:37:47,075
I will take time off.

1684
01:37:47,434 --> 01:37:49,846
But how can I escape from myself?

1685
01:38:15,467 --> 01:38:18,539
Under Section IPC 146, 296, 298...

1686
01:38:19,534 --> 01:38:21,309
Are you being charged with this, at
your age?

1687
01:38:21,967 --> 01:38:23,674
Do you have a defense lawyer?

1688
01:38:25,434 --> 01:38:26,640
Your Honor.

1689
01:38:27,867 --> 01:38:29,312
I am the defense lawyer.

1690
01:38:29,401 --> 01:38:30,812
Who is he?
- Oh?

1691
01:38:30,867 --> 01:38:33,871
Nawab Mehmood Nazeem
Ali Shah Khan Bahadur.

1692
01:38:34,101 --> 01:38:36,274
So, how many lawyers does he have?

1693
01:38:36,534 --> 01:38:37,911
Where are the others?

1694
01:38:38,401 --> 01:38:41,007
No, Your Honor, itsjust me.

1695
01:38:41,467 --> 01:38:43,037
That is my name.

1696
01:38:43,467 --> 01:38:44,946
It may be a long name.

1697
01:38:45,034 --> 01:38:47,640
You need a couple of hearings
just to say my name.

1698
01:38:48,567 --> 01:38:49,841
Silence.

1699
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:51,908
Please, proceed.

1700
01:38:51,967 --> 01:38:53,344
Thank you very much, Sir.

1701
01:39:23,434 --> 01:39:24,674
Sir.

1702
01:39:27,034 --> 01:39:28,342
Sir.

1703
01:39:28,667 --> 01:39:30,544
This man used to pretend
to pray...

1704
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:32,637
...and try to trespass.

1705
01:39:33,434 --> 01:39:35,505
This infidel's
intentions are suspect.

1706
01:39:35,601 --> 01:39:39,344
I object to this baseless
accusation against my client.

1707
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:42,840
Sir, how can you accuse him?

1708
01:39:43,267 --> 01:39:47,443
Sir, by burning the cap,
he has proved...

1709
01:39:47,501 --> 01:39:51,039
...that he just wanted
to spread terror.

1710
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:54,946
And you intended to
convert him, that is all.

1711
01:39:55,567 --> 01:39:58,878
Oh, God! May Lord have mercy!
What are you saying?

1712
01:39:58,967 --> 01:40:00,776
Sir...
- Why would I do that?

1713
01:40:00,834 --> 01:40:03,474
Sir, the event you are
referring to...

1714
01:40:03,567 --> 01:40:06,878
...was that the first
time you met my client?

1715
01:40:08,267 --> 01:40:09,575
No.

1716
01:40:09,634 --> 01:40:13,548
When Dharampal first came to meet
his father...

1717
01:40:13,601 --> 01:40:16,207
...then you stopped him.
Why?

1718
01:40:17,234 --> 01:40:19,407
No, I didn't stop him I just...

1719
01:40:19,467 --> 01:40:23,540
Because, you said, learn
the Muslim customs, right?

1720
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:27,309
Sir, that was because...

1721
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:28,879
Wait a moment.

1722
01:40:28,967 --> 01:40:31,470
We have your
receptionist's statement.

1723
01:40:31,568 --> 01:40:33,047
Don't lie to me.

1724
01:40:33,134 --> 01:40:34,738
No, I am sure you
have the statement.

1725
01:40:34,801 --> 01:40:37,077
But, I never lie.

1726
01:40:37,367 --> 01:40:38,641
Sir.

1727
01:40:38,734 --> 01:40:41,180
In the interests of
humanity I thought...

1728
01:40:41,234 --> 01:40:43,145
...that his father is not well.

1729
01:40:43,234 --> 01:40:45,771
I thought,
if his father finds out...

1730
01:40:45,834 --> 01:40:48,337
...that his son is not
a Muslim, then...

1731
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,573
Didn't his father know...

1732
01:40:50,634 --> 01:40:52,272
...that he was adopted?

1733
01:40:53,934 --> 01:40:55,208
Yes, he knew.

1734
01:40:55,701 --> 01:40:58,477
So his father would understand
that...

1735
01:40:58,567 --> 01:41:01,070
...an adoptive parent
may be a non Muslim, too.

1736
01:41:02,167 --> 01:41:03,475
Yes, of course.

1737
01:41:03,767 --> 01:41:06,407
You Honor, his father...

1738
01:41:06,501 --> 01:41:09,573
...didn't marry again due to his
sorrow over his son.

1739
01:41:11,067 --> 01:41:13,980
He would have been happy to meet
his son.

1740
01:41:15,533 --> 01:41:19,037
But, the clergyman
only wanted to...

1741
01:41:19,100 --> 01:41:21,410
mconven my client.

1742
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:23,810
No!
- Sir, because of you...

1743
01:41:23,867 --> 01:41:27,212
...my client has lost
his mental balance.

1744
01:41:27,434 --> 01:41:29,607
You played with his emotions.

1745
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:31,270
And for that, I...

1746
01:41:31,334 --> 01:41:35,840
...l, will file
a lawsuit against you!

1747
01:41:35,901 --> 01:41:39,041
Under section 339 and 340...
- But...

1748
01:41:39,134 --> 01:41:40,738
...what are you saying?

1749
01:41:41,067 --> 01:41:42,774
No, please think it over calmly.

1750
01:41:42,867 --> 01:41:45,177
You don't have to do this.
- Sir.

1751
01:41:45,701 --> 01:41:47,510
Is his dad in a place...

1752
01:41:47,801 --> 01:41:49,747
...where non-Muslims can't enter?

1753
01:41:50,401 --> 01:41:53,405
No, Sir. It is not like that.

1754
01:41:54,234 --> 01:41:55,736
I was just being human...

1755
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:58,739
God have mercy!
Sir...

1756
01:41:58,834 --> 01:42:00,939
Sir. - Yes.
- You may leave.

1757
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:03,074
Yes, Sir.

1758
01:42:05,067 --> 01:42:07,047
Your Honor, this is the truth.

1759
01:42:07,901 --> 01:42:12,748
My client was forced by
circumstances to burn that cap.

1760
01:42:13,401 --> 01:42:15,278
He has said sorry for that.

1761
01:42:16,067 --> 01:42:19,879
Actually, the clergyman
is responsible for this.

1762
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:24,515
If he had let a
son meet his father...

1763
01:42:24,734 --> 01:42:26,372
...this would never have
happened.

1764
01:42:26,434 --> 01:42:28,539
The cap would not be burnt.

1765
01:42:28,834 --> 01:42:31,246
I met Dharampal's dad yesterday.

1766
01:42:31,301 --> 01:42:33,406
He is very ill.

1767
01:42:33,934 --> 01:42:38,440
Your Honor, whatever your verdict
may be...

1768
01:42:39,234 --> 01:42:42,443
...but, there is a higher court
than this one.

1769
01:42:42,834 --> 01:42:44,404
God's court of justice.

1770
01:42:45,167 --> 01:42:48,478
And in that court, my client...

1771
01:42:48,934 --> 01:42:50,277
...is innocent.

1772
01:42:51,567 --> 01:42:52,807
That's all, Your Honor.

1773
01:43:03,667 --> 01:43:07,376
This court hereby finds Dharampal
Rammohan Trivedi...

1774
01:43:08,167 --> 01:43:09,737
...not innocent.

1775
01:43:10,667 --> 01:43:13,147
But, he is not as great a
criminal as he is being shown as.

1776
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:16,246
He made a mistake given
the circumstances.

1777
01:43:16,734 --> 01:43:18,372
That is why, this court...

1778
01:43:18,767 --> 01:43:21,179
...orders him to offer
a hundred of these caps...

1779
01:43:21,234 --> 01:43:23,680
...to needy Muslims as a fine.

1780
01:43:25,334 --> 01:43:27,507
The clergyman is hereby ordered...

1781
01:43:27,567 --> 01:43:30,639
...to allow Dharampal to meet
his father at once.

1782
01:44:22,634 --> 01:44:26,104
He waited for his son,
till the end.

1783
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:28,871
Thank God the lawyer
gave his picture.

1784
01:44:29,834 --> 01:44:32,314
At least, he saw the face
of his son.

1785
01:44:34,768 --> 01:44:37,476
Lift up the chin.
Smile. Pleasant.

1786
01:45:18,267 --> 01:45:23,580
""Who created me?""

1787
01:45:26,534 --> 01:45:31,711
""My shadow questions me.""

1788
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:40,111
""Caught in questions of
my own existence.""

1789
01:45:40,334 --> 01:45:47,479
""My soul is in agony.
Let me see you.""

1790
01:45:47,767 --> 01:45:54,207
""Heal my sorrow, oh Lord.""

1791
01:45:54,767 --> 01:45:56,747
""Oh Lord.""

1792
01:45:57,401 --> 01:46:04,615
""Oh Lord. Tell me, who I am.""

1793
01:46:04,667 --> 01:46:11,414
""You are God and the
Almighty, oh Lord.""

1794
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:34,207
""I am steeped in my sorrow.""

1795
01:46:36,067 --> 01:46:42,143
""I don't lose, nor do I win.""

1796
01:46:43,467 --> 01:46:49,042
""My feet walk on shards
of glass.""

1797
01:46:50,834 --> 01:46:56,580
""The tears fall, as I laugh.""

1798
01:46:57,667 --> 01:47:01,080
""This traveler is lost.""

1799
01:47:01,334 --> 01:47:04,872
""He doesn't know
the way back home.""

1800
01:47:05,067 --> 01:47:11,575
""My soul is in agony.
Let me see you.""

1801
01:47:12,367 --> 01:47:19,342
""Heal my sorrow, oh Lord.""

1802
01:47:19,401 --> 01:47:21,904
""Oh Lord.""

1803
01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:25,707
""Oh Lord.""

1804
01:47:25,767 --> 01:47:29,408
""Tell me, who I am.""

1805
01:47:29,501 --> 01:47:37,352
""You are God and the
Almighty, oh Lord.""

1806
01:47:42,967 --> 01:47:45,379
What did I gain by walking
on the path of religion?

1807
01:47:46,601 --> 01:47:48,877
My wife and kids went away.

1808
01:47:49,067 --> 01:47:50,808
My father went away, too.

1809
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:54,711
What did I gain?
Liquor?

1810
01:47:58,267 --> 01:48:01,510
I am going to destroy Neelanand.

1811
01:48:01,667 --> 01:48:05,012
Did you notice the emphasis
I put on the word, destroy?

1812
01:48:05,334 --> 01:48:07,905
I will destroy him with emphasis.

1813
01:48:09,134 --> 01:48:10,408
Destroy!

1814
01:48:11,801 --> 01:48:14,008
Stop the car to one side.

1815
01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:36,473
Amazing! He's winking here, too!
Rascal!

1816
01:48:50,534 --> 01:48:56,416
(Sanskrit verses)

1817
01:48:57,834 --> 01:49:01,611
(Sanskrit verses)

1818
01:49:01,667 --> 01:49:05,444
(Sanskrit verses)

1819
01:49:05,534 --> 01:49:09,175
(Sanskrit verses)

1820
01:49:09,267 --> 01:49:14,410
(Sanskrit verses)

1821
01:49:36,334 --> 01:49:37,677
Hello?

1822
01:49:39,034 --> 01:49:40,342
Yes?

1823
01:49:41,467 --> 01:49:43,071
Mom, it's dad, again.

1824
01:49:44,134 --> 01:49:45,442
Hello?

1825
01:49:50,267 --> 01:49:51,507
What is it, now?

1826
01:49:51,601 --> 01:49:52,739
He said, he is going
to the ashram.

1827
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,404
He will talk to Swamiji face
to face.

1828
01:49:54,500 --> 01:49:56,446
The day of appearance is a huge
celebration.

1829
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:58,810
We have to stop him!
This man is crazy.

1830
01:50:03,701 --> 01:50:08,013
Neelanand Baba.

1831
01:50:10,167 --> 01:50:14,513
Neelanand Baba.

1832
01:50:16,434 --> 01:50:20,405
Neelanand Baba.

1833
01:50:24,267 --> 01:50:26,372
Eternal joy!

1834
01:50:28,067 --> 01:50:30,104
The joy of yoga!

1835
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:33,607
The bliss of the honest soul!

1836
01:50:33,667 --> 01:50:37,774
""Neelanand Baba.""

1837
01:50:37,834 --> 01:50:41,748
""Neelanand Baba.""

1838
01:50:41,834 --> 01:50:46,783
""Those who come to you...""

1839
01:50:50,134 --> 01:50:54,173
""Those who come to you...

1840
01:50:54,267 --> 01:50:58,579
...you shower him with happiness.""

1841
01:50:58,634 --> 01:51:00,545
Watch slime bloom in the lotus!

1842
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:02,546
""Those who come to you...

1843
01:51:02,634 --> 01:51:07,083
...you shower him with happiness.""

1844
01:51:07,134 --> 01:51:10,843
""Neelanand Baba.""

1845
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:15,280
This is a rare
honor for all of you.

1846
01:51:15,334 --> 01:51:18,872
As always, even this year...

1847
01:51:19,167 --> 01:51:22,307
...Swamiji will greet
his news devotees.

1848
01:51:25,467 --> 01:51:26,912
Greetings, Maharaj.

1849
01:51:27,201 --> 01:51:30,944
Welcome to our family.

1850
01:51:33,834 --> 01:51:36,508
Hello, check.
One, two, three.

1851
01:51:36,601 --> 01:51:38,342
We would like to know...

1852
01:51:38,534 --> 01:51:43,847
...do you have a trial membership
package at the ashram?

1853
01:51:44,934 --> 01:51:48,279
After that we will
consider joining.

1854
01:51:48,334 --> 01:51:49,813
Do you get my drift?

1855
01:51:49,867 --> 01:51:51,938
Hello, can you hear me?

1856
01:51:52,034 --> 01:51:55,277
This is a religious family.
We don't do all that.

1857
01:51:58,100 --> 01:51:59,408
Swamiji.
- Yes.

1858
01:51:59,667 --> 01:52:01,544
My friend is a Hindu.

1859
01:52:01,634 --> 01:52:05,138
His daughter is in love
with a Muslim boy.

1860
01:52:05,234 --> 01:52:08,010
Is that allowed by your
religion?

1861
01:52:08,934 --> 01:52:11,414
If the boy is willing to
give up his religion...

1862
01:52:11,467 --> 01:52:13,140
...and accept Swamiji's
allegiance...

1863
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:16,010
...then, Swamiji will be pleased
to bless him.

1864
01:52:16,367 --> 01:52:20,611
But, what is the issue if the boy
and girl don't convert?

1865
01:52:23,167 --> 01:52:26,046
We can never accept
such a marriage.

1866
01:52:26,300 --> 01:52:29,679
But, why?
- I will answer that.

1867
01:52:31,301 --> 01:52:35,613
Lord Krishna has
said in the Gita...

1868
01:52:36,267 --> 01:52:38,611
...in paragraph seven, verse 15.

1869
01:52:39,134 --> 01:52:44,174
(Sanskrit verses)

1870
01:52:44,234 --> 01:52:49,206
(Sanskrit verses)

1871
01:52:49,268 --> 01:52:53,580
That means, the man who
is a non believer...

1872
01:52:54,067 --> 01:52:58,447
...who believes in any power
other than God...

1873
01:52:58,501 --> 01:53:01,846
...he can't come back to God.

1874
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:05,274
Maharaj, it can also mean that...

1875
01:53:05,334 --> 01:53:08,508
...those who are trapped by
the illusory web of creation...

1876
01:53:08,567 --> 01:53:10,547
...those who are influenced by
material happiness...

1877
01:53:10,601 --> 01:53:13,013
...can't come to me for succor.
However...

1878
01:53:13,067 --> 01:53:16,276
...God has also provided another
path for their redemption.

1879
01:53:16,734 --> 01:53:18,907
He provides a service
entrance for them.

1880
01:53:18,967 --> 01:53:23,006
He mentions in 18th
para of the Gita verse 66...

1881
01:53:23,367 --> 01:53:27,110
(Sanskrit verses)

1882
01:53:27,668 --> 01:53:31,548
(Sanskrit verses)

1883
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:35,309
That means, forget every1hing
and turn to me.

1884
01:53:35,367 --> 01:53:38,211
I will absolve you of your sins
and accept you.

1885
01:53:39,167 --> 01:53:41,545
The same goes for
the holy Quran, too.

1886
01:53:41,967 --> 01:53:43,537
It is mentioned
in the Sura-e-Yunus.

1887
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:45,204
All of them mention it.

1888
01:53:45,300 --> 01:53:47,906
Anyone can accept Islam.

1889
01:53:58,867 --> 01:54:00,744
Who is this imposter?
- Who is he?

1890
01:54:02,367 --> 01:54:05,644
The same guy who burnt the cap.
That youtube guy.

1891
01:54:05,700 --> 01:54:07,771
Whether you pray,
perform a veneration...

1892
01:54:07,867 --> 01:54:10,677
...light candles, incense, or lamps.
- What is he saying?

1893
01:54:10,734 --> 01:54:12,475
Chant the beads
or the Tibetan wheel.

1894
01:54:12,534 --> 01:54:14,241
It all goes to
the same holy spirit.

1895
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:16,780
Then, why does someone who
prays differently...

1896
01:54:16,867 --> 01:54:19,279
...get called infidiel?
Answer me.

1897
01:54:20,267 --> 01:54:22,975
This man is a liar.

1898
01:54:23,467 --> 01:54:24,912
Did you see that?

1899
01:54:25,534 --> 01:54:27,946
He is dressed as an ascetic.

1900
01:54:28,700 --> 01:54:32,170
Now, he is talking nonsense
and mocking us.

1901
01:54:33,167 --> 01:54:37,877
The truth is he was born in a
Muslim family.

1902
01:54:38,267 --> 01:54:41,510
A Muslim!
- Security! Throw him out.

1903
01:54:41,567 --> 01:54:44,707
Speak up, Dharampal,
is that a lie?

1904
01:54:44,767 --> 01:54:48,180
I admit, I was born
to a Muslim mother.

1905
01:54:48,267 --> 01:54:50,907
But a Hindu mom raised me.

1906
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,708
How will you decide which
religion I belong to?

1907
01:54:53,767 --> 01:54:55,974
He seems drunk, who is he?

1908
01:54:56,034 --> 01:54:57,377
How dare he come here?

1909
01:54:57,434 --> 01:55:00,244
What do you wish to say?
Tell me, Dharampal!

1910
01:55:01,434 --> 01:55:03,914
Why didn't you let my
son get married?

1911
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:06,009
Because, my parents are Muslim.

1912
01:55:06,067 --> 01:55:09,207
Since that is the case,
do I lose all sense of myself?

1913
01:55:09,434 --> 01:55:12,278
I am someone's dad, a son,
a husband.

1914
01:55:12,367 --> 01:55:14,244
Does none of it matter?

1915
01:55:14,301 --> 01:55:16,178
Does only my religion matter?

1916
01:55:16,867 --> 01:55:19,575
Religion is meant to unite
and divide, not estrange.

1917
01:55:19,834 --> 01:55:21,905
But Priests of all religions
do that.

1918
01:55:22,001 --> 01:55:23,207
Listen, you rogue!

1919
01:55:23,301 --> 01:55:25,872
Don't say another word.
- What is he saying?

1920
01:55:25,967 --> 01:55:29,005
I am not here to create a scene.

1921
01:55:29,534 --> 01:55:31,912
I am here for my son.

1922
01:55:32,668 --> 01:55:35,842
But, I don't care who you pray to.

1923
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:38,873
Just answer one question.

1924
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:44,240
If the Neel Parivar doesn't accept
someone born out of its religion...

1925
01:55:44,467 --> 01:55:46,174
...then, your Swamiji...

1926
01:55:46,234 --> 01:55:49,238
...who is born into a Sikh family...

1927
01:55:49,301 --> 01:55:51,440
...how can he lead your family?

1928
01:55:51,701 --> 01:55:53,146
He is calling Swamiji a Sikh!

1929
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:55,976
Call for security
or we will kill him.

1930
01:55:56,034 --> 01:55:59,106
Yes, Neelanand Swami...

1931
01:55:59,167 --> 01:56:03,616
...is the former Bhangra pop
singer Manjeet Manchala.

1932
01:56:03,900 --> 01:56:06,278
How can this performer
be your leader?

1933
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:07,174
What?

1934
01:56:07,267 --> 01:56:10,146
""Wear a fancy turban.""

1935
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:12,905
""Dance to the beat of the drum.""

1936
01:56:12,967 --> 01:56:16,608
(Sanskrit verses)

1937
01:56:16,700 --> 01:56:19,544
(Sanskrit verses)

1938
01:56:19,601 --> 01:56:22,980
Manjeet Manchala and Swamiji
are the same man.

1939
01:56:23,034 --> 01:56:24,377
Their voices are the same.

1940
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:26,643
Test this, and you
will know the truth.

1941
01:56:26,734 --> 01:56:28,907
""Why do you stare at me
when you dance?""

1942
01:56:28,967 --> 01:56:30,708
(Sanskrit verses)

1943
01:56:30,767 --> 01:56:33,611
(Sanskrit verses)

1944
01:56:33,667 --> 01:56:36,147
And another thing, the eyes.

1945
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:39,870
Manchala and Neelanand have
the same eyes.

1946
01:56:40,367 --> 01:56:43,974
Their eyes twitch
when they are nervous. Watch this.

1947
01:56:44,167 --> 01:56:46,511
Look at Manchala's nervous twitch.

1948
01:56:46,567 --> 01:56:49,810
This is called blapharospasm.

1949
01:56:49,901 --> 01:56:51,847
It is a very rare disease.

1950
01:56:53,701 --> 01:56:55,942
He cut his hair and shaved
his beard off.

1951
01:56:56,034 --> 01:56:58,844
He could fool all of you.

1952
01:56:58,900 --> 01:57:01,141
But, what can he do about his voice?
- What is this?

1953
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:03,077
He's a fake?
- What will you do about the eye?

1954
01:57:03,134 --> 01:57:05,876
This is impossible,
he can't do this.

1955
01:57:05,934 --> 01:57:09,746
His list of exploits
is really long.

1956
01:57:09,901 --> 01:57:12,347
The Havala scam, trafficking.

1957
01:57:13,067 --> 01:57:14,978
Abusing innocent girls.

1958
01:57:15,068 --> 01:57:17,048
He has done it all.

1959
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:20,046
He pulled off a black money scam?

1960
01:57:20,101 --> 01:57:21,671
It is true.

1961
01:57:22,434 --> 01:57:24,539
He has made so many girls
fall pregnant!

1962
01:57:24,634 --> 01:57:26,580
That is a lot of evidence.

1963
01:57:31,167 --> 01:57:32,942
This is Manjeet Manchala.

1964
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:38,946
Ever since he was set free
on bail he has been missing.

1965
01:57:39,034 --> 01:57:42,243
Suddenly, he emerged a
few years ago from Ahmedabad.

1966
01:57:42,301 --> 01:57:43,905
As Swami Neelanand.

1967
01:57:43,967 --> 01:57:45,378
Is this a lie?

1968
01:58:00,167 --> 01:58:02,044
Swamiji, come on, hurry.
- Come fast.

1969
01:58:02,134 --> 01:58:03,841
He has run away!

1970
01:58:05,034 --> 01:58:06,570
He has fooled us!

1971
01:58:14,134 --> 01:58:16,444
Neeleshwar?
- It's not Neeleshwar.

1972
01:58:16,901 --> 01:58:18,812
<i>Badrinath Pandya.</i>

1973
01:58:21,834 --> 01:58:23,074
Listen.

1974
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:26,381
Listen to me. I am not here
to provoke anyone.

1975
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:28,711
I won't prove that...

1976
01:58:28,801 --> 01:58:31,645
...he is not Hindu and I am
not a Muslim.

1977
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:37,008
I am here, to take my family home.

1978
01:58:37,667 --> 01:58:38,975
That is it.

1979
01:58:41,634 --> 01:58:44,638
My family's peace is my religion.

1980
01:58:45,334 --> 01:58:48,372
I don't care about
the Hindu Muslim labels.

1981
01:58:50,567 --> 01:58:52,877
I read the Quran for my dad.

1982
01:58:53,467 --> 01:58:55,208
He left the world.

1983
01:58:55,534 --> 01:58:57,445
I took up the Gita for my son.

1984
01:58:58,034 --> 01:58:59,707
He left the house.

1985
01:59:03,001 --> 01:59:05,811
I was left alone
with only books in my hands.

1986
01:59:08,867 --> 01:59:11,575
Why are we fighting over labels
about religion?

1987
01:59:11,934 --> 01:59:14,005
This poison is within our DNA.

1988
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:18,707
When I read the Gita
and the Quran a bit, I realized...

1989
01:59:18,767 --> 01:59:23,307
...that, Ram and Rahim, Mohammad
and Mahadev are one.

1990
01:59:23,467 --> 01:59:25,538
They say the same things.

1991
01:59:25,601 --> 01:59:27,239
Do good, be good.

1992
01:59:27,334 --> 01:59:29,007
Wear a cap or apply the tilak.

1993
01:59:29,468 --> 01:59:30,606
Do good.

1994
01:59:30,667 --> 01:59:32,943
There is only one true religion.

1995
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,308
Humanity.

1996
01:59:34,934 --> 01:59:36,072
Humanity.

1997
01:59:43,334 --> 01:59:44,779
Missed you Dad.

1998
01:59:45,268 --> 01:59:46,576
Dharam.

1999
01:59:50,734 --> 01:59:52,145

2000
02:00:11,534 --> 02:00:14,242
Abdul, make sure it is tasty.

2001
02:00:14,334 --> 02:00:15,642
We have very important guests.

2002
02:00:15,734 --> 02:00:17,179
Our image is at stake.

2003
02:00:17,234 --> 02:00:18,304
One moment.

2004
02:00:18,367 --> 02:00:19,846
Tell me.
I will be back.

2005
02:00:19,934 --> 02:00:21,242
Don't worry.

It is going to be fun!
Don't worry.

2007
02:00:23,567 --> 02:00:24,705
It will be done.

2008
02:00:26,300 --> 02:00:30,510
""Carefree and willful.""

2009
02:00:30,567 --> 02:00:32,945
Come in.

Be happy, be successful.

No matter where you may live.

2012

What is this?

2013
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:43,913

02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:46,009
Yes. Go for it.

2015
02:00:47,767 --> 02:00:50,907
""Wear a fancy turban..""

2016
02:00:51,301 --> 02:00:52,541
""With the drum beat playing.""

2017
02:00:52,601 --> 02:00:54,137
What is wrong with you?

2018
02:00:54,234 --> 02:00:55,577
Dad?
- Yes.

2019
02:00:55,668 --> 02:00:57,477
Dad, this is my friend Peter.

2020
02:00:57,801 --> 02:00:59,644
Hello!

2021
02:00:59,767 --> 02:01:04,978

Anwar, kill it when you see it.

Why did you steal?

27
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,240
My siblings were hungry.
So I had to steal.

28
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,960
If they were hungry
you could ask food.

29
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,120
What will they learn from you?

30
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
I vow on them. I won't do it again.

31
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,760

Go.
- Uncle, wait.

33
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,440
If we leave them now they may
take a wrong step in life.

34
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,320
We need to take their
responsibility.

35
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,600
We? You will go to the college
leaving them to me.

36

Sir, please keep them here. Please!

37

These children need
a mentor like you.

Where will I keep them?
What will they do here?

39
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,880
We needed an extra helper right?

40
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,960
Uncle Anwar will teach him the job.

41
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,880
He won't need to steal then.

42
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,640
Look... Sir.! - Don't pressurize
me. I refuse to hire him.

43
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,640

00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,880
Thank you sir. I'm leaving. Bye.

59
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Bye-bye.

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,080
Stupid guy.

61
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,320
How are you?
- I'm good. What's up?

62
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,880
Sahil! Sahil, wait.

63
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
Venu!

64
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,880
Where were you?
I thought you didn't come.

65
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,240
I was sleeping in Aman's room.

66
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,800
Dude who comes so early
in the morning?

67
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,280
Why did you wear the muffler?
- I will do it.

68
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,600
Just like that. I am feeling cold.
- Look.

69
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,440
Jehan!

70
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,920
Fool!

71
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,600
He is troubling me since morning.
Idiot. - Let's go.

72
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Forget it.

73
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,240
Hey! What happened on your cheeks?

74
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,080
I got a cut while shaving.
Forget it.

75
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,360
Is it a deep wound?

76
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,480
No.

77
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,400
It must be Mr. Javed's lecture.
Let's go. - Let's go.

78
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,520
Really? Mr. Javed.

79
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,680
Good morning sir.
- Good morning.

80
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,920
Settle down.
- Thank you sir. - Thank you sir!

81
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,720
So guys how was your vacation?

82
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,880
Amazing sir.
- Good. - Great.

83
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,080
This semester we will
be starting...

84
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,120
Yes.

85
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,680
Hello Sir! I am Mittee.

86
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,960
Oh yes.
Mr. Das informed me about you.

87
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,040
You are late.
- Sorry sir!

88
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,160
Come.

89
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,240
So this semester we will start
with a very interesting topic.

90
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,960
If all is done in the process...

91
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,520
Come on, sit there.

92
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,120
Yes sir.

93
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,160
Hi! Venugopal.

94
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,760
Hi!
- Hi!

95
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,840
Hi!
- Hi!

96
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,880
And that one.

97
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,000
Look at you it's not even 24
hours that you've seen her.

98
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,480
I found her sweet.

99
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,000
How come she's sweet without
knowing her? Idiot.

100
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,680
Come on.
- What?

101
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,440
She is coming here.
- Let's join them. - Sure.

102
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Where were you before this?
- Delhi.

103
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,880
Oh, I am also from Delhi. Noida.

104
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,640
Which sector?
- 16. - Nice! - Fool!

105
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,040
Hey! - Gyan, that's enough.
- What are you doing?

106
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,800
Look,
the body guard is getting angry.

107
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,080
Sit down. Forget it. - Sit down.
They keep troubling all the time.

108
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,680
Forget it. You know how he is.

109
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,240
These two often fight.

110
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,760
Hey! A tattoo?

111
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,600
You said it's a cut. Show it to me.

112
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,320
Anuisvenu?

113
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,360
Anu is Venu.
There's an apostrophe after Anu.

114
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,960
Who is Anu?

115
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,960
She's my wife.

116
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,280
Wife? Did you marry during
the vacation? - Hush!

117
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,960
In my family everyone gets
married at the age of 21.

118
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,240
They got me married too.

119
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,760
Do you know the meaning of Anus?

120
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,760
I know it.
The place you leave faeces.

121
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,200
I realised after I made the tattoo
that is looks anus and not Anu.

122
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,200
What will you do with it? - I will
bandage it. - The whole year?

123
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,000
Yes.
Jehan and Om shouldn't notice it.

124
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,800
Hey! Vow on me.
Don't tell anyone. It's our secret.

125
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,360
Okay Anus.
- Stupid.

126
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,800
Hey!

127
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,520
What were you watching?
- Nothing.

128
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,520
Desibhai.com.

129
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Anything.

130
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,480
If you are not watching then show
it to me. Why are you hiding it?

131
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,240
Oh, the Delhi girl.

132
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,200
I will tell Mittee.

133
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,440
Sahil Mehra is feeling something.

134
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,840
She's cute. Your choice is not bad.

135
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,560
What did you do?

136
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,960
If you tell anyone I'll make your
tattoo picture viral. I...

137
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,760
Delete it.
- Why?

138
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,520
Do you feel I'll tell anyone?

139
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,400
Don't think about it.
- You are serious.

140
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,160
Obviously!

141
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,800
It's her birthday tomorrow. Look.
- Birthday?

142
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,400
7th June. It's written here. Look!

143
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,200
Enjoy your drink.
- Yeah. Thank you.

144
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,960
Here.

145
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,200
It's fine. Mittee didn't invite
us for her birthday. So what?

146
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,200
We are having our party.
Take it. Come on.

147
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,560
Cheers!

148
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,360
Look, the girl with golden hair.
She is staring at me.

149
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,920
Drink it.
I'll be right back. Excuse me.

150
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,520
Venu, you are married.

151
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,560
I am going to dance. Let me dance.

152
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,120
If you do anything else.
I will pull off this bandage.

153
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,720
I got it.
- What?

154
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
Thank you.

155
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,120
Come along.

156
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,240
Oh my god!

157
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,000
Mittee, come quickly.

158
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,600
Hey!
- Hi!

159
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,680
Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

160
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,520
Two large avelox on the rocks.

161
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,120
What should I get for you?
Milk or sweet butter milk.

162
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,640
Mittee! Cheers!

163
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,560
Drink it.

164
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,080
Oh, this is my favourite song.
Come let's dance.

165
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Why not? Let's go.

166
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,040
Jehan! I'll join you in some time.

167
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,240
Why later? Come on.
- Please!

168
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,160
Okay. If you don't come for the next
track I'll pull you on the floor.

169
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,360
Now let's work it boys!

170
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,920
Oh no! He is so irritating.

171
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,960
Take this drink. Have it.

172
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,440
Actually I don't smoke or drink.

173
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,520
Really?
- Yes.

174
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,880
Same here.

175
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,760
I don't understand why you need
alcohol for enjoyment.

176
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,400
I agree.
- Whoa!

177
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,440
Sorry! I didn't invite
you for my birthday.

178
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,920
It's okay.

179
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,080
I'm new here. So I called the people
Kavita suggested. Really sorry.

180
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,080
It's not a problem.

181
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,440
Anyway we are celebrating.

182
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,320
The track has changed.
Jehan will come. I'll step out.

183
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,840
Mittee! I'll come with you.

184
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,080
You sure?
- Sure. Come.

185
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,160
What are you thinking so seriously?

186
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,880
Actually I am thinking which
topic should we talk on.

187
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,200
Your favourite film.
- What?

188
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,200
Quickly. It's rapid fire question.

189
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,520
Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho'.

190
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,720
Hey, give a Bollywood name.

191
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,160
'Dil Chahta Hai'. And you?

192
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,800
'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani.'
Ranbir's fan for life.

193
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,680
Good choice.

194
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,520
Favourite City?

195
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
Amritsar.

196
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,400
The Golden Temple and the World's
best 'Chole Kulcha'.

197
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,120
Nice choice.
- Yours?

198
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,160
London.
My dream is settle down there.

199
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,560
Ask me something.

200
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,760
Okay.

201
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,960
Come on Sahil. Ask something funny.

202
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,920
Sorry!

203
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,400
Love marriage or arranged marriage?
- Arrange. Obviously.

204
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,520
I'm okay with my parentsâ choice.

205
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,040
You?

206
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
Love marriage.

207
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,160
Okay. This will be fun.

208
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,520
First kiss.

209
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,480
It's pending.

210
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,280
What? You never kissed?

211
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,440
You don't have a girl-friend?
- No.

212
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,400
Are you serious?

213
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,720
I thought I'm the only one who
hasn't kissed until now.

214
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,400
You know all my friends
make so much fun of me.

215
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,880
Just a second.

216
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,040
It means you haven't kissed yet?

217
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,840
No.
- Superb. It's coincidence.

218
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,800
What makes you happy?

219
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,400
No. I am not happy.

220
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,000
I was... just like that.

221
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,000
Why just like that?

222
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,920
Nothing.

223
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
God!

224
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,560
This is the oldest
Church of Shimla.

225
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,400
Venu and I often come here.

226
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
How sweet!

227
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,480
Do you have any best friend?

228
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,880
Dad! He's my best friend.

229
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,520
He's my strength and weakness too.

230
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,360
You?

231
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,480
Venu is my best friend.

232
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,920
Okay. Mom or dad?

233
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,400
Can't choose.
I was close to them equally.

234
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,240
What do you mean by I was?

235
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,800
They are no more.
- Oh! I'm so sorry.

236
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,240
Actually...
- It's okay.

237
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,400
It's 10 years now. It's fine.

238
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,880
When starting a new restaurant.

239
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,160
Making a menu is a main duty
that you will undertake...

240
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,480
as a restaurant owner.
- We all were at the club.

241
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,520
But you enjoyed the real party.

242
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,160
Which party?

243
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,880
Mittee Deora's party.
Did you do anything or not?

244
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,400
Come on, tell me.

245
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,840
I told you.

246
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,920
Why are you hiding from me?
It's okay if you did it.

247
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,960
Kavita, Sahil and I didn't kiss.

248
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,200
Hello!
- What are you doing?

249
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,280
Don't say you didn't
even hold her hand.

250
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,920
I didn't.

251
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,080
Why not? Everything holds hand.

252
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,280
Bloody useless! - What did
you both do for one hour?

253
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,640
Are you thinking of this
since morning? - Yes.

254
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,800
We chilled.
Spoke to each other. Played games.

255
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,320
Did you go to Karan Johar's show?
Rapid fire?

256
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,880
The idea was hers.

257
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,280
When a girl calls you for a walk
it means something else.

258
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,680
She won't give you a second chance.
Your game is over, bro.

259
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,960
Alright. My game is over.

260
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,120
Are you happy? Now go to sleep.

261
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,960
Good night.

262
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,320
Hey!

263
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:39,920
""You came like a breath
of fresh air!""

264
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:51,200
""You can be any language I'll
blend you in my own!""

265
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,640
""Your smile is the remedy
for my sorrow!""

266
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,520
""When I hear your footsteps I feel
a thousand lights are lit up!""

267
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,680
""When I meet you the surrounding
gets excited!""

268
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:13,680
""My eyes spark when I meet you!""

269
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:23,880
""You came like a breath
of fresh air!""

270
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:34,400
""You can be any language I'll
blend you in my own!""

271
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,200
""I feel relaxed when I
see your frizzy hair!""

272
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:05,920
""If you notice me I
don't feel lonely!""

273
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:20,840
""I live for you. My heart stops
beating when you touch me!""

274
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:26,840
""You are the word that
my heart has!""

275
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:33,920
""I am possessive about you!""

276
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:44,080
""You came like a breath
of fresh air!""

277
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:55,480
""You can be any language I'll
blend you in my own!""

278
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,800
I really like you a lot.

279
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,280
I love you Mittee!

280
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,360
I love you!

281
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,720
I love you too.

282
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,320
Sahil!

283
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,960
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,480
But... I am not ready for this.

285
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,800
I know I am behaving stupid
and old fashion. But...

286
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,080
I'm sorry Sahil.

287
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,400
Actually I'm sorry.

288
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,640
Maybe I was too... I mean.

289
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm sorry.

290
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,960
Wow! Perfect.

291
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,480
I don't have a shirt in red.

292
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,600
Red is my favourite colour
so I thought...

293
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I noticed it.

294
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,320
You mostly wear red clothes. Right?

295
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,920
Shall we go to Sky Land for dinner?

296
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,840
Yes. We can go.

297
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,640
It's our first dinner date.

298
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,960
But why a five star hotel?

299
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,920
We will go to Momo's.

300
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,680
No. Let's do something grand.

301
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,240
There are so many under privilege
people who don't get a meal.

302
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,800
We'll spend so much
money for one date.

303
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,080
I agree but...

304
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,520
I wanted to do something special
for us. That's it.

305
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,080
If you want to do anything special.

306
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,680
Then there are other
means to do it.

307
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,320
Any example?
- For example...

308
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,080
My parents celebrate my birthday
in an orphanage at Nodia.

309
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,520
That is so sweet Mittee.

310
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,280
If you want then...

311
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,280
We can donate a small amount
at that same orphanage.

312
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,440
Instead of this dinner.
- Superb idea!

313
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,280
Muskan foundation. Rs.10,000 only.

314
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,800
10,000?
- Yes.

315
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,840
Don't be stupid.
5,000 is sufficient.

316
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,480
Dad has left so much for me.

317
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,440
Anyway I don't have much expenses.
- Still Sahil.

318
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,440
Instead of lying in the bank it's
better it helps the orphans.

319
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,200
It's really okay.

320
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,320
And transfer.
- You are very stubborn.

321
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,360
True.
- Guys! - Hi!

322
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,480
Guest lecture at 6 PM.
You both have to be there.

323
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,080
Okay. See you.
- Thank you!

324
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,400
Mr. Kaif of Lion's group
is visiting us.

325
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,560
But we had a date today?
- Yes.

326
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
What to do?

327
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,640
Hospitality exist...

328
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,680
when we believe that the other
person is on our side.

329
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,680
My dear friends I want all
of you to believe...

330
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,760
that you are not merely management

331
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,360
students but you are in fact...

332
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,440
Where are you?

333
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,360
I am having severe headache.
I am sleeping.

334
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,480
Headache? I'm coming over.

335
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,200
No Sahil! Attend the lecture.

336
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,600
Please! It's important.

337
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,360
Alright. Take medicine and go to
sleep. You will feel better.

338
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
Good night.

339
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,760
You forced me to come here
though I had diarrhoea.

340
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,800
You got worried as Mittee
has a mere headache.

341
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,760
If she didn't have any headache she
would obviously attend the lecture.

342
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,360
Idiot!
Is headache bad or diarrhoea?

343
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,880
Any problems?
- What is wrong with you? - Venu.

344
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,040
Sorry sir!

345
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,960
What are you doing?
- I'm having diarrhoea.

346
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,120
People bunk lectures
to go on a date.

347
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,680
You bunked date and attended
the lecture.

348
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,240
You are stupid.
- Brother!

349
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:59,160
Yes. - The guy from 210 took pizza.
But he's not paying. Help me.

350
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,640
Who's order is it?
- Jehan.

351
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,880
Jehan!

352
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,240
He won't change. Let's go.

353
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,360
You take care of Jehan's bill.
I'll take care of my problem.

354
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,120
Let's go.

355
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,080
Go in.
- The door is open.

356
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,280
I'm knocking since some time. He's
not opening the door. Please check.

357
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
Jehan!

358
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
Jehan!

359
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,160
Jehan!

360
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,480
Jehan,
the pizza guy is waiting outside.

361
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,920
Jehan!

362
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
Sahil!

363
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,080
Love birds!

364
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,480
Sahil! Sahil, listen to me. Please!

365
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,080
Sahil!

366
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,440
You shouldn't have lied, Mittee.
You shouldn't have.

367
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,760
It's not about smoking or drinking.

368
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,160
You said you have headache
and were going to sleep.

369
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Whereas you were chilling
in Jehan's room.

370
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,120
The same Jehan who you feel is
cheap and irritating. Really?

371
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,520
Sahil! You didn't try to find out
why I didn't attend the lecture.

372
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,880
Why I had a headache?

373
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,040
Why?

374
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,480
My grandmother had an
attack last evening.

375
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,320
She is hospitalized.

376
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,160
Why didn't you tell me?

377
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,120
I was disturbed since yesterday. I
didn't share anything with anyone.

378
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,880
I wanted to tell you.

379
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,560
How is your grandmother now?

380
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,800
She is fine now.

381
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,720
She will get a discharge tomorrow.

382
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,840
Seeing you having drugs
yesterday...

383
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,480
I don't take drugs.

384
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,920
I was feeling so low.
I don't know why I took the drag.

385
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,840
Now I feel so stupid about it.

386
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,920
I swear on my grandmother, Sahil.

387
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,760
Anyway.

388
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,200
Forget what happened. I mean...

389
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,320
It's useless to think about this.

390
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,160
Sorry! Sorry! Just a second.

391
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,680
Good morning baby!

392
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,760
Good morning!
What message have you sent?

393
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,320
Last night Mr. Chenu
called at 1 AM.

394
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,920
I am going to Manali as the CA
has problem with accounts.

395
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,800
Oh! But we had a date today.

396
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,040
I know. I'm sorry. I couldn't
refuse Mr. Chenu.

397
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,680
We will go tomorrow after I return.

398
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,000
Alright. As you say.

399
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,280
Baby, it's 8.45 AM. Don't you
want to dress up. Wake up.

400
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,080
Yes. Love you. Bye!

401
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,920
Bye! Love you.

402
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,200
You know there is little...

403
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,040
Yes Venu. I've returned. The CA's
account problem got solved.

404
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,760
Listen. I'm very hungry.
I'll eat something.

405
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,160
Yes.
Alright. I'll get for you too. Bye.

406
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,840
Give me my phone.
Mittee, what are you doing?

407
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,240
Wait. I'll show you. Ah!

408
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,960
Jehan! Jehan!
- Oh!

409
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,080
What?

410
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,080
Hi Sahil!

411
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,800
You returned today itself?

412
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,520
What is happening here?

413
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,760
Wh... What?

414
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,960
We were just...

415
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,240
Just like that? - Dude! Chill out.
Why are you scaring the girl?

416
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,120
Don't interfere.

417
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,360
Mittee, go away from here.

418
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,480
I am talking to her.

419
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,080
I am talking to you, loser.

420
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,640
Sahil!

421
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:11,520
""Love is foolishness.
Loving is foolishness!""

422
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:19,800
""It's a sweet way of cheating.
Believing is foolishness!""

423
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:28,600
""The heart is like a piece of paper.
You will repent if you light it!""

424
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:37,800
""All your desires are
shed in tears!""

425
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:44,640
""Love is foolishness.
Loving is foolishness!""

426
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:53,240
""It's a sweet way of cheating.
Believing is foolishness!""

427
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:18,960
""Why are the promises false?
Why are nights painful?""

428
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:26,880
""Why are you crying?
Why this sleepless night?""

429
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:34,960
""Why did my heart break?
Why are morning's dark?""

430
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:43,240
""Why does my soul feel unwanted?""

431
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:53,200
""Love is foolishness.
Loving is foolishness!""

432
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:01,800
""It's a sweet way of cheating.
Believing is foolishness!""

433
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,200
Last 30 minutes to go!

434
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,400
Ma'am, supplement.

435
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
Ma'am!

436
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,800
Come with me.

437
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,480
The answers are on her thighs.

438
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,680
I was gesturing to you to
show what she is doing.

439
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,120
But you complained about her.

440
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,800
So? We are working hard and
she'll copy to pass.

441
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,880
Don't you think she deserved it?

442
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,560
She deserved it. But I don't know.

443
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,080
Mittee has to repeat this year.
That's final.

444
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,200
Sir, we broke our F.D's to
get Mittee this admission.

445
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,800
How will I get more money?

446
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,760
Mittee should have thought about it
before she copied her answers.

447
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,760
Sir! Sir! Sir, please!

448
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,880
Sir, I beg of you.

449
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,920
Sir! Don't do this.

450
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,240
Mr. Deora, what are you doing?
Get up. - Please!

451
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,240
Give one chance to my daughter.

452
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,840
Dad, what are you doing?

453
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,560
Please! Sit down. Come.

454
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,960
Dad is a heart patient.
He may get an attack.

455
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,800
Sir, please. Give me one chance.

456
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,240
Please!

457
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,040
I am giving you one last chance.

458
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,760
Yes.

459
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,400
But there is a condition.

460
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,240
Mittee can score any percentage
in her exam.

461
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,280
But in the final mark sheet the
college will give her only 35%.

462
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,560
I can't do anything more than this.

463
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,760
35%?

464
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,600
Listen guys. I am worried. One
of you must come with me.

465
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,960
I think we have to break
Mittee's door.

466
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,360
What happened?
- I don't know.

467
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,760
Kavita is knocking the door.
She's not opening it.

468
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,280
Sara! Sara! Relax!
- I hope she hasn't harmed herself.

469
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,080
Let's go and see what happened.
- Come on.

470
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,560
What happened?
- Open the door.

471
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,520
Open the door.
- Someone break the door.

472
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,480
Quick. Mittee.
- Sara, just relax!

473
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,600
Mittee, please wake up.
Mittee! Mittee!

474
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,480
Kavita, don't panic.
- Take care.

475
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,200
Mittee, please. - She will be
fine. - Mitte, speak to me.

476
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,440
Mittee! Mittee!
- Don't worry.

477
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,200
I don't know what happened to her.
Come along.

478
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,240
How is she now?

479
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,240
'Reports are normal.
But there's a bad news.'

480
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,760
What?

481
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,400
'Her grandmother died
this afternoon.'

482
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,760
What are you saying?

483
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,800
'Listen, the doctor is here.
I'll call you later.'

484
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,320
I was close to grandmother
after dad.

485
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,600
The worst part is I couldn't go
to Delhi because of my health.

486
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,160
I'm really sorry Mittee.

487
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,320
I heard about your 35% marks.

488
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,840
I didn't expect that...

489
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,480
the authorities will take
such strict action.

490
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,080
Why are you saying sorry?

491
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,760
I deserve it.

492
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,600
I'm sorry for everything.

493
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,440
I won't force you.

494
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,080
But if possible please
give me a chance.

495
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,320
Please!

496
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,960
Sahil! Sahil! Are you alright?

497
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,440
What happened?

498
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,640
It's done.
- Where?

499
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,640
Really? Let's ask Sahil.

500
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,040
Tell me who it belongs to.

501
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,600
I think it belongs to Ria ma'am.

502
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,040
It must be of Mr. Das.
It matches his shirt.

503
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,480
Right. My God!

504
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,200
She is so small.
It can't belong to Kavita at all.

505
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,800
Kavita!
- Just shut up.

506
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,880
Sahil! It's mine. Please stop him.

507
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,240
Hey! This belongs to Mittee.

508
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,600
Venu! Don't create a scene.
Give it here.

509
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,520
Here.

510
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,800
Sahil!
- Sahil! - Sahil, no.

511
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,880
Sahil! What are you doing?
- Sahil, leave him.

512
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,160
Sahil, let him go.

513
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,480
Are you fine?
- Are you mad? Why did you hit me?

514
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,920
Mittee, let's go.
- Venu. - He broke my hand.

515
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,480
Come.
- He is mad.

516
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,440
I shouldn't have told you.

517
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,720
The matter has escalated that
even Mr. Javed has found out.

518
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,920
Hey! Slowly.

519
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,560
Sorry Venu. It's my mistake.

520
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,440
It's the mistake of
his overreaction.

521
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,600
Did I find it?
How will I know who's it is?

522
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,160
Why didn't you stop
when you found out?

523
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:11,120
I was having fun. It's just her
undergarment. Why get angry?

524
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,320
If someone makes fun of your mom's
undergarment won't you get angry.

525
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,080
Why are you talking about my mom?
Why?

526
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,440
Such examples are given
to fools like you.

527
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,160
Your mom is no more. So you won't
understand the emotion.

528
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,320
Stop it guys. Stop it!

529
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,120
It shows that it was at
100% boiling fall.

530
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,960
Which is ideal for the
service industry.

531
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,840
The first part of the distillate
is the head. Followed by the...

532
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,960
Look here?

533
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,280
What is going on class?

534
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,200
What is this?
- What is happening?

535
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,440
Did you read it?
- What is happening here?

536
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,080
Anus!
- Anus!

537
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,560
What's wrong with all of you?

538
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,240
Anus Venu. - What?
- Jehan, what are you doing?

539
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,720
Sorry sir. Sorry.
- Venu?

540
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,200
Everyone has seen it.

541
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,800
What is Anus Venu?

542
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,080
Venu? Go back to your seat.

543
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,360
Oh no!

544
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,600
Where did you get the picture from?

545
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,080
Sources, bro.

546
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,880
Tell me clearly where
did you get it from?

547
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,600
I won't tell you. What will you do?
Hit me? Then hit me.

548
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,080
Hit me. Get that anger out.

549
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,240
Fool.

550
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,640
Let's go.

551
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,520
(Other language)

552
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,960
Sahil, what are you doing?
- Boys, hold him.

553
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,880
Sahil! Sahil!

554
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,120
Sahil!
- Mittee, are you okay?

555
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,520
Guys, stop it.
- Why are you hitting him?

556
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,600
Sahil has gone mad. - Guys!
Guys! - Ask him what he has done.

557
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,120
He was destroying everything
in my room.

558
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,800
What proof do you have
that he has done it?

559
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,440
If you don't believe it
then come to my room.

560
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,960
Guys, stop it. Leave it.
- Let him go!

561
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,960
Look at my laptop.
Notes. My parent's photo frame.

562
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,120
And look he has scribbled so badly
on Mittee's photograph.

563
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,600
What proof do you have that
Venu has done it? - Here...

564
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,960
What?

565
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,680
Sir, it was written on this room.

566
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,960
Yes. But where is it now?

567
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,160
I swear it was here.

568
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,800
Venu is right. He is actually mad.

569
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,440
How could you hit him?

570
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,760
Venu is nothing. He hit Mittee too.

571
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,560
Kavita, when did I hit Mittee?

572
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,320
Everyone knows what happened.
Mittee, let's go.

573
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:32,200
Sir! - Sir, I am telling you you
should take some action against it.

574
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,040
Tomorrow at 9 AM at Mr. Das cabin.
Be there.

575
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,800
Sir, listen to me.
- Let's go.

576
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,920
Mittee.

577
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,360
'Sahil got you caught.'

578
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,560
'He gestured to Venu.
And he complained to Miss D'souza.'

579
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,400
'Mittee has to repeat this year.
That's final.'

580
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,120
'How can I get more money?'

581
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,280
'Sir, I beg of you. Don't do this.'

582
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,920
'Give once chance to my daughter.'

583
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:33,880
Sahil Mehra, you bashed a wrong
girl. It will be fun now.

584
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,400
Mittee! Are you okay?

585
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,200
Yes. I am coming.

586
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,560
Are you alright?

587
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,360
I'm depressed Mittee.

588
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,840
Whatever is happening
is due to Venu.

589
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,960
He destroyed my room.
Broke my laptop.

590
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,600
Did you see how he scribbled
at your...

591
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,280
It was clearly written on the
wall your father is...

592
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,240
Who else besides Venu will do it?

593
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,400
If something was written on the
wall how did it disappear.

594
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,960
That's what I don't understand.

595
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,480
Mittee, I vow on you.
I am not lying.

596
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,960
At least you must trust me.

597
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,360
Of course I trust you. I really do.

598
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,400
Mittee.
- Yes.

599
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,760
Mittee, will you leave me?

600
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,160
I will never leave you. Never!

601
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,880
You look exhausted.
You must sleep now.

602
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,960
I am going crazy thinking
of the incident.

603
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,320
I love you!

604
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,680
I love you too.

605
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,520
Yes Mittee.

606
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,680
Mittee, what happened?

607
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,680
What is the room number
of Mittee Deora? Quick.

608
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,440
Quick.
- Yes.

609
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,400
Hello!

610
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,480
Mittee!

611
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,920
Mittee! Open the door.

612
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,520
Please open the door, Mittee.

613
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,040
Oh my God!

614
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,160
Who did this?

615
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,320
Mittee, tell me who did it?

616
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,120
Sahil!

617
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,840
What did he do?

618
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,280
He molested me.
- What?

619
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,480
It's paining.

620
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,360
Mittee! Mittee!

621
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,680
I informed Mr. Das.
Nothing will happen.

622
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,400
Mittee! Mittee!

623
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,320
You bastard.

624
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,720
Mittee!

625
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,560
Mittee!

626
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,760
You touched Mittee.

627
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,360
What are you doing?
- Are you crazy?

628
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,520
Sahil!
- Grab him. - Sir, are you okay?

629
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,320
Hey what's wrong with Sahil?
Stop it.

630
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,760
You touched Mittee.
- Sahil!

631
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:32,240
Stop it Sahil! - You touched Mittee.
- Stop him. What is he doing?

632
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,880
Are you mad?

633
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,680
How dare you?
- Sahil! - Grab him.

634
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,520
Sahil, hold him. - You will be
trapped. What are you doing?

635
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,480
Sahil!
- Sahil!

636
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,040
Sir!
- You?

637
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,280
Get up!
- Mr. Javed.

638
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,440
Is this a rape case?

639
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,600
I feel it is.

640
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,720
Tell me in one sentence
what happened?

641
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,280
Javed Siddhique molested
Mittee Deora.

642
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,480
And I bashed that guy.

643
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,960
You are arresting a wrong person.
Listen to me.

644
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,440
I was saving Mittee from that man.

645
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,760
Mr. Das, believe me.
You have a misunderstanding.

646
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,680
Sir, ask Mittee.
She will tell you the truth.

647
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,840
Venu! Venu, talk to them. Do you
think I can do something like this?

648
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,360
Friends, trust me.

649
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,480
Where are you going?
- Sir, I am from the college.

650
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,520
Harman was calling up. - What
happened? - They arrested Sahil.

651
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,840
And Mr. Javed?

652
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,640
He's in the ICU.
I'll go and check him.

653
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,440
Mittee! Mittee, are you fine?
I'll call the doctor.

654
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,520
Sir, I had gone to speak to Mittee.

655
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,960
To talk to her or for
something else?

656
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,040
Sir! I am not that kind of a boy.

657
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,360
Actually her dad is a heart
patient. He can't bear this news.

658
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,080
Alright. The secrecy of this
case will be maintained.

659
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,800
I'll treat you like a hero.

660
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,320
He had started dominating
Mittee too.

661
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,480
Sir, he behaved very unusual.
Either he was hyper or very quiet.

662
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,520
He looked calm.

663
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,600
No one understood what was
going on in his mind.

664
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,120
Whenever he lost his mind
heâs like an animal.

665
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,560
Absolutely out of control.

666
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,320
You have lot of anger.
Show it to me. Show it.

667
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,640
Sir, he was mad since a few weeks.
We were scared of him.

668
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,520
He called Venu his brother.
But he treated him badly.

669
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:18,240
To beat up a man like Mr. Javed
so much. Disgusting!

670
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,360
I had gone there as Mittee
asked me for help.

671
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,640
She was crying bitterly.

672
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,320
Did Mittee called you
on the intercom?

673
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,280
There is no record of the intercom.
So you will tell this.

674
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,240
Sir, take Mittee's statement once.

675
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,800
You will know the truth.

676
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,400
Mittee!

677
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,480
Miss Deora, what happened on
the night of 4th November?

678
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,880
Sahil came to my room
at around 10 PM.

679
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,080
We spoke to each other.

680
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,840
Then as usual.

681
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,840
He removed my top.
And tried to be physical with me.

682
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,160
What?

683
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,320
When I stopped him. He hit me.

684
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,480
He started abusing me.

685
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,680
Mittee! What are you saying?

686
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,840
Sahil called you...

687
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,640
to his room at night on 31st
July 2015 to study.

688
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:33,560
He kissed and raped you again
with your consensus.

689
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,400
Yes or no?

690
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,760
Mittee, that kiss was mutual.

691
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,600
She is lying. I didn't rape her.

692
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,440
Mr. Mehra, stay calm.

693
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,880
You will get a chance to speak.

694
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,920
Miss Deora, yes or no?

695
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,600
Yes.

696
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,680
Mittee,
why are you doing this to me?

697
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,920
Why are you lying?

698
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Something similar happened
on 4th November too.

699
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,120
Mittee stopped Sahil from
getting physical.

700
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,840
Sahil's male ego couldn't
tolerate it.

701
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,080
In that anger Sahil beat up...

702
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,440
Mittee, Javed Siddhiqui
and the 11 students.

703
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,560
All of them are lying.

704
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,440
They are cooking up
story to trap me.

705
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,560
Mr. Mehra,
this is the last warning.

706
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,160
If you speak out of
your turn again.

707
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,400
Or disturb the court's decorum.

708
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,200
I will charge you with
contempt of court.

709
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,920
Thank you sir.

710
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,920
Your honour.
I will tell you such a truth.

711
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,920
Hearing it everyone present
here will be shocked.

712
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,120
On 13th September 2007.

713
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,040
Sahil's mom, Anita Mehra.

714
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,800
Went into coma after she
slipped from the stairs.

715
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,840
After that Sahil Mehra was
severely disturbed.

716
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:56,120
Exactly 6 months later
15 year old Sahil...

717
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,000
under mysterious circumstances...

718
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,800
murdered his father mercilessly,
Anish Mehra.

719
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,520
He was imprisoned for
it for 3 years.

720
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,240
In 2008, 2009, 2010.

721
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,840
Sahil Mehra, is this story false?

722
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,120
Am I lying?

723
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,560
Mr. Mehra, please answer.

724
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,600
Your honour, the person who can kill
his father can go to any extend.

725
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,120
Sahil Mehra is a dangerous
criminal.

726
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,320
He is mentally sick.

727
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,040
Such a insane person living
a free life...

728
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,440
can be dangerous to society.

729
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,960
I request the honourable court.

730
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,600
To have a detail mental
examination of Sahil.

731
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,040
Only after that it reaches
to a conclusion.

732
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,760
That's all your honour.

733
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,800
After the examining the
medical reports...

734
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,160
the court has concluded...

735
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,480
Sahil Mehra is a patient of
Intermittent mental disorder.

736
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:57,560
Mischief. Obscene act. Assault.

737
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,040
And attempt to rape.

738
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,640
Under section 427.

739
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,160
294. 354.

740
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,520
And 511.

741
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,560
Would punishes some other criminal
with two and half year.

742
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,400
On the basis of Sahil Mehra's
mental disorder.

743
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,200
The court orders him to admit
him to Shimla Mental asylum.

744
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,440
Why did you do it?

745
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,240
'Listen guys,
we have to break Mittee's door.'

746
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,440
'-I just hope she hasn't harmed
herself. - Let's go.'

747
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,760
'Mittee! Mittee, please wake up.
- Mittee!'

748
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,680
'If possible please
give me a chance.'

749
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,120
'Alright. Tell me. Who's is it?'

750
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:58,120
'Sahil, it's mine.
Please stop them.'

751
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,200
'Stop it guys.'

752
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,840
Hold him tight. Stand stiff.

753
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,800
'Where did you get
the picture from?'

754
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,360
'I won't tell you.
What will you do?'

755
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,240
'Anus Venu.'

756
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,480
'What is Anus Venu?'

757
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,440
Come on.

758
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,200
'He entered my room and
destroyed everything.

759
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,040
What proof do you have
that he's done it?'

760
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,520
'Is this a rape case?
- I think so.'

761
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,440
'Sahil, Mr. Javed touched me.'

762
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,680
'Sir, please save me.'

763
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,760
'Ask Mittee she will
tell you the truth.'

764
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,640
'Looking gorgeous honey!'

765
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,680
It's all for you.

766
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,160
Today is your first meeting with
the company's director.

767
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,760
Are you nervous?

768
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,800
No. I am very excited.

769
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,080
I like the attitude.

770
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,760
As we all know the last chorus
for Stellar sweets...

771
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,800
In fact it was very difficult for
all the hospitality industry.

772
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:10,280
In the current market condition
9.5% growth year on...

773
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,880
is not easy.
But it's definitely possible.

774
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,960
To achieve this we have to
focus on three factors.

775
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,160
The power of the internet.
Revenue management and...

776
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,200
effective delegation.

777
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,880
This is the way to sustain in such
a complex and competitive market.

778
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,720
Sure. - Sure. - Correct!
- With this we can break for lunch?

779
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,960
Yes. - Yes. - Thank you
all. See you at 2 PM.

780
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,760
It got ruined towards the end.

781
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,560
It's okay. The rest was amazing.

782
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:53,680
Well done. Well done.
Apply the soap. - Birju!

783
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,920
What are you doing?
Do it properly.

784
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,480
Birju, don't fool again.

785
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,320
Get up. - Do it.
- The soap will go in the eyes.

786
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
What are you doing?
Be quick.

787
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,080
Patel, eat food.
Read the newspaper.

788
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,320
Nanu, give me some bread.

789
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,040
Ganju, how much will you eat?

790
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,800
You had 12 already.
Not anymore.

791
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,440
Ganju, why are you laughing?

792
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,200
I am not laughing but crying.
I am hungry.

793
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,160
Why are you crying?

794
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,360
I am not crying.
I am laughing. Look.

795
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,600
Hey! Mr. Hussain is leaving.
Say bye to him.

796
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,040
Bye. Bye.
- Bye-bye Hussain.

797
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,720
Bye!
- Bye!

798
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,960
Hussain, don't drink hot tea.

799
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,800
Your tongue gets burnt. Careful.

800
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,148
Hey! What happened?
- What happened?

801
00:59:08,228 --> 00:59:09,253
What happened?

802
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:12,840
Nothing. There is a patient who
gets violent on seeing red colour.

803
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,490
We need to be careful.
- Sorry!

804
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:16,480
Okay. - Come dad.
- Yes dear.

805
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,040
Dad, let's go.

806
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,440
Toothpaste.
- Don't send it today. Got it?

807
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,680
Nanu!

808
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,840
Haven't you slept?

809
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,160
Seeing the red colour...

810
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,600
I could control myself.

811
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,800
Is it?

812
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:52,480
I got angry even today.
But it has reduced.

813
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,640
This is good news.

814
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,280
You should talk to Dr. Irani.

815
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,720
Will he allow me to
leave this place?

816
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,040
You can try.
Why won't he let you go?

817
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,560
I feel Rinku is sleeping.
Go to sleep.

818
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,440
Good night.

819
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:17,960
Good night Nanu.

820
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,080
Honey! What day is today?

821
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,240
What? Is it our anniversary?

822
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,680
No. We informed our families about
us exactly six months ago.

823
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,280
Oh yes. Right. 11th.

824
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,400
We must celebrate tonight.
Call our friends home.

825
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,680
We will do it. Shall we do
something noble with it?

826
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:41,360
Cool! Shall we donate something
in your NGO Muskan?

827
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:42,720
One lakh is good.

828
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,160
Isn't it more?

829
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,000
Do it sweetheart.
I will be back in a moment.

830
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,240
Excuse me.
- Sure.

831
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,800
Mr. Govind,
it's such an honour to have you.

832
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,160
Excuse me?

833
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:58,640
Priyank?

834
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,280
What are you doing here? - Mittee,
you have played a big game.

835
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,480
From a trainee to a director.
Great!

836
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,560
I don't want to talk to you.
Go away from here.

837
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:11,320
Okay. When you find a rich man you
don't remember poor people.

838
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,120
Dear, I am your ex-lover.

839
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,840
Anuj is coming here.
Don't talk nonsense.

840
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,600
Good evening sir.
I am Priyank Sharma.

841
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,280
New Finnish Coffee Shop manager.

842
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,520
Hi!
- Shall we go? - Yes.

843
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,360
Sir! I wanted to talk to
you something important.

844
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,440
Yes tell me.

845
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,960
Sir, our relation is not like that.

846
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,760
But I want to share
something with you.

847
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,360
Sure.

848
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:43,200
Sir, the sale of our coffee shop
is up by 27% than last month.

849
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,240
That's great. Good job.
- Thank you sir.

850
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,680
Ma'am, I hope your experience
was comfortable.

851
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,920
Yes. Thanks.

852
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,560
Thank you ma'am. Thank you sir.
- Keep up the good work.

853
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,840
Bye sir. Bye ma'am. Bye. Good day!

854
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,920
Mittee Deora, watch it.

855
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,400
I will teach you a lesson for sure.

856
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,240
Red is just a colour.

857
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,320
Which we see all around us.

858
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:26,480
This colour has nothing
to do with that girl.

859
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,200
Okay.

860
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,720
Doctor Jha.

861
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:34,920
30% doctor.

862
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,280
Sahil, are you alright?

863
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,240
Dr. Jha, 50%.

864
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,760
Sahil, relax. Control your anger.

865
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Stop. Stop. Stop.

866
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,200
Increase it.

867
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:06,760
60.

868
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,760
Enough. Stop it.

869
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,440
60% intensity of red light.
And 80 seconds of time.

870
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,440
Last month you couldn't do 10
seconds on low intensity.

871
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,760
Good.

872
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,720
I could do it much better.

873
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,240
Very good. We'll try it next time.

874
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,120
Next patient please.
- Sahil, get up.

875
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,240
Doctor, there's so much improvement
in me. Let me go.

876
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:43,000
Relax boy! You have improved.
You are not healed.

877
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,760
Get up. Get up. Sahil, stand up.

878
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,920
What should I do to
get out of here?

879
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,080
Jha, just a moment.

880
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,360
Option 1.

881
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,480
You need a guarantor.

882
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:59,360
Like Mr. Hussain.
He is not with you.

883
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,480
So option 2. Impress me.

884
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:07,760
No complains and 100% results.

885
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,840
If you can do it for 3 months.

886
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,760
Then I can write to the authorities
and get you released.

887
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,480
Everything depends on me.

888
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:18,720
I will do it doctor.

889
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,280
Dad looks cool!

890
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,640
Excuse me?

891
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,640
Hello! - Hello dear your ex.
Priyank Desai.

892
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,960
That day you looked very rich.

893
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:34,320
Can I call you later? - Shall
I call up Mathur right away?

894
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,600
Alright. Tell me what's the issue?

895
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,960
I need one lakh.
Meet me at Coffee day at 6 PM.

896
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:43,160
I don't have it. - Even I don't have
it. That's why I am asking you.

897
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:46,360
If you don't come on time.
I will call up Mathur.

898
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:50,680
The rest depends on you.
Love you. Bye.

899
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,880
No brother.
We will do it on her next birthday.

900
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,840
Cancel. Cancel. Thank you. Bye.

901
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,360
What are you cancelling?

902
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,320
Actually I ordered a bracelet
for mom on her birthday.

903
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:09,400
As it's expensive I cancelled
the order.

904
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,720
How much does it cost?

905
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,040
Two lakhs.

906
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,800
It's out of my budget.

907
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,200
Take the money.
Give it on our behalf.

908
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,640
Anuj, I knew it. That's why I
don't tell you such things.

909
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,040
Babe, just take it.

910
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,600
Sahil!
- Yes. - Who is Surya?

911
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:46,520
Who is he?

912
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,400
Why?

913
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,920
He had a meeting with the
security head Mishra.

914
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,760
They want you to sign something.

915
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,360
They gave him lot of money.

916
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,520
Look here. They gave me too.

917
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,800
At 11 PM tomorrow all the CCTV...

918
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:04,960
camera will shut down for
10 minutes for servicing.

919
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,080
They will get him inside then.

920
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,240
What is the matter?

921
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,040
The food is here.
- Ganju, take this.

922
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,680
Yes. Yes.
- Patel.

923
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,160
Where is Sahil?
- He was sleeping.

924
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:28,840
What will we get in this?

925
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,600
Soup. Soup.
- What?

926
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,920
Soup.

927
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,720
Hussain, give me bread.

928
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,200
Are you unwell?

929
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:40,720
Why were you sleeping?

930
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,360
Slowly. It's hot.

931
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,320
What is wrong with him?
- I don't know.

932
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:47,840
Sahil, what happened?

933
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,200
Oh my God!

934
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,160
Sahil, are you mad?

935
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,440
Sahil, stop. Stop!
- Hey! - Nanu!

936
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,560
Chandu. Nanu.

937
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,720
Sahil!

938
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:07,760
Give that to me.
- Sahil! Sahil!

939
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,960
Sahil! Hold his hand,
- What is wrong with him?

940
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,320
He saw the red soup.

941
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,680
I knew he won't mend.

942
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,280
Not three months he will
be here for three years.

943
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,080
Pick him up and lock him.

944
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,640
You haven't eaten since morning.
Eat it.

945
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,960
I know nothing happened to you
seeing the red coloured soup.

946
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,040
Then why did you do it?

947
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,200
Won't you tell Nanu?

948
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,200
Alright. Don't speak to me.

949
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:48,360
He is my brother.

950
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,440
What?

951
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,400
Surya is my brother.

952
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,880
You said you don't have a family.

953
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,720
The one who can kill his
father so mercilessly.

954
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:08,880
He can't be anyone's relative.

955
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,920
What do you mean?
That rascal committed the murder.

956
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,560
And blamed you for it.

957
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,760
I am going to meet Dr. Irani.

958
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:25,960
I will tell him about what he
and Mishra are planning.

959
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:27,960
Nanu!

960
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,120
Don't say a word to anyone.

961
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:43,600
Lock it.

962
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,400
What is it? Do you want this?

963
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,520
Yes. I want it.

964
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,160
I won't give it to you.

965
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,640
Do you want it?

966
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,600
Alright.

967
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:32,280
Manju!
- I want it. I do.

968
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,440
You want it.

969
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,200
Mishra, they are here.

970
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,960
Did you check the car's number?
- Yes sir. It's them.

971
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,920
Alright. Allow them to come.

972
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,520
He is here.

973
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,240
Don't worry.
I'll be in this room too.

974
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,240
Did you get him?
- Yes. He's here.

975
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,160
I sent you to prison 13 years ago.

976
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,800
That girl sent you to
the mental asylum.

977
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:07,400
Sahil Mehra,
what else will you face?

978
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,880
Why did you kill dad?

979
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,400
Sign here. I'll reply after that.

980
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,280
First answer me.
Then I'll sign the documents.

981
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,320
He had a sharp tongue.

982
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,680
So I stabbed him with a scissor.

983
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,240
And blamed it on me?

984
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:40,280
I should have benefit for being a
twin. Right? Isn't it a smart move?

985
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,040
Sign it.

986
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,200
When I called you up for
help three years ago...

987
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:53,360
you didn't even speak to me. Why
should I sign the documents now?

988
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,040
Sign it!

989
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,240
Hey! Don't slap the patient.

990
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,320
Move out!
- Hey!

991
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:12,200
You?
- Is someone here? Call Dr. Irani.

992
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,080
Hey, who is he?
- I don't know. - 'Call Dr, Irani.'

993
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:19,320
Call Dr, Irani.
I'll seen everything.

994
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:24,480
Is someone here? I'll seen
everything. Call Dr. Irani.

995
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:25,880
Security, what are you doing?

996
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:29,440
Nanu, take care over here,
I'll check there.

997
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:30,920
Alright.

998
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:35,040
Sign it. Or I'll beat him up.

999
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,400
Here. Sign it.

1000
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,840
I'll seen everything.
- What is wrong with him?

1001
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:44,360
I don't know what he has seen.
- I'll seen everything.

1002
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:47,240
What did you see?
- Call Dr. Irani. I'll tell him.

1003
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,960
Shut up! Or I'll hit you.

1004
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:56,160
Call Dr. Irani.
Bobby saw everything.

1005
01:12:56,240 --> 01:13:00,040
Patel! Shut up! - Call Dr. Irani.
Bobby saw everything.

1006
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,720
Call Dr. Irani.
Bobby saw everything.

1007
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,520
Call Dr. Irani. Dr. Irani.

1008
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,120
Dr. Irani.
- Wait. I'll give you a shock.

1009
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,720
You don't have the machine here.

1010
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,480
Hey, call Dr. Irani.

1011
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,960
Thank you! Bye!

1012
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:01,040
Quick.

1013
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:06,080
You could wait for me.
Why did you hit him?

1014
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,960
I told him. You can speak to me.

1015
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,120
Jamal, go away.

1016
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,560
Okay.
Who are you to give this order?

1017
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,200
Keep an eye on the door.
I'll dress him up. - Alright.

1018
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,600
Go quickly.
- Okay.

1019
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,760
Mad.

1020
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,400
You are trying to trap me.

1021
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,320
You are like your father.

1022
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,880
You are like your father.

1023
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,120
Sahil!

1024
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:28,800
Open the door. Open the door.

1025
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:36,640
Why didn't you open the door?
Forget that. Sahil is getting mad.

1026
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,280
Take him away quickly.

1027
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,600
Let's go.
- Yes.

1028
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:45,920
Come.

1029
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:09,360
""Someone's end begins here.
The false blame on someone!""

1030
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,760
""Someone's life will be whirling!""

1031
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:16,400
'If you want this forever.
Then you have to help me.'

1032
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,280
'Alright. I'll do it.'

1033
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,520
'When all the lights are
switched off at night...

1034
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:23,440
Nanu will take me somewhere.'

1035
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:27,560
'After a short while the lights
outside your room will flicker.'

1036
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:29,840
'That is your signal.'

1037
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,880
'Immediately you will scream
at the top of your voice.'

1038
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,160
'Call Dr. Irani.
I've seen everything.'

1039
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:40,400
'Call Dr. Irani. Is someone here?'

1040
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:45,840
""I am mad. Be aware of me!""

1041
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:51,240
""I am mad.
I am mad. Be aware of me!""

1042
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:01,080
""I am not mad.
I'll bring out the truth!""

1043
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,480
""Don't understand me.

1044
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:06,280
I have no need. I need your
torture. I want you dead!""

1045
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:11,200
""I am mad.
I am mad. Be aware of me!""

1046
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:16,840
""I am mad.
I am mad. Be aware of me!""

1047
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,440
Sir, where do you I drop you?

1048
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,320
Home.

1049
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,720
Is someone here? Call Dr. Irani.

1050
01:18:58,440 --> 01:18:59,480
Dad?

1051
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,920
'I thought of pushing
him from the stairs.'

1052
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:09,080
'People will think he slipped
just like mom did.'

1053
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:14,080
'Then I thought no.
What if he lives.'

1054
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:17,960
'You don't have to give
exam tomorrow.'

1055
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,360
'You will be imprisoned.'

1056
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,320
'And if you refuse...

1057
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,840
I will kill you.'

1058
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,560
'And if the police or
anyone finds out...

1059
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,600
then I'll kill your mom.'

1060
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,280
'Save your mother.'

1061
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,080
What did you see last night?

1062
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,520
Tell me.

1063
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,280
I will tell Dr. Irani.

1064
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,480
I am Dr. Irani.

1065
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,320
Am I mad?

1066
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,960
I'll tell Dr. Irani what I saw.

1067
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,760
Jha, he hasn't seen anything.
Take him away.

1068
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,080
I gave you Sahilâs appearance.

1069
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:37,920
Now watch how I turn
you into a mad man.

1070
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:46,160
No!

1071
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:00,160
Listen.
- Yes. - Give me your phone.

1072
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,600
Yes.

1073
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:11,400
Why are you staring at me?

1074
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:12,800
Sorry sir.

1075
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:53,600
""I am torched.
My hatred is very extreme!""

1076
01:21:53,680 --> 01:22:03,880
""Wherever you are.
I'll reach there!""

1077
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:13,200
""How can I leave you? I'll break
you. The way you left me!""

1078
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:17,560
""Listen cruel one,
it's my turn now!""

1079
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:21,640
""You are very sweet
but full of venom!""

1080
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:32,240
""Yes, I am mad. I am mad!""

1081
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:43,040
""I am mad. I am mad!""

1082
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:44,680
Surprise!

1083
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:50,960
Kuttee Deora!

1084
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,280
What is this?

1085
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,920
This is Kavita's prank.
She's totally mad.

1086
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:03,720
She clicked this picture.

1087
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,080
Who is Kavita?

1088
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:07,640
Kavita!
My best friend from college.

1089
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,240
I told you about her.

1090
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:22,160
'If there is emotion
in business then

1091
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,400
it's not business but some serial.'

1092
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:28,440
'Do you understand?'

1093
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:37,360
Come. Come. Come.

1094
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,440
Sahil Mehra!

1095
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,440
Yes.

1096
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:09,960
""You are delicate to look at.
But you are a savage inside!""

1097
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:20,120
""I have borne your brutality.
I have done a lot for you!""

1098
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:29,560
""I was your protector. But not
anymore. I will plan to end you!""

1099
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:31,880
""I won't let you cry.

1100
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:37,960
Nor let you sleep.
I will give you sleepless nights!""

1101
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:40,960
2172.

1102
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:53,680
""Yes. I am mad. I am mad!""

1103
01:24:53,760 --> 01:25:01,760
""I am mad. I am mad!""

1104
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:17,120
""You are falling on my knees!""

1105
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:22,960
""Which you only know
who's your love!""

1106
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:29,160
""Some of my heart is falling
for another heart!""

1107
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:33,320
""For my soul!""

1108
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:43,040
""You can't beat me down!
I've been for love!""

1109
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:48,960
""You can't beat me down!""

1110
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:51,960
""You can't beat me down!""

1111
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:55,480
The battery?

1112
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,560
Honey, are you back?

1113
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:10,760
Come inside.

1114
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,600
Why did you do this to me, Mittee?

1115
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,960
Why did you do it with me?
Why? Why?

1116
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,680
Why did you do it?

1117
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,480
Speak up. Speak up.

1118
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,360
There's no one outside.

1119
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:06,440
Anuj,
I want to share something with you.

1120
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,640
A boy called Sahil was interested
in me at college.

1121
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:19,920
He always stared at me.
Tried to talk to me.

1122
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,040
One day he proposed to me.

1123
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:26,600
But I refused.

1124
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:30,320
I didn't know he would go mad
on hearing my refusal.

1125
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,320
He would beat up students
and teachers.

1126
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:35,640
This is nothing.

1127
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:39,200
I found out at the court he
murdered his father when he was 14.

1128
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:41,920
He was mad.

1129
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:45,200
He was sent to the mental asylum.

1130
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:47,960
It's three years now.

1131
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,640
Anuj, I'm sure.
He is discharged from there.

1132
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:53,040
He is doing things that
are happening here.

1133
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,800
Which asylum was he in?

1134
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,600
Shimla Mental Asylum.

1135
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:03,120
Shimla Mental Asylum.

1136
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:07,080
Sir, I wanted information
on Sahil Mehra.

1137
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:08,160
Who is speaking?

1138
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:09,680
I am his cousin speaking.

1139
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,040
Is he still admitted or
discharged from there?

1140
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,240
He is right here.

1141
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:16,680
Thank you! Thank you sir.

1142
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,040
Anuj, I'm sure he's not there.
But here.

1143
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,920
Mittee, how can one person
be at two places?

1144
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:28,640
Anuj! Come with me.
I want to check something.

1145
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:36,280
There is no movement.

1146
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:38,520
Wait. Play the footage further.

1147
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,400
How did you do it?

1148
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:47,680
It is complicated to explain it.
Let it be.

1149
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,600
This? I told you.

1150
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:02,240
Mittee, this is me.

1151
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Take this.

1152
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:17,880
No bro. It's complimentary.

1153
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:21,280
Why?

1154
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,640
Actually what she did to you.

1155
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:26,920
Some other girl did it to me too.

1156
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:36,720
Everyone says women are
unsafe in our country.

1157
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,600
I feel even men are not very safe.

1158
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,040
You are right, bro.

1159
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,080
I can feel you man.

1160
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:55,840
Yes dad.

1161
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:02,400
Dad, can you attend this meeting
instead of me? Please!

1162
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:08,920
Alright. Fine dad. Okay bye.

1163
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:15,800
Honey!
I have to go to Mumbai for 2 days.

1164
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:17,720
Mumbai?

1165
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,200
Hello sir!

1166
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:26,560
Good evening sir.

1167
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,040
Anything else?

1168
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:37,960
Sir, I wanted to show you
the sample of chainsaw.

1169
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,240
We have tested it.
The quality is very good.

1170
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:44,960
Sir, a dealer from Gurgaon...

1171
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,800
is ready to give us the same
design for 1/3rd prize.

1172
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:49,520
It will be best for profits too.

1173
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:52,760
How many pieces are we importing?

1174
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:54,280
Sir, we are exporting it.

1175
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:56,280
Yes. I meant export.

1176
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,360
Alright. How many pieces?

1177
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:00,440
5 lakh. You said that.

1178
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:02,680
I told you. Yes.

1179
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:06,600
And how is the quality
of the Gurgaon dealer?

1180
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:10,080
Sir, definitely the quality
is not as good as this one.

1181
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:11,320
But we can manage.

1182
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:15,400
I don't think of short
term but long term.

1183
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,320
If our quality is good
our sales will boom.

1184
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:20,480
And also profitability too.

1185
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:23,760
Right uncle?

1186
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,480
Right sir.

1187
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,760
Listen Priyank, I'm very busy
today. Don't irritate me.

1188
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:32,720
Your bank account is
going to Mumbai.

1189
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:35,320
You must be enjoying a lot.

1190
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:37,200
What do you want?

1191
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:39,560
Two lakhs.
- I don't have it.

1192
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:42,040
Alright. I have Anuj's number.
Shall I ask him?

1193
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:44,000
Priyank,
try to understand my situation.

1194
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,920
Meet me at 10 AM at VIP theatre
near Hanuman Temple.

1195
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:49,400
Priyank, listen.
- Stall. Seat number P17.

1196
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:52,280
Love you! Bye dear.
- Priyank.

1197
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:57,600
Even your father paid.
It's done now.

1198
01:31:58,480 --> 01:31:59,600
Good day uncle.

1199
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,960
I am Mittee's college friend.
Smiley!

1200
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:03,520
Hello!

1201
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:06,360
I was passing from here so
I thought of meeting you.

1202
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:09,000
It's good. Come inside.
- Right.

1203
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,680
Son, what do you do for a living?

1204
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:16,920
I settle accounts.

1205
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:21,760
I mean to say I work at my uncle's
hotel in accounts department.

1206
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:24,160
Oh! I see.

1207
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,400
Mittee must be returning home
anytime. Did you speak to her?

1208
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:29,840
I spoke to her a while ago.

1209
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:32,960
Please handover this
envelope to her.

1210
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,200
This?
- Yes.

1211
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,440
What is this?
- Cash of 10,000.

1212
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,600
Mittee donates on important
dayâs right?

1213
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:45,200
It's my birthday's donation
to Muskan NGO.

1214
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:47,160
Muskan?

1215
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:51,040
I don't know what charity
Mittee's does.

1216
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,200
True.

1217
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:55,120
Honestly, you can't know.

1218
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,520
Son, will you have tea?
- Yes.

1219
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:00,840
Aunt, next time. I have to leave
now. Thank you very much.

1220
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,080
Hey! Grandmother!

1221
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:11,160
I was sad to hear about her death.

1222
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:15,600
Mittee was very close to her right?
- You have a misunderstanding.

1223
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:18,200
Mittee didn't even see
her grandmother.

1224
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:23,240
She was in my womb when her
grandmother expired.

1225
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:30,080
Oh! Is it?

1226
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:35,440
Now I understand.

1227
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:38,840
Parking?

1228
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,080
Parking?
- Go straight to the basement.

1229
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:47,800
'Brother-in-law, let me go.
Or sister will be here.'

1230
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:50,160
'Do it quickly.'

1231
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:51,240
Move aside.

1232
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:55,280
'Brother-in-law, it's enough.
Let me leave now.'

1233
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:56,960
'It's just the beginning.'

1234
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,920
Where can I get the money from?

1235
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:01,600
I am calling up Anuj.
- Priyank?

1236
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:05,920
Priyank, please. Priyank.

1237
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Oh no!

1238
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:10,520
It's Rolex! Remove it.

1239
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,160
No. It's belongs to Manoj.

1240
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:14,960
Hey, you won't comply easily. Wait.

1241
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:16,440
Wait I'll call up Anuj.

1242
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:18,600
Priyank. I'll give it.

1243
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,560
'We aren't done yet.'

1244
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:22,760
It is worth 20 lakhs.

1245
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:24,840
Anuj will disapprove of it.

1246
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:28,880
20 lakhs. You are wearing my
3 years salary on your hand.

1247
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:33,200
Priyank.

1248
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:36,640
Why are you doing this?

1249
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,600
Hey, don't shed crocodile tears.
Just shut up.

1250
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:42,560
Did you forget what you did to me?

1251
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:47,960
Go away from here. Go!

1252
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:07,560
Somebody help!

1253
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:13,600
Is someone here?

1254
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:19,040
Mittee! Mittee, please help me.

1255
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:21,760
Mittee! Please help me.
- Kavita!

1256
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:23,800
Help me Mittee.

1257
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,200
Please save me.

1258
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:30,640
Help!

1259
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:35,680
Please help me!

1260
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:48,760
Mittee, please help me. Help!

1261
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:24,440
Hey! Why did you do it?

1262
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:43,440
But what were you doing
at that basement?

1263
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:46,000
It was Saturday.
So I had gone to the temple.

1264
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,760
I didn't find a parking there.
So I parked at VIP theatre.

1265
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:51,240
I didn't know he would come there.

1266
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:54,920
Anuj, he has reached my house.

1267
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,600
If anything happens
to my parents I...

1268
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:02,560
Yes sir.

1269
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,840
Okay. Alright thank you.

1270
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:09,480
What?

1271
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:12,400
The police says they don't
have any such complaint.

1272
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:16,840
Anuj! Did he kill Kavita?

1273
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:23,560
Hello! Is Kavita home?

1274
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:25,560
What?

1275
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:27,240
Kavita?

1276
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,840
What are you doing here?

1277
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:34,680
Last night Sahil chopped
your leg right?

1278
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:38,240
What? Chopped my leg?

1279
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:39,400
Who is Sahil?

1280
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:40,800
Sahil Mehra.

1281
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:43,960
Mittee, Sahil Mehra is in the
mental asylum since 3 years.

1282
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:45,960
Are you taking drugs?

1283
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:49,880
Mittee.
- Honestly.

1284
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:52,080
Sahil chopped her leg. I swear.

1285
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:57,320
I'm sorry sir.
But take her to a doctor.

1286
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,640
I feel she has gone mad just
like her ex-boyfriend.

1287
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:01,520
Ex-boyfriend?

1288
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:03,040
Yes. Sahil.

1289
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:05,960
Didn't she tell you about it?

1290
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:08,520
Anuj, let's go.

1291
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:10,280
Hey!
What the hell is wrong with you?

1292
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:13,400
Come on. - Mittee. - This
girl is very cunning.

1293
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:26,760
Yes. Are you enjoying it?

1294
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:28,840
A lot.

1295
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:32,320
But seriously.

1296
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:35,800
I am telling you despite being
a strong headed feminist.

1297
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,360
Don't let her go.

1298
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:41,720
After tormenting so many people
if she is left free...

1299
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:43,880
she will feel she has won.

1300
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:47,600
Don't worry.

1301
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:50,600
I won't let her win.

1302
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:55,080
Anuj, I'm sure I parked the
car here last night.

1303
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:57,720
Ma'am,
no car is allowed at this place.

1304
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:59,800
We are renovating the
place since 3 weeks.

1305
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:02,280
A board is put up here.
Work in progress.

1306
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:04,880
There was no such board here.

1307
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:06,920
And he asked me to park
at the basement.

1308
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:08,800
This man?
- Yes.

1309
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:12,080
Impossible!
He works during the day.

1310
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:18,080
Anuj, Sahil was pretending to
chop Kavita legs over here.

1311
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:19,800
I feel she has lost it.

1312
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:23,160
Anuj, they are a team.

1313
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:25,760
They are trying to frame me.

1314
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,480
You are saying the security here,
building security...

1315
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:33,600
police,
asylum and Kavita are in it.

1316
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:36,600
They have no work beside
trapping you.

1317
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:38,920
What nonsense!

1318
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:44,640
Anuj, listen to me. Anuj!

1319
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,480
Yes Sahil. They left just now.

1320
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:51,640
Was it him?

1321
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:54,680
No dear. He was a Sardar.

1322
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:56,920
Sardar?
- Yes.

1323
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:59,680
Okay. Can he look like this without
his beard and moustache?

1324
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:04,360
But Mittee, what is wrong? Tell us.

1325
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:06,520
Answer my question.
Don't question me.

1326
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:09,720
Look again.

1327
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:12,360
Was it him?

1328
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:15,600
No.
- No.

1329
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:18,680
Why are you nodding?
Look carefully. It was him.

1330
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:21,400
Enough. Enough.

1331
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:24,360
Come with me.

1332
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:31,200
The live CCTV feed of
high security unit.

1333
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:33,560
The patient is in front of you.

1334
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:37,680
Is he Sahil?

1335
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:42,960
Yes. But how can he be here?

1336
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:45,840
Thank you doctor.
- Welcome! - Let's go.

1337
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:48,160
I will go inside and see him.
- Impossible ma'am.

1338
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:50,360
The patients of that ward
are majorly dangerous

1339
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:51,880
criminals and mentally disturbed.

1340
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:53,640
Anuj, talk to him.

1341
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:57,600
Mittee, you saw Sahil here.

1342
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:02,040
I don't want to hear
his name again.

1343
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:03,720
Understand?

1344
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:11,320
Bittu, phone. Take the call.

1345
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:20,640
At 2 AM how did you remember me?

1346
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:22,760
Did he leave you?

1347
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:26,960
What? Is she mad?

1348
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:29,280
What problem is she getting into?

1349
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:33,840
2 lakh.

1350
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,840
Alright. Meet me at 10 AM tomorrow.

1351
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:48,360
Yes brother.
Mittee called me up just now.

1352
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:11,120
Whom will you shoot?

1353
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:13,080
It's for safety.

1354
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,680
Look,
whatever you do do it deliberately.

1355
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:22,320
Deliver the snack.
Yes, that car over there.

1356
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:28,480
Yes Kavita!

1357
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:29,800
There's a breaking news.

1358
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:34,480
What? - This Sunday Mittee and Anuj
Mathur are getting engaged.

1359
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:36,320
What are you saying?

1360
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:39,920
Moreover they will marry two
weeks later at London.

1361
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,040
They will settle there permanently.

1362
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:44,720
Are you serious?

1363
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:49,360
It means Anuj is ready to marry
her after all that happened.

1364
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:51,200
Yes!

1365
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:54,640
This girl must have performed well.

1366
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,680
Do something before she
runs away from India.

1367
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:58,160
We don't have much time.

1368
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:00,920
Kavita, hold on.

1369
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:02,720
Sir, I wanted your signature.

1370
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:04,760
It's urgent.

1371
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:11,440
Okay. Who told you?

1372
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,280
Anuj Mathur's dad had come to
invite my Hotel's promoter.

1373
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:18,000
Luckily I was present there.
So I heard them speaking.

1374
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:22,200
Is someone present there?
- Yes.

1375
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,600
If you want we can talk later.

1376
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:32,520
Alright.
I will call you later. Bye.

1377
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,040
Is there a problem?

1378
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:42,280
There's no problem Mr. Sahil Mehra.

1379
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:48,040
Sahil?

1380
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:51,440
Yes.
You can keep your neck straight.

1381
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:57,360
I alerted myself when
you spoke of quality.

1382
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:01,560
Surya never spoke of quality.
He spoke of only money.

1383
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,480
I doubted you earlier.

1384
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:06,400
Today you confirmed it.

1385
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:08,480
You did your signatures.

1386
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:12,040
Oh no!

1387
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:16,920
Where is Surya?

1388
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,320
At Shimla Mental Asylum.

1389
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,400
Asylum? What do you mean?

1390
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:27,560
Please don't tell anyone anything.
Please!

1391
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:31,360
I always felt you are innocent.

1392
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:33,600
You can't kill anyone.

1393
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:36,320
But I couldn't do much.

1394
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,680
I had no evidence.

1395
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:40,480
Don't worry. I'll do something.

1396
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:43,440
Three years ago when that
girl did the act...

1397
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:45,480
I tried to help you.

1398
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:47,680
But Surya found out.

1399
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:55,960
You were my father's servant.
Remain a servant.

1400
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:58,680
Don't try to enter the family.

1401
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:02,600
Hereafter if you try
to talk to Sahil.

1402
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:06,160
I will do exactly the same thing
what I did to my father.

1403
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:10,160
And your state will
be just like Sahil.

1404
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:19,960
I am pleased that rascal
is in that asylum now.

1405
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:21,680
And you are free.

1406
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,720
Sorry! I couldn't do much for you.

1407
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:30,560
But if I can do something
for you...

1408
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:32,760
don't hesitate to tell me.

1409
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:38,000
Congratulations!

1410
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:42,240
Congratulations to the beautiful
couple. Anuj and Mittee.

1411
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:44,800
You guys are truly made
for each other.

1412
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:48,040
Well, this is blessed day
for both the families.

1413
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:50,240
The Mathur's and the Deora's.

1414
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:53,680
Presenting to you all something
really special.

1415
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:55,640
Dim the lights please!

1416
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:09,040
Oh!

1417
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:29,480
Hi Mittee!
And hi the lucky man, Anuj Mathur.

1418
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:33,400
I am very happy today.
Finally Mittee found her dream man.

1419
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,160
Do you remember what
you said on the

1420
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:36,760
10th anniversary of Stellar sweets?

1421
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:38,280
I want to be rich babe.

1422
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:41,360
Look,
I will date my boss Anuj Mathur.

1423
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:42,880
You were a trainee.

1424
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:45,960
Guess what? Today you are
getting engaged to him.

1425
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:47,760
Now you are rich, babe.

1426
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:51,080
Hello Mittee.
Do you remember 35% marks?

1427
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:54,400
No money in the pocket. Trying to
pacify me twice in a day at office.

1428
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:58,040
Bilal, get me a job. Get me a job.

1429
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:00,760
And in a month Bilal
became your lover.

1430
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:02,760
We started dating.

1431
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:06,480
I managed to get a trainee's
position at Stellar sweets.

1432
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:09,840
After that you turned off the phone.
Number got changed. No contact.

1433
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:11,800
When I met you, you said...

1434
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:14,640
My parents won't allow me
to marry a Muslim guy.

1435
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:15,880
Sorry Bilal!

1436
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:20,080
Next month you found
your next lover.

1437
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:24,520
Mittee's best friend Kavita
and I were engaged.

1438
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:27,800
One day Kavita introduced
me to Mittee.

1439
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:31,240
After dinner when I went
to drop Mittee home.

1440
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:34,760
She started talking sexy
things with me.

1441
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:36,640
I...

1442
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:41,760
Within a week Anand broke
off the engagement.

1443
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:44,840
My cousin's took me for clubbing to
help me cope with my depression.

1444
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:48,320
Guess whom I see Anand
dancing with?

1445
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:49,720
Mittee Deora.

1446
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,960
She trapped Sahil Mehra the richest
boy of the class in Shimla.

1447
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:56,760
When they had an argument...

1448
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,920
she proved that normal
boy as unstable

1449
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,280
and sent him to the asylum.

1450
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:02,760
He is in the asylum
since three years.

1451
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:05,320
After Sahil was out of the way.
I was the next one.

1452
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:09,160
We didn't have a proper
relationship. We were just enjoying.

1453
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:12,560
During that time Mittee
took a loan of 35,000.

1454
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:16,600
When she had to return it she got
away with her dad's health stories.

1455
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:20,800
Look here. Your Rolex watch.
Mittee gave it to me.

1456
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:24,920
Your fiancÃ©e was 15 year
old and I was 22.

1457
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,520
We had an affair since then.

1458
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:28,560
I earned 10,000 a month.

1459
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,720
I gave her 5,000 out of it.

1460
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:34,320
One day my mom fell sick.
I exhausted my money.

1461
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,640
Mittee started blackmailing me.

1462
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:39,880
Give me money. Or I will imprison
you for sex with minor.

1463
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:43,200
I sold mom's earrings and
arranged the money.

1464
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:45,440
She is such a cheap girl.

1465
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:49,160
On our 5th month anniversary
she said...

1466
01:48:49,240 --> 01:48:51,040
Please let's donate 25,000.

1467
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:53,760
When I transferred the money...

1468
01:48:54,040 --> 01:48:56,200
She got a sms on her mobile.

1469
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:58,080
That alerted me too.

1470
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:00,480
I checked her phone.

1471
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:04,360
25,000 credited to Muskan NGO.

1472
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:08,240
It means she was the
false trustee...

1473
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:09,840
of that false NGO.

1474
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:12,480
I left her right there.

1475
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:14,960
And chapter closed.

1476
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:17,760
Sir, if you have to live alone
in life then live alone.

1477
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,200
But don't marry this girl
even by mistake.

1478
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:21,760
We told you the whole story.

1479
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:23,480
And you are intelligent.

1480
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:25,920
So save yourself and your family,
Mr. Mathur.

1481
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,200
All the best, dear boss!

1482
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:46,240
Anuj.

1483
01:49:57,480 --> 01:50:00,120
Go to hell.

1484
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:13,360
Shame on you!

1485
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:24,120
What is wrong with you?
What happened?

1486
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:25,880
Dad!
- Call the doctor.

1487
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:29,040
Dad! - Call the doctor.
- What happened? - Call the doctor.

1488
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:30,600
What happened?

1489
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:33,280
Call the ambulance.

1490
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:39,400
Leave us alone.

1491
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:41,520
For God's sake leave us alone.

1492
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:51,880
Hello!
- Hi Mittee.

1493
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:55,720
You bastard!

1494
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:57,960
Your dad is dying at the hospital.

1495
01:51:58,040 --> 01:51:59,760
And you are sleeping
peacefully at home.

1496
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:02,160
Aren't you worried about your dad?

1497
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:04,440
Don't speak about my dad.

1498
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:07,880
If you have the courage come to me.
I won't spare you.

1499
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:10,560
I won't spare you instead.

1500
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:14,760
I stole your bank account
I mean Anuj Mathur.

1501
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:18,960
Then showed your true face to
everyone and humiliated you.

1502
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:24,360
Now I'll steal from you the
most precious thing.

1503
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:27,240
Dad!

1504
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:32,400
I will kill you if anything
happens to dad.

1505
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:38,280
Hello! Hello!

1506
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:53,840
Dr. Sarah, come to O.T. right away.

1507
01:52:57,400 --> 01:52:58,400
Dad!

1508
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:10,040
Mittee, leave from here.

1509
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:13,560
You gave us enough sorrow.

1510
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:16,160
Mom, please let me meet dad once.

1511
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:20,240
He doesn't want to meet you.
Got it?

1512
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:23,360
Go away from here.

1513
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:26,920
Mom, please. Don't do this.
- Please!

1514
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:29,040
Dad!
- Go away from here.

1515
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:34,480
'Response ward. 2nd row.'

1516
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:43,600
'Hi Kuttee. I mean Mittee.'

1517
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:45,360
'Are you enjoying yourself?'

1518
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:48,040
'Why did you do this to me?'

1519
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:51,120
Come in front of me once.

1520
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:55,120
'You are crazy to get
rid of me earlier.'

1521
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:57,280
'Now you want to see me?'

1522
01:53:57,960 --> 01:53:59,960
Where are you?
- 'Turn'.

1523
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:05,040
What joke is this? Hello! Hello!

1524
01:54:08,160 --> 01:54:09,200
Hello!

1525
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:13,280
Our story is so dramatic.

1526
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:16,160
Come.
Let's make the climax interesting.

1527
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,720
You hit a girl. Rascal!

1528
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:20,960
Ma'am, are you alright?

1529
01:54:30,520 --> 01:54:31,840
'Who got shot?'

1530
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:34,240
Go away from here.
- No. No.

1531
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:35,960
Mittee Deora, come here.

1532
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:49,360
No. No wait here. Don't
go outside the room.

1533
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:53,200
Mittee! Here. Here.

1534
01:54:57,560 --> 01:54:59,080
Where are you running away?

1535
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:01,800
I am here to beat you.

1536
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:34,680
Ma'am,
you are not allowed to come here.

1537
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:36,400
It's a restricted area.
- Shut up.

1538
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:54,160
Ahh!
- Hey!

1539
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:25,280
Hey, wait.

1540
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:28,960
The girl is here.
She has gone upstairs.

1541
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:38,080
Sahil!

1542
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:09,520
Mittee!

1543
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:09,120
Switch on the fan.

1544
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:10,400
Shut up!

1545
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:13,800
Someone is here to meet you.

1546
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:20,880
Uh! Is it my dad?

1547
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:46,880
Surya Mehra. I am his twin brother.

1548
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:58,240
He didn't tell anyone about me.

1549
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:01,040
He hated me.

1550
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:06,320
As I killed my father
and blamed it on him.

1551
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:13,080
I went to meet him at the asylum
for some signatures.

1552
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,680
He trapped me and ran
away from there.

1553
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:22,760
He worried you and
me for two months.

1554
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:27,760
But the way you killed him...

1555
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:31,760
I was very happy to hear about it.

1556
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:35,520
I wanted to meet you personally
to thank you.

1557
01:59:38,280 --> 01:59:39,680
Thanks!

1558
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:45,520
I heard you got a life term.

1559
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:49,520
And your parents didn't
come for your hearing.

1560
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:52,240
Sad!

1561
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:54,680
But don't worry.

1562
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:58,640
I will help you somehow.

1563
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:03,800
You fulfilled my revenge
by killing Sahil.

1564
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:06,440
Say bye to him. Your time is up.

1565
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:12,760
Bye!

1566
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:38,360
Leave me.

1567
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:42,480
Leave me.

1568
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:50,200
'You have to get Surya out from
the asylum.' - 'What?'

1569
02:00:50,280 --> 02:00:52,080
'Mittee had taken a gun.'

1570
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:56,320
'I'm sure she will try to kill me
after her engagement breaks.'

1571
02:00:57,200 --> 02:01:00,280
'She will fire at Surya not me.'

1572
02:01:00,360 --> 02:01:02,120
Leave me.

1573
02:01:04,600 --> 02:01:07,800
'I am ready to take the
responsibility of Sahil Mehra.

1574
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:08,880
I am his uncle.'

1575
02:01:11,880 --> 02:01:16,800
""I am mad.
I am mad! Be aware of me!""

1576
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:19,920
'I have blood cancer. I am going
to London for the treatment.'

1577
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:22,080
'Before going home come
to the hospital

1578
02:01:22,160 --> 02:01:23,920
and take the legal papers from me.'

1579
02:01:24,640 --> 02:01:25,800
'Which hospital?'

1580
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:32,680
'Where are you?' - 'I am on the
first floor. Where are you?'

1581
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:34,680
'Come on the third floor.'

1582
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:42,040
""My quality is that I am crazy.
I do mistakes!""

1583
02:01:42,120 --> 02:01:44,520
""I am out of my mind and
my life is messed!""

1584
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:47,080
""I walk carefree. Stare at me!""

1585
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:49,760
""I did what you taught me.
This fight was fair!""

1586
02:01:53,080 --> 02:01:55,800
'Where are you?
Someone is firing here.'

1587
02:01:55,960 --> 02:01:57,680
'Come to 218. Quickly.'

1588
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:01,960
'Where is Sahil Mehra?'

1589
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:03,520
'Sahil!'

1590
02:02:06,240 --> 02:02:13,360
'The fight was fair!""

02:02:13,960 --> 02:02:19,080

I am mad. Be aware of me!""

""I am mad.
I am mad. Be aware of me!""

""I am torched.
My hatred is very extreme!""

1594
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:30,800
""Wherever you are.
I'll reach there!""

1595
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:39,880
""How can I leave you? I'll break
you! The way you broke me!""

1596
02:03:39,960 --> 02:03:44,360
""Listen cruel one.
Now it's my turn!""

1597
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:48,600
""You are very sweet.
But full of venom!""

1598
02:03:50,440 --> 02:03:59,360
""Yes. I am mad. I am mad!""

1599
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:09,240
""I am mad. I am mad!""

1600
02:04:32,200 --> 02:04:38,480
""Why did you do this?
You cheated me!""

1601
02:04:41,320 --> 02:04:46,600
""Why did you wound me?""

1602
02:05:06,440 --> 02:05:15,600
""You are delicate to look at.
But you are a savage inside!""

1603
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:25,960
""I have borne your brutality.
I have done a lot for you!""

1604
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:30,560
""I was your protector.
But not anymore!""

1605
02:05:30,640 --> 02:05:35,200
""I will think of ending your life!""

1606
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:39,800
""I won't let you cry.
Nor allow you to sleep!""

1607
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:43,680
""I will give you sleepless nights!""

1608
02:05:45,640 --> 02:05:53,400
""Yes. I am mad. I am mad!""

Either there is ash or smoke.

00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:15,884
Why do they tolerate
this smoke quietly?

4
00:00:16,627 --> 00:00:18,485
It's the limit to tolerance.

5
00:00:19,113 --> 00:00:21,976
Let douse cigarettes and cigars.

6
00:00:22,362 --> 00:00:24,369
There is ban on smoking
on public places.

7
00:00:24,803 --> 00:00:26,805
You've to pay fine for it.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,033
Neither smoking nor
let others smoking.

9
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,912
Smoking costs dearly.

10
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:39,138
Everyone desires happiness.

11
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,828
But at what cost?

12
00:00:44,756 --> 00:00:47,319
Smoking costs dearly.

13
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:52,223
Smoking is injurious
to your health..

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,776
..to your loves ones too.

15
00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:02,732
You've to pay dearly for smoking.

16
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,490
Good morning, guys.
- Good morning, sir

17
00:03:17,724 --> 00:03:18,724
What's happening?

18
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:19,924
Sir, we're doing the lighting.

19
00:03:23,324 --> 00:03:24,633
Fine, fine.

20
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:27,739
Mohit, what's up?

21
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:31,126
How did you call me today?

22
00:03:31,524 --> 00:03:33,219
No, man. Shooting.

23
00:03:34,244 --> 00:03:35,499
GH Mills.

24
00:03:36,604 --> 00:03:37,914
Royal Mansions.

25
00:03:38,524 --> 00:03:39,579
It's a feature.

26
00:03:40,244 --> 00:03:41,124
What?

27
00:03:41,164 --> 00:03:42,164
Tonight?

28
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,094
For what?

29
00:03:44,644 --> 00:03:46,044
Narration.

30
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:49,478
Narration only?

31
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:51,964
Okay. I'll be there.

32
00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:53,964
Ma'am, shot is ready.

33
00:03:54,044 --> 00:03:55,524
Scene 10 by Take 1.

34
00:03:56,284 --> 00:03:57,572
And...action!

35
00:04:18,244 --> 00:04:20,137
What happened to Madam,
Get the water quickly.

36
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:32,884
""Where do we go?""

37
00:04:33,884 --> 00:04:37,964
""Where do we go?""

38
00:04:38,953 --> 00:04:43,404
""Who will understand...""

39
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:48,844
""..the sad story of the ghosts.""

40
00:04:49,204 --> 00:04:53,362
""Where do we go?""

41
00:04:54,364 --> 00:04:58,084
""Where do we go?""

42
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:14,604
""What's happening in
the name of progress?""

43
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:24,804
""What's happening in
the name of progress?""

44
00:05:25,004 --> 00:05:29,764
""The bulldozer's
razing down our homes.""

45
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,884
""Shopping malls and Multiplex..""

46
00:05:35,244 --> 00:05:39,804
""..are snatching our graves.""

47
00:05:40,364 --> 00:05:45,364
""O Government, hear our plea.""

48
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:48,964
""Where do we go?""

49
00:05:50,724 --> 00:05:54,564
""Where do we go?""

50
00:06:05,924 --> 00:06:10,724
""There's no one with us.""

51
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:21,124
""There's no one with us.""

52
00:06:21,444 --> 00:06:26,084
""Ghosts have become helpless.""

53
00:06:26,404 --> 00:06:31,204
""We don't have the
right to vote either.""

54
00:06:31,635 --> 00:06:36,284
""Even the politicians shun us.""

55
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:41,564
""O Government, hear our plea.""

56
00:06:41,844 --> 00:06:45,484
""Where do we go?""

57
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:50,764
""Where do we go?""

58
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:54,324
""Where do we go?""

59
00:06:54,684 --> 00:06:57,004
""Where do we go?""

60
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,364
""Where do we go?""

61
00:06:59,524 --> 00:07:01,884
""Where do we go?""

62
00:07:02,044 --> 00:07:04,764
""Where do we go?""

63
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:11,884
What a scary structure, right?

64
00:07:12,082 --> 00:07:13,844
So old and dilapidated.

65
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:15,219
Yes.

66
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:17,924
Most of the disputed properties in
Mumbai are in the same condition.

67
00:07:18,223 --> 00:07:20,844
Aditya, Do you
remember that Ragini incident?

68
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:23,084
Yes, that ghost affair.
- Yes.

69
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:24,364
Just imagine.

70
00:07:24,626 --> 00:07:27,124
Ragini must be going
through some serious PR crises.

71
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:28,964
Why such cheap publicity?

72
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:31,163
Today's marketing mantra is..

73
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:33,764
..any publicity is good publicity.

74
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:35,084
If you want to promote your film.

75
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:36,588
And her act worked.

76
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,708
Her story was all over.

77
00:07:38,844 --> 00:07:41,868
News, TV, internet. Everywhere.

78
00:07:42,148 --> 00:07:44,028
Ghost stories intrigue everyone.

79
00:07:44,108 --> 00:07:46,758
No wonder that such films
are made and run successfully.

80
00:07:48,428 --> 00:07:49,428
What happened?

81
00:07:49,748 --> 00:07:51,188
I really don't understand.

82
00:07:51,468 --> 00:07:54,108
In Raaz 3, Esha Gupta knows..

83
00:07:54,188 --> 00:07:55,908
..that the house she's
living in is haunted.

84
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:57,908
So why doesn't she just leave?

85
00:07:58,188 --> 00:08:01,108
Tanya, if you try to find
logic in the ghost stories.

86
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:04,228
..then you are going to see only
ghosts at the box-office window.

87
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:07,188
And Bhootnath, Amitabh
Bachchan is a ghost..

88
00:08:07,268 --> 00:08:09,548
..who is visible to a kid,
but not Juhi Chawla.

89
00:08:09,628 --> 00:08:11,628
And in the climax, even
Juhi Chawla can see him.

90
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:12,807
Again Logic.

91
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:15,148
It is up to the ghost to decide..

92
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,484
..who can see him and who cannot.

93
00:08:18,228 --> 00:08:20,748
Mostly ghosts are seen..

94
00:08:20,828 --> 00:08:22,508
..to those people
who are in trouble.

95
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:26,388
Or someone who create
troubles for them. Get it?

96
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:27,868
Good morning, sir.

97
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:30,388
You..
- Raju, sir.

98
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:31,708
Raju writer.

99
00:08:31,988 --> 00:08:34,788
Oh yes yes.
What are you doing here?

100
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:36,628
Sir, I was here to see
location with someone...

101
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,428
I saw you here then I
thought to meet you.

102
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:40,428
That's the real job of
a struggling writer.

103
00:08:41,628 --> 00:08:43,508
So, what do you want?
- Sir I want one single chance.

104
00:08:43,588 --> 00:08:45,148
Sir, I've a superhit idea, sir.

105
00:08:45,188 --> 00:08:46,348
Sir, just give me one hearing.

106
00:08:46,428 --> 00:08:48,588
Sir FIMFARE, ZEE, IIFA, TOIFA,

107
00:08:48,668 --> 00:08:50,108
..Even the Lion's club
award will be yours sir.

108
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:51,388
Sir, just hear me once.

109
00:08:51,468 --> 00:08:53,348
You are here also... Ok
leave from here.. Get out.

110
00:08:53,428 --> 00:08:55,908
Mr. Gupta, remember I
came to your office.

111
00:08:55,988 --> 00:08:57,588
Yes, unwanted.
- And I hugged you..

112
00:08:57,628 --> 00:08:59,268
..in your last
film's success party.

113
00:08:59,348 --> 00:09:01,468
Remember, sir.
- You had crashed the gate at the party.

114
00:09:01,548 --> 00:09:02,548
And gulped down the entire bottle.

115
00:09:02,628 --> 00:09:04,308
Now Just get out from here,
or I'll make you regret it.

116
00:09:04,388 --> 00:09:06,668
Mr. Gupta,
What else can you do with me?

117
00:09:06,748 --> 00:09:08,028
I've been struggling for 5 years..

118
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:09,228
..but I couldn't get one break.

119
00:09:09,308 --> 00:09:10,828
No place to stay, no food to eat.

120
00:09:10,908 --> 00:09:12,068
But no problem, sir.

121
00:09:12,148 --> 00:09:13,588
The day will come soon when..

122
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:15,668
..a lucky director
will accept my story..

123
00:09:15,748 --> 00:09:18,148
..and make a
super-duper blockbuster film.

124
00:09:18,228 --> 00:09:20,428
And then it will be
your loss, sir, not mine.

125
00:09:20,508 --> 00:09:21,948
Because I might be unfortunate..

126
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,068
..but I have hunger in me,
I've confidence.

127
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:26,348
If you're hungry, go and
have some fritters. Get out.

128
00:09:26,476 --> 00:09:29,188
I will, sir. I will eat that.

129
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,348
But remember one thing.

130
00:09:31,577 --> 00:09:33,868
Those who eat fritters
during their bad phase..

131
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,268
..They will be
exorbitant at their good time.

132
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,068
Bye, sir.

133
00:09:44,452 --> 00:09:45,938
I wonder how he got in here.

134
00:09:47,434 --> 00:09:49,514
Filmy strugglers are
like unwanted messages.

135
00:09:49,594 --> 00:09:52,952
No matter how many times you
delete them they keep coming.

136
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:54,714
It is very frustrating.

137
00:09:54,754 --> 00:09:56,354
Aditya, this is Hemantbhai.

138
00:09:56,594 --> 00:09:57,600
He will take us around.

139
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,794
Hi, Hemantbhai.

140
00:09:59,034 --> 00:10:01,554
I am Aditya, Hi and
this is Tanya, my AD.

141
00:10:03,754 --> 00:10:06,080
Which is the latest film
that you made?

142
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:09,079
No feature film yet.

143
00:10:09,354 --> 00:10:11,132
No feature film yet.

144
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,161
Nice title.

145
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:14,994
Hemant, he makes commercials.

146
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:16,501
It's important
to make commercials..

147
00:10:16,706 --> 00:10:18,978
..otherwise people don't like it.

148
00:10:19,594 --> 00:10:20,834
Are you casting Salman?

149
00:10:20,914 --> 00:10:23,954
Hemantbhai, he wants to
say that I make ad-films.

150
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:26,912
Advertisement films.
- I see.

151
00:10:26,952 --> 00:10:28,874
The things that bore you..

152
00:10:28,914 --> 00:10:30,754
..between TV serials and news.

153
00:10:30,794 --> 00:10:31,794
Frustrating.

154
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:37,554
In 1932, the workers burned
this mill down to the ground.

155
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:38,714
Frustrating.

156
00:10:38,874 --> 00:10:41,194
And from 1985 till now..

157
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:44,554
..around 50-60 films
have been shot here.

158
00:10:46,194 --> 00:10:48,754
100 years ago, Gaindamal..

159
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:51,874
..built this mansion on
the plot next to his mill.

160
00:10:51,914 --> 00:10:54,914
To entertain his British guests.

161
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,554
After the Lingering doubt shoot..

162
00:10:56,634 --> 00:10:58,474
..he's been renting it
out for shootings again.

163
00:10:58,594 --> 00:11:00,114
You're the first director..

164
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:01,674
..who's come here
after that incident.

165
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,954
Otherwise it was closed
for the last one year.

166
00:11:04,154 --> 00:11:05,354
No income.

167
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:07,114
It was frustrating.

168
00:11:07,474 --> 00:11:10,634
Wow. What a mansion, Hemantbhai.
- Thank you.

169
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:13,194
I want to see every part
of this mansion and mill.

170
00:11:13,354 --> 00:11:15,834
But I am here only
for half an hour.

171
00:11:16,514 --> 00:11:17,536
Come, Tanya.

172
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:20,714
Well there are many rooms here.

173
00:11:20,874 --> 00:11:22,434
What do you exactly want?

174
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:24,954
We want a room and a verandah.

175
00:11:25,154 --> 00:11:26,794
And if we can get the terrace,
that will be even better.

176
00:11:34,114 --> 00:11:36,954
Mr. Director, here's your verandah.

177
00:11:37,034 --> 00:11:38,874
And here's the terrace.

178
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:40,194
Is this what you wanted?

179
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:41,594
Wow, great.

180
00:11:41,794 --> 00:11:42,914
It's Beautiful.

181
00:11:43,714 --> 00:11:45,954
Now this is nice.

182
00:11:46,394 --> 00:11:49,634
Listen, here our actor
will swing on a chair.

183
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,150
Right here.
- Okay.

184
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:54,194
And then we'll get the
entire city in the background.

185
00:11:54,787 --> 00:11:57,394
Then the scene will look great.

186
00:11:57,754 --> 00:11:59,434
Script and storyboard
is in the laptop.

187
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:00,874
Should I switch it on?

188
00:12:01,051 --> 00:12:03,685
My dear Script is always
in the director's mind.

189
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,417
I don't need a laptop.

190
00:12:06,605 --> 00:12:07,714
Once Sumit will come..

191
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,674
..then we'll
finalize our shot divisions.

192
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:10,929
Cool.

193
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,034
And before that, let's
see the entire house.

194
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:15,554
You go ahead, I'll be right there.

195
00:12:15,714 --> 00:12:19,194
Hemantbhai. These actors can
do anything for publicity.

196
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:22,314
Gupta, stop gossiping.
- No, sir.

197
00:12:22,394 --> 00:12:24,994
I was talking about Ragini's case.

198
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:27,314
She saw a ghost
during the shooting.

199
00:12:30,074 --> 00:12:32,434
I think these rumors are true.

200
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,434
It's an old mansion.

201
00:12:34,594 --> 00:12:36,234
It has to be infested by ghosts.

202
00:12:36,314 --> 00:12:37,434
Has to be?

203
00:12:37,554 --> 00:12:38,554
It is.

204
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:42,074
Don't smoke.

205
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:45,434
Don't smoke.

206
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,514
Tanya.

207
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:48,194
Coming.

208
00:12:50,914 --> 00:12:53,714
Listen, smoke but be around.

209
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:55,145
If you smoke alone..

210
00:12:55,185 --> 00:12:56,954
..the ghost will snatch
your cigarette.

211
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,987
What rubbish?
- Ask them.

212
00:13:02,674 --> 00:13:05,025
This is the most
beautiful room of the mansion.

213
00:13:05,594 --> 00:13:07,838
Wow, Hemantbhai. This is great.

214
00:13:08,794 --> 00:13:10,474
There's a bar and a stage too.

215
00:13:11,194 --> 00:13:12,194
Yes Beautiful.

216
00:13:12,234 --> 00:13:14,714
So many musical instruments.
- Exactly.

217
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:16,794
Is this a hall or a music room?

218
00:13:16,986 --> 00:13:18,994
This is where the
entertainment would take place.

219
00:13:19,434 --> 00:13:20,954
Famous Dancers performed here.

220
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,834
Renowned singers like
Ustad Allauddin Khan..

221
00:13:23,954 --> 00:13:26,554
..Baiju Bawra sir
harmonized this place.

222
00:13:34,634 --> 00:13:35,754
Hemantbhai.

223
00:13:38,674 --> 00:13:41,674
By the way, is this
mansion really haunted?

224
00:13:42,076 --> 00:13:43,154
Yes, it is.

225
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,474
Then it must have
scary stories as well.

226
00:13:47,714 --> 00:13:50,154
This house has an unusual past.

227
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,754
They say this house is cursed.

228
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:57,714
After Gaindamal murdered by
the hands of the Mill workers..

229
00:13:58,361 --> 00:14:02,674
..Gaindamal's soul roam
around here in the mansion.

230
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,634
Jesus!

231
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,874
Aditya, change your ringtone.
- Aditya, sir.

232
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:08,394
What Aditya sir..
It's was scary.

233
00:14:08,618 --> 00:14:09,674
Yes, Sumit Da. Yes.

234
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:11,803
Yes, I can hear.

235
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:14,713
What, you're stuck?

236
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:18,393
Oh, rail blockage
against land acquisition.

237
00:14:18,753 --> 00:14:19,873
So what will we do now?

238
00:14:20,513 --> 00:14:22,113
No, the shoot is
day after tomorrow.

239
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:23,827
No, it's not possible tomorrow.

240
00:14:23,867 --> 00:14:25,633
I've an important meeting tomorrow.

241
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:26,773
Yes.

242
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,053
Fine, Ok! let me talk to Hemant.

243
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:31,333
I'll try to get his permission.

244
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:32,413
Okay.

245
00:14:34,413 --> 00:14:35,173
No.

246
00:14:35,213 --> 00:14:36,213
I won't stay.

247
00:14:36,253 --> 00:14:37,493
I won't stay back.

248
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:40,893
Today, There's a hearing in
the High Court for Royal Mansion.

249
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:43,053
The great grandsons of Gaindamal..

250
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,613
..are fighting in the
court for this property.

251
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:47,213
I've to go with them.

252
00:14:47,293 --> 00:14:48,653
It's frustrating.

253
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:50,998
Hemant, leave the
keys with the watchman.

254
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:54,613
Who would come to a house
that's haunted by ghosts.

255
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,614
I did appoint one...but
the ghosts drove him away.

256
00:14:57,693 --> 00:14:58,933
What are you saying?

257
00:14:59,093 --> 00:15:00,573
The entire house is
filled with antiques.

258
00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:02,333
And everything must be expensive.

259
00:15:02,413 --> 00:15:04,013
Yes, they say that..

260
00:15:04,093 --> 00:15:06,573
..there's a huge treasure
buried under this house too.

261
00:15:06,653 --> 00:15:08,053
You mean hidden treasure.

262
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:12,333
People have seen golden
coins of the British era.

263
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:14,093
That's why I don't
give the keys to anyone.

264
00:15:14,173 --> 00:15:16,133
Hemantbhai. Hemantbhai.
- No, no.

265
00:15:16,213 --> 00:15:17,893
Have faith, I'll bring the keys.

266
00:15:17,973 --> 00:15:19,853
Tanya, please.
- Hemantbhai, please.

267
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:21,893
Please, please, please, let it be.

268
00:15:21,973 --> 00:15:22,973
Please.

269
00:15:23,493 --> 00:15:25,333
Please is what gets us in the end.

270
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,093
Fine.

271
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:29,253
Please. Here are the keys.

272
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,453
Thank you so much.
- Thank you very much.

273
00:15:31,855 --> 00:15:34,013
Thank you so much, Hemantbhai.

274
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,133
Thank you.

275
00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:40,293
Really, Tanya.

276
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:44,253
Your magical embrace
cast a spell on Hemantbhai.

277
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:46,253
Come on.
I hugged him out of affection.

278
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,333
Yes, right.

279
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,133
Sir, what will we
do for next two hours?

280
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:51,373
I will have to wait for Sumit Da.

281
00:15:51,573 --> 00:15:53,533
I've to discuss the
shot divisions with him.

282
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:56,813
I suggest that you two
go to the police station.

283
00:15:57,013 --> 00:16:00,093
And get the permissions
for next week's shoot.

284
00:16:00,215 --> 00:16:01,133
That's a good idea.

285
00:16:01,173 --> 00:16:03,413
Yeah, even I've to meet
with the costume dada, so..

286
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,173
Great. You guys get going then.

287
00:16:05,253 --> 00:16:06,413
Leave the keys with me.

288
00:16:06,493 --> 00:16:07,493
Okay.

289
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,773
Will you manage it alone?
- Yes.

290
00:16:10,438 --> 00:16:11,720
Camera, laptop.

291
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:12,773
Thank you.
- Take care.

292
00:16:12,813 --> 00:16:13,653
Yes, I will.

293
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:15,333
Bye, sir.
- Bye, Gupta.

294
00:18:04,373 --> 00:18:05,933
Sir.
- Who is it? Who is it?

295
00:18:06,223 --> 00:18:07,853
Sir, it's me. Raju writer, sir.

296
00:18:08,374 --> 00:18:10,149
You?
You're back again.

297
00:18:10,955 --> 00:18:11,955
What do you want now?

298
00:18:12,035 --> 00:18:13,275
Sir, neither money nor credit.

299
00:18:13,515 --> 00:18:14,795
I just need a break.

300
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:18,275
Oh God! You don't need a break
But I really need one from you.

301
00:18:18,315 --> 00:18:20,035
That's exactly what
I want to give, sir.

302
00:18:20,075 --> 00:18:22,196
I want to give you a break
to make a film on my story.

303
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:23,635
I am just joking, sir.

304
00:18:23,675 --> 00:18:25,195
Sir, please hear my story once.

305
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:26,835
Sir, I've done my research here..

306
00:18:26,915 --> 00:18:28,355
..and written a story
about this place.

307
00:18:28,435 --> 00:18:30,355
My friend,
I've told you many times..

308
00:18:30,435 --> 00:18:32,315
..I've no interest
in hearing your story.

309
00:18:32,395 --> 00:18:34,195
Sir, but I am interested
in telling you.

310
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:36,595
FIMFARE, ZEE, IIFA, TOIFA,

311
00:18:36,675 --> 00:18:38,235
Even the Lion's club
award will be yours sir.

312
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,915
Thank you very much for the awards.

313
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:42,515
But dude, I don't
want to hear your story.

314
00:18:42,643 --> 00:18:44,995
Because I've got my own
story for my first film.

315
00:18:45,075 --> 00:18:46,315
Hold on, sir.

316
00:18:47,435 --> 00:18:48,984
You wrote a story without me.

317
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:52,035
Without me?

318
00:18:52,502 --> 00:18:53,435
Sorry.

319
00:18:53,475 --> 00:18:54,595
Sir, just joking.

320
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,995
By the way, what's the genre?

321
00:18:56,075 --> 00:18:57,635
I mean what kind of a film is it?

322
00:18:57,675 --> 00:18:59,555
Action? Social? Thriller? Horror?

323
00:18:59,595 --> 00:19:00,955
Or one of those
intellectual art films..

324
00:19:01,035 --> 00:19:02,635
..with a strong message.

325
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:03,835
It's not like that.

326
00:19:03,955 --> 00:19:06,275
But what do you know about these
intellectual art-house movies?

327
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,355
Sir, I may look like a tramp..

328
00:19:08,435 --> 00:19:10,275
..but tramp only get the triumph.

329
00:19:10,475 --> 00:19:12,803
By the way, I am MA in Literature
from Allahabad University.

330
00:19:12,996 --> 00:19:14,676
And member of the
Cineclub in Allahabad.

331
00:19:15,194 --> 00:19:17,035
Fellini, Truffaut, Bergman..

332
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,715
..and our very own Satyajit Ray,
Gurudutt, Shantaram..

333
00:19:21,771 --> 00:19:22,964
..made such great films.

334
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:24,915
I guess you're a big movie buff.

335
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,090
Very big sir.

336
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:27,289
Big one?

337
00:19:27,512 --> 00:19:29,235
Okay, how about the
contemporary film-makers?

338
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:31,803
Danny Boyle, Ang Lee,
Christopher Nolan..

339
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:32,911
..have you seen their work?

340
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:34,071
Just tell me the movie name, sir..

341
00:19:34,111 --> 00:19:35,831
..I can tell you the entire
screenplay, with dialogues.

342
00:19:35,951 --> 00:19:36,991
No, let it be.

343
00:19:37,071 --> 00:19:38,271
Sir. Can I say something?

344
00:19:38,391 --> 00:19:41,231
Stop making these ad-films.
- Why is that?

345
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:43,871
If a young talent like you do
the slavery to this consumerism.

346
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:45,751
And sell these soaps and
toothpaste, doesn't look nice.

347
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:47,871
Make a feature film.

348
00:19:47,951 --> 00:19:49,511
And say whatever you want.

349
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,422
Sir, there's great fun in
making a feature film, sir.

350
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:53,911
But you just mentioned Satyajit Ray.
- Yes, sir.

351
00:19:53,991 --> 00:19:55,871
Even he made ad-films first.

352
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:58,111
And if we don't sell
these soaps and toothpaste..

353
00:19:58,151 --> 00:19:59,551
..then what will we eat?

354
00:19:59,711 --> 00:20:02,231
And anyway, who will
finance my independent film?

355
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,951
Corporates are only interested
in the number game and stars.

356
00:20:05,031 --> 00:20:06,351
That's true, sir.

357
00:20:06,511 --> 00:20:08,671
But, are you interested
in making a feature film?

358
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,311
Definitely.

359
00:20:10,551 --> 00:20:12,391
In fact, I also have
a story in my mind.

360
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:13,911
Hot Haryanvi.

361
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:16,391
And for that I'm
also meeting a producer.

362
00:20:16,671 --> 00:20:18,231
Well, you didn't hear my story..

363
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:20,101
..but I will definitely
hear your story.

364
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:23,231
Don't worry, I won't leak it out.

365
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:25,111
I can also sign an NDA for you.

366
00:20:25,231 --> 00:20:26,751
Non Disclosure Agreement.

367
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:35,635
So the basic story is about a boy..

368
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,151
..who plays in a band.

369
00:20:37,191 --> 00:20:38,281
Marriage band?

370
00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:40,229
No.

371
00:20:40,537 --> 00:20:41,701
Music band. Musical group.

372
00:20:41,804 --> 00:20:43,395
I see. Like beetles, etcetera.

373
00:20:43,524 --> 00:20:44,524
Something like that.

374
00:20:44,574 --> 00:20:46,869
But they only play Haryanvi music.
- Oh!

375
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:48,669
Haryanvi music?

376
00:20:49,389 --> 00:20:51,149
Hard to digest,
but sounds interesting.

377
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:52,589
Next, sir. Next.

378
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,029
The parents of this boy..

379
00:20:54,109 --> 00:20:58,109
..want to fulfill
their dreams through him.

380
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:01,389
They want their son
to become a musician.

381
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:02,909
But the son knows..

382
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:05,749
..he can never fulfill
his parent's dreams.

383
00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:07,549
Because he's a bad musician.

384
00:21:07,665 --> 00:21:10,015
He doesn't have the
talent to compose songs.

385
00:21:10,568 --> 00:21:11,568
He is out of tune.

386
00:21:11,629 --> 00:21:14,559
He's stuck in a
strange non-creative limbo.

387
00:21:14,949 --> 00:21:16,987
He also has a girlfriend
who loves him.

388
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:19,956
But the boy hates
love and affection.

389
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:22,629
Same old wine in a new bottle.

390
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:24,429
You said something?
- No, sir. Nothing.

391
00:21:24,469 --> 00:21:26,509
Sir, what happens in the end?

392
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:28,149
That's the problem.

393
00:21:28,749 --> 00:21:31,024
I just can't figure out
what the end should be.

394
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:35,154
I have characters,
plot points, crises..

395
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:37,949
..cinematic moments,
but I can't think of..

396
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:39,709
..what the resolution should be.

397
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:41,869
The problem is by tomorrow..

398
00:21:41,949 --> 00:21:44,137
..I've to work out
the end at any cost.

399
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:47,389
Sir, if you don't mind
can I say something?

400
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:48,269
No, go ahead.

401
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:50,686
Sir, throw your
story in the dustbin.

402
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:53,269
What?

403
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:54,804
Sir, your story's got no impact.

404
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:58,629
This was just the synopsis.

405
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:01,269
When I tell you scene by scene
you'll realize the real impact.

406
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:03,909
Sir Raju writer is my name.
Writing is my job.

407
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:05,189
By hearing 2 minutes of the story..

408
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:07,749
I can imagine the entire screenplay
and know what's going to happen next.

409
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:09,389
Really?
- Sir, you felt bad.

410
00:22:09,469 --> 00:22:11,069
No, sir. - That's why
you're leaving me in the middle.

411
00:22:11,149 --> 00:22:12,069
I didn't feel bad,

412
00:22:12,109 --> 00:22:13,629
Sir, I heard your boring story..

413
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,473
..so you got to hear
my interesting story.

414
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,269
You mean your story's
better than mine.

415
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:23,469
Sir, don't try to
compare a diamond with a stone.

416
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:25,549
I see.
- Yes, sir.

417
00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:27,949
If you make a film on my story..
- I know, I know.

418
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:30,069
Filmfare,
Screen, Zee, IIFA, TOIFA..

419
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,469
..we'll even bag
the Lions Club award.

420
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:32,780
Right?
- Yes, sir.

421
00:22:33,714 --> 00:22:36,509
What are you?
- The best, sir.

422
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:40,749
Fine, you win I lose.

423
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:42,429
Sir, I love you.
- What are you doing?

424
00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:43,879
I love you.
- Stay away.

425
00:22:44,334 --> 00:22:45,349
Come on, tell me your story.

426
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,530
Okay, sir.

427
00:22:46,572 --> 00:22:49,349
So, we begin our
story from a smoke.

428
00:22:49,697 --> 00:22:50,697
Smoke?
- Yes.

429
00:22:50,751 --> 00:22:53,069
Sir, the signing.
- Oh, you want money already.

430
00:22:53,219 --> 00:22:54,549
Sir, cigarette.

431
00:22:55,897 --> 00:22:56,704
Yes.

432
00:22:56,744 --> 00:22:58,475
Here you go.
- Yes, sir.

433
00:22:58,975 --> 00:23:01,109
Now light it.

434
00:23:02,037 --> 00:23:03,229
Take a puff.

435
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,149
There'll be smoke all around.

436
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,829
And with the smoke
the story starts.

437
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:13,189
Sir, the old mills and buildings..

438
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:15,349
..are disappearing from the city.

439
00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:17,949
From the mills between
Lower Parel and Mahalaxmi..

440
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:20,256
..to the old house
between Bandra and Colaba..

441
00:23:20,296 --> 00:23:22,549
..were devoured by the
wind of development.

442
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,709
From British rule to Indian rule.

443
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:27,109
And now it feels like we're
living in the promoter's rule.

444
00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:28,989
Old structures are
being razed down..

445
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:30,789
..to build 7 star hotels.

446
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:32,429
New condominiums are
being built every day.

447
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:34,589
Multiplexes, shopping malls.

448
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,029
By the grace of God..

449
00:23:36,236 --> 00:23:37,869
..and some new Municipal rules..

450
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:40,549
..heritage and disputed
properties are still intact.

451
00:23:40,829 --> 00:23:42,389
But they are few in numbers.

452
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:44,189
The question is..

453
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:46,869
..who's most bothered by
the city's development?

454
00:23:46,949 --> 00:23:47,949
Mumbaikars.

455
00:23:48,069 --> 00:23:50,229
I mean, all this is
forcing a common Mumbaikar..

456
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:51,989
..to leave the city and go out.

457
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:53,389
No, sir.
That problem was always there..

458
00:23:53,469 --> 00:23:54,909
..and it will always be there.

459
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,494
But the demolition
of mills and houses..

460
00:23:57,949 --> 00:23:59,589
..has put Mumbai's
spirit in danger.

461
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:00,709
Spirit?

462
00:24:00,846 --> 00:24:03,269
Oh, I see. You mean the Mumbai spirit?
- No, sir.

463
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:04,389
Not that spirit.

464
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:06,757
By spirit I mean ghosts, souls.

465
00:24:08,869 --> 00:24:09,869
Dead people.

466
00:24:14,629 --> 00:24:16,269
Sir, they're in a terrible state.

467
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,109
They are ruined.

468
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:20,189
These old houses and mills..

469
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:21,709
..used to be their den.

470
00:24:22,267 --> 00:24:24,029
You can also call it
their dwelling place.

471
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:27,069
And now those simple,
nave ghosts..

472
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:29,189
..are facing a big crises.

473
00:24:29,682 --> 00:24:31,598
They are wandering from
one place to another..

474
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:32,989
..like crazy homeless souls.

475
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:36,029
And the few homes that are left
are not enough for all of them.

476
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:38,028
Because their population is more
than the number of homes.

477
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:40,109
And sir, the worst part is..

478
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:41,909
..no one's paying
attention to the ghost community..

479
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:43,509
..during their time of crises.

480
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:45,909
The government isn't
introducing any scheme..

481
00:24:45,949 --> 00:24:47,509
..to resettle them.

482
00:24:47,749 --> 00:24:50,589
No one's starting any movement.

483
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,149
Ruling party, opposition party,
civil societies..

484
00:24:53,229 --> 00:24:55,589
..and even the media
isn't ready to help them..

485
00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:57,469
Because their viewership
doesn't depend on ghosts.

486
00:24:57,613 --> 00:24:58,909
Exactly, sir. You're on the mark.

487
00:24:59,044 --> 00:25:01,229
Because they are
neither consumers nor voters.

488
00:25:01,656 --> 00:25:02,656
Very good.

489
00:25:03,123 --> 00:25:05,587
I can sense political
satire in your story.

490
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:08,281
But there shouldn't be any
lecture or long speeches..

491
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:10,561
..to deliver a social message.

492
00:25:10,641 --> 00:25:12,041
I like films which has layers.

493
00:25:12,081 --> 00:25:13,321
Something that has ups and downs.

494
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:15,001
Sir, you'll find
layers after layers..

495
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:16,681
..in Raju Writer's story.

496
00:25:16,721 --> 00:25:18,521
With all commercial ingredients.

497
00:25:18,624 --> 00:25:21,321
Crime, passion, thrill, music,
romance, dance.

498
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:22,801
After all, these things make..

499
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:25,521
..a great Indian pot boiler.

500
00:25:26,521 --> 00:25:27,681
Fine, let's listen.

501
00:25:27,982 --> 00:25:30,241
We'll start our story
with the character of..

502
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,521
..Raibahadur Mr. Gendamal Hemraj.

503
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:35,241
Isn't he the same person
Hemant was talking about?

504
00:25:35,321 --> 00:25:38,521
Yes, sir. In return of
selling his mills to the British..

505
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:41,081
..he got the title of
Raibahardur from the British.

506
00:25:41,161 --> 00:25:44,001
And on that occasion, there's
a celebration in the mansion.

507
00:25:44,321 --> 00:25:45,321
Cheers!

508
00:25:45,841 --> 00:25:47,081
Cheers!

509
00:25:50,241 --> 00:25:52,201
On one side there
were celebrations..

510
00:25:52,321 --> 00:25:54,841
..and on the other,
the mill workers..

511
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:56,601
..were fuming with hatred.

512
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:58,574
Right after taking over the mills..

513
00:25:58,614 --> 00:26:00,681
..the Britishers cut
down their salary and wages.

514
00:26:00,841 --> 00:26:01,961
And the Mill Worker Unions..

515
00:26:02,223 --> 00:26:03,921
..staged a strike
against this cruelty.

516
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:05,921
Gendamal was supporting
the Britishers..

517
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:08,561
..and wasn't ready to bow before
the demands of the workers.

518
00:26:08,641 --> 00:26:09,961
Down with..
- Gendamal!

519
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:11,481
Down with..
- Gendamal!

520
00:26:11,561 --> 00:26:12,585
Down with..
- Gendamal!

521
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:17,241
The workers were gripped
with starvation and sickness.

522
00:26:17,698 --> 00:26:21,315
And in a fit of rage they
burnt the mill down to ashes.

523
00:26:25,361 --> 00:26:26,561
Save me!

524
00:26:32,739 --> 00:26:35,601
After his death,
Raibahadur Gendamal..

525
00:26:35,921 --> 00:26:38,041
..decided to stay in this mansion..

526
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:40,361
..instead of wandering in the mill.

527
00:26:46,801 --> 00:26:50,481
Sir, other than the Royal mansion
there was another mansion in the city.

528
00:26:50,561 --> 00:26:51,641
Imperial Palace.

529
00:26:51,681 --> 00:26:53,921
Before India got freedom..

530
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:56,281
..the Governor
General Ramsay lived in it.

531
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,561
Indian revolutionaries were..

532
00:26:58,641 --> 00:26:59,961
..thirsty for British blood.

533
00:27:00,081 --> 00:27:03,881
And one day they attacked
Ramsay sir when he was alone.

534
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:05,561
Vande Mataram!

535
00:27:07,521 --> 00:27:09,681
And before India achieved freedom..

536
00:27:09,841 --> 00:27:12,721
..Ramsay's soul was
liberated from his body.

537
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:16,513
Ramsay's ghost resided
comfortably in the Imperial Palace.

538
00:27:16,721 --> 00:27:18,761
But this luxury lasted
only for a few days.

539
00:27:18,978 --> 00:27:20,321
Because right after
the independence..

540
00:27:20,401 --> 00:27:21,848
..the Indian
government sanctioned an order..

541
00:27:21,888 --> 00:27:23,401
..to convert that
place into a library.

542
00:27:23,803 --> 00:27:26,081
Now Ramsay liked to read books.

543
00:27:26,214 --> 00:27:29,961
But his ghost detested books,
magazines and newspapers.

544
00:27:30,247 --> 00:27:32,681
So Ramsay was in a dilemma.

545
00:27:32,961 --> 00:27:34,201
Mr. Booth!

546
00:27:34,856 --> 00:27:36,321
Mr. Booth!

547
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,081
And he met his
once-upon-a-time boss, Mr. Booth..

548
00:27:41,281 --> 00:27:43,481
..and made him call Gendamal..

549
00:27:43,627 --> 00:27:46,641
..and get him a place
in the Royal mansion.

550
00:27:47,092 --> 00:27:48,601
I've a friend, Ramsay.

551
00:27:48,729 --> 00:27:50,161
He just passed away.

552
00:27:50,297 --> 00:27:51,660
I need a place for him.

553
00:27:54,645 --> 00:27:57,061
Excuse me, are you Raibahadur?

554
00:27:57,101 --> 00:27:58,281
Depends who's asking?

555
00:27:58,603 --> 00:28:00,603
I am Governor general Ramsay.

556
00:28:01,803 --> 00:28:03,323
You are Governor general Ramsay.

557
00:28:03,403 --> 00:28:05,589
Than I am Raibahadur
Gendamal Hemraj.

558
00:28:06,403 --> 00:28:08,883
Mr. Booth has
recommended your name.

559
00:28:08,963 --> 00:28:11,803
No, Mr. Booth
recommended me your name.

560
00:28:11,883 --> 00:28:12,963
He was a nice man.

561
00:28:13,003 --> 00:28:14,723
He used to called me
Genda affectionately.

562
00:28:14,883 --> 00:28:15,983
Genda?

563
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:17,443
As in hippopotamus?

564
00:28:17,483 --> 00:28:19,363
No, no, that's Gainda
Da this is Gentha-tha

565
00:28:19,483 --> 00:28:22,683
This is not the same.
- Oh, Ganda, meaning dirty.

566
00:28:22,723 --> 00:28:26,258
No, it means flower...marigold.

567
00:28:26,298 --> 00:28:28,643
Marigold. A lovely name.

568
00:28:28,683 --> 00:28:30,043
Shall we go inside?
- No.

569
00:28:30,123 --> 00:28:31,283
We will not go inside.

570
00:28:31,323 --> 00:28:32,363
Who is the boss? I am the boss.

571
00:28:32,403 --> 00:28:33,406
Who is the boss?
- You're the boss.

572
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:35,285
Yes. So you will not go inside.

573
00:28:35,556 --> 00:28:37,283
I will ask you to come inside.

574
00:28:37,363 --> 00:28:38,523
Please come inside.

575
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:39,895
May I sir?
- Yes.

576
00:28:44,603 --> 00:28:46,163
And now we come to the 50's.

577
00:28:46,803 --> 00:28:49,698
Gendamal's younger brother,
Gulabchand Hemraj.

578
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,002
Hemraj family's most useless son.

579
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,923
Alcohol, women, gambling, race.

580
00:28:54,003 --> 00:28:56,363
You can say he had every
bad habit in the world.

581
00:28:56,523 --> 00:28:57,843
Complete Casanova.

582
00:28:57,923 --> 00:28:59,843
Those days he was
madly in love with..

583
00:28:59,883 --> 00:29:02,003
..the famous singer
Manoranjana Kumari..

584
00:29:02,203 --> 00:29:05,003
..of those days, and also invested
lots of money in her films.

585
00:29:05,123 --> 00:29:06,883
Manoranjana Kumari?
- Yes.

586
00:29:07,243 --> 00:29:08,603
She always said.

587
00:29:08,923 --> 00:29:10,403
Entertainment.
Entertainment.

588
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:13,283
And only entertainment
is what makes a film successful.

589
00:29:13,643 --> 00:29:18,083
Entertaining the director, producer
and actor behind the scenes.

590
00:29:18,203 --> 00:29:19,723
And she wouldn't waste a moment..

591
00:29:19,803 --> 00:29:23,963
..entertaining anyone she liked,
Manoranjana Kumari.

592
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:47,363
""I won't give it.""

593
00:29:47,723 --> 00:29:51,363
""I won't give it.""

594
00:29:51,803 --> 00:29:55,393
""I won't give my heart for free.""

595
00:29:55,563 --> 00:29:59,363
""I won't give my heart for free.""

596
00:30:16,242 --> 00:30:19,603
""Trying to cajole me.""

597
00:30:20,388 --> 00:30:23,723
""But first check your pockets.""

598
00:30:28,483 --> 00:30:31,997
""Trying to cajole me.""

599
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:36,083
""But first check your pockets.""

600
00:30:36,683 --> 00:30:40,265
""Check your bank balance first.""

601
00:30:40,796 --> 00:30:44,043
""And then say I love you.""

602
00:30:44,202 --> 00:30:48,169
""O beloved, if you don't pay..""

603
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:52,004
""..the taxes for this service,
you won't get anything.""

604
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:54,523
""I won't give it.""

605
00:30:54,977 --> 00:30:56,603
""I won't give it.""

606
00:30:56,748 --> 00:30:58,523
""I won't give it.""

607
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,443
""I won't give it for free.""

608
00:31:01,163 --> 00:31:04,685
""I won't give it.""

609
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:08,833
""I won't give my heart for free.""

610
00:31:09,286 --> 00:31:12,923
""I won't give it.""

611
00:31:13,384 --> 00:31:16,921
""I won't give it.""

612
00:31:17,127 --> 00:31:24,347
""I won't give my heart for free.""

613
00:31:24,793 --> 00:31:27,163
""I won't give my heart for free.""

614
00:31:27,528 --> 00:31:29,643
I am not asking your
heart for free, Manoranjana.

615
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,563
Did I give you these earrings,
the necklace for free?

616
00:31:32,818 --> 00:31:34,385
Don't they have a value?

617
00:31:34,528 --> 00:31:36,043
Don't they have a price?

618
00:31:36,617 --> 00:31:40,563
And I've also transferred the
property papers in your name.

619
00:31:41,196 --> 00:31:43,403
I don't want your property.

620
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,603
All I want is a
pinch of vermillion..

621
00:31:45,896 --> 00:31:47,203
..to grace my forehead.

622
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:48,506
Foolish!

623
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:51,455
I am ready to squander all
my wealth at your bellow.

624
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:55,949
And all you demand is
a pinch of vermillion.

625
00:31:56,798 --> 00:31:59,403
Yes. Make me your wife.

626
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,163
And give me some place
in your heart.

627
00:32:02,843 --> 00:32:06,443
Manoranjana is tired
of entertaining people.

628
00:32:06,838 --> 00:32:08,763
Take it easy my nightingale.

629
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,630
I love you.

630
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,590
And I swear I will take
the nuptial rounds with you..

631
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,870
...and marry you ASAP, darling.

632
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:21,122
Thank you.
- Mention not.

633
00:32:21,245 --> 00:32:24,190
Don't forget me, I beg of you.

634
00:32:24,264 --> 00:32:26,790
Will give you, will
also give you the bag

635
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,190
Gulab didn't keep his promise.

636
00:32:29,971 --> 00:32:31,390
And Manoranjana's age..

637
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,674
..put a full stop
on her movie career.

638
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:36,710
And then one day
she found out, that..

639
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,430
..Gulab got married to a
famous industrialist's daughter.

640
00:32:41,434 --> 00:32:43,910
She couldn't endure
her shattered heart..

641
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,470
..and this terrible shock.

642
00:32:46,579 --> 00:32:50,567
And she took to the
famous filmy bottle SAD 69.

643
00:32:51,891 --> 00:32:54,881
And one day, after
finishing 69 bottles..

644
00:32:55,661 --> 00:32:57,870
..under the influence of alcohol..

645
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:01,870
..she hung herself from the fan.

646
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,590
Oh no!

647
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:07,230
Manoranjana's soul
decided to take refuge..

648
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,876
..in the same mansion, where she..

649
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:11,990
..had dreamt of entering
as the daughter-in-law.

650
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:37,270
""My breath severed
all ties with life.""

651
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:45,390
""My delicate heart
shattered like glass.""

652
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:53,830
""My heart slowly burns like ember.""

653
00:33:56,246 --> 00:34:02,270
""My delicate heart
shattered like glass.""

654
00:34:04,415 --> 00:34:10,990
""My delicate heart
shattered like glass.""

655
00:34:33,652 --> 00:34:38,870
""My heart slowly burns like ember.""

656
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:47,990
""A sigh comes out of my heart.""

657
00:34:50,348 --> 00:34:56,182
""My heart slowly burns like ember.""

658
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:04,430
""A sigh comes out of my heart.""

659
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:12,590
""I've lost everything.""

660
00:35:15,266 --> 00:35:20,910
""My delicate heart
shattered like glass.""

661
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,270
Sir.

662
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,990
Please turn off the lights.

663
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,870
Your story is very nice.

664
00:35:45,146 --> 00:35:46,830
I mean it's superb.
- Thank you, sir.

665
00:35:47,031 --> 00:35:50,830
But...the production
designing will be really difficult.

666
00:35:52,094 --> 00:35:53,346
Different periods.

667
00:35:53,572 --> 00:35:55,810
The properties. Costumes.

668
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:56,959
Furniture.

669
00:35:57,118 --> 00:35:59,490
We'll have to do
detailed research. - No, sir.

670
00:35:59,555 --> 00:36:01,990
We don't have to do so much
research in a ghost story.

671
00:36:03,897 --> 00:36:09,310
You know, I'll shoot
Ramsay's scenes in sepia mode.

672
00:36:09,629 --> 00:36:11,710
And Manoranjana Kumari's
scenes in black and white.

673
00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:14,310
Back projection, direct lighting.

674
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,990
Every character will
have dual shadow..

675
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,670
..cast on a hand-drawn
background of the sky.

676
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:21,470
We can play around with the sky.

677
00:36:21,877 --> 00:36:23,510
We can play around with grey-scale.

678
00:36:28,459 --> 00:36:29,459
Thank you, sir.

679
00:36:30,865 --> 00:36:33,710
You gave such a good
reaction on a struggler's story.

680
00:36:34,308 --> 00:36:35,710
No one does that, sir.

681
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,510
I am touched, sir.

682
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,590
I am honored.

683
00:36:40,754 --> 00:36:42,910
Thank you, sir.
- Control yourself.

684
00:36:49,224 --> 00:36:50,510
Now we cut to the 70's.

685
00:36:51,153 --> 00:36:52,153
Bombay.

686
00:36:53,454 --> 00:36:54,510
Time of the underworld.

687
00:36:57,617 --> 00:36:59,350
After Gendamal's
death when Gulabchand..

688
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,634
..tried to take
over GH mills, then..

689
00:37:01,897 --> 00:37:03,510
..Gulabchand uncle, Heerachand..

690
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:07,830
..tipped famous gangster
Salim Fatela to kill Gulabchand.

691
00:37:08,124 --> 00:37:09,510
Coincidentally Salim Fatela..

692
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,190
..was also a big fan
of Manoranjana Kumari.

693
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,950
""I won't give it.""

694
00:37:17,799 --> 00:37:20,456
Gulabchand's ghost wanted to
live in Royal mansion too..

695
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:23,790
..and apologizes
to Manoranjana Kumari.

696
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:25,630
I am sorry, Manoranjana.

697
00:37:26,124 --> 00:37:27,570
I made a big mistake.

698
00:37:27,841 --> 00:37:28,891
Forgive me.

699
00:37:29,034 --> 00:37:32,237
And give me what you
always did when you were alive.

700
00:37:32,394 --> 00:37:34,910
What?
- Your love, Manoranjana.

701
00:37:35,655 --> 00:37:38,200
Don't have dirty
picture in your mind.

702
00:37:39,499 --> 00:37:41,019
Rascal, useless.

703
00:37:41,116 --> 00:37:42,878
You came back like a useless coin.

704
00:37:42,984 --> 00:37:45,082
Get out of here.
Manoranjana, go inside.

705
00:37:45,122 --> 00:37:46,933
Sorry, bro.
- Get out. Come on, out.

706
00:37:47,077 --> 00:37:48,855
Out!
- I am sorry. I am sorry.

707
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:51,579
Funny. Very funny. Too funny.

708
00:37:51,775 --> 00:37:52,775
Right, sir.

709
00:37:53,175 --> 00:37:55,415
And very exciting too.
- Right?

710
00:37:55,735 --> 00:37:59,575
I'll shoot this killing
portion with a hand-reel camera.

711
00:37:59,884 --> 00:38:00,754
Like RGV.

712
00:38:00,794 --> 00:38:01,794
Sir, RGV?

713
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:04,495
Ram Gopal Verma.
- Oh yeah, of course.

714
00:38:04,575 --> 00:38:05,535
Sir, I suggest that..

715
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,420
..you let him shoot
the killing scenes.

716
00:38:07,815 --> 00:38:08,981
Why not?

717
00:38:09,478 --> 00:38:10,935
Actually, he's my guru, you know.
- I see.

718
00:38:10,975 --> 00:38:11,975
Yes.

719
00:38:12,452 --> 00:38:13,455
I've assisted him.

720
00:38:13,495 --> 00:38:15,175
I've written dialogues for him.

721
00:38:15,655 --> 00:38:17,255
And I even operated
the camera in one film.

722
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,514
What are you saying?
- 5D.

723
00:38:18,975 --> 00:38:20,175
Sometimes under the table.

724
00:38:20,255 --> 00:38:21,712
Sometimes under the actor's face.

725
00:38:21,835 --> 00:38:23,367
And sometimes above
the fan's blade..

726
00:38:23,407 --> 00:38:26,175
..and many other places.

727
00:38:26,335 --> 00:38:27,653
Superb, sir.

728
00:38:28,095 --> 00:38:30,375
This project is
getting very interesting.

729
00:38:30,415 --> 00:38:31,217
Thank you, sir.

730
00:38:31,257 --> 00:38:32,415
All the characters aren't just..

731
00:38:32,495 --> 00:38:34,375
..from different
socio-economic backgrounds..

732
00:38:34,455 --> 00:38:36,188
..in fact, they're from
different time-period as well.

733
00:38:36,228 --> 00:38:37,037
Thank you, sir.

734
00:38:37,077 --> 00:38:39,335
And this movie will have
an amazing ensemble cast.

735
00:38:39,415 --> 00:38:39,907
Thank you, sir.

736
00:38:39,947 --> 00:38:41,257
And these days there's
an award for this as well.

737
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,330
Yes, sir.

738
00:38:42,615 --> 00:38:43,815
Bro, continue.

739
00:38:44,335 --> 00:38:46,655
Many of the old
haunted houses in Mumbai..

740
00:38:46,695 --> 00:38:49,015
..were being razed down in
the name of development.

741
00:38:49,295 --> 00:38:50,775
And the ghosts living in them..

742
00:38:50,815 --> 00:38:52,502
..decided to make
Gendamal's mansion..

743
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:55,135
..their permanent
address and came to them.

744
00:38:55,615 --> 00:38:58,135
But it was getting
difficult for Gendamal..

745
00:38:58,215 --> 00:39:01,055
..to adjust and
accommodate everyone.

746
00:39:01,135 --> 00:39:04,055
So how did the ghosts
accommodation problem get solved?

747
00:39:04,215 --> 00:39:06,695
Sir, an interview board was formed.

748
00:39:08,135 --> 00:39:10,055
This is very loud, get it repaired.

749
00:39:10,095 --> 00:39:11,935
And not just from Mumbai, but..

750
00:39:12,015 --> 00:39:14,175
..ghosts from the
different parts of the country..

751
00:39:14,335 --> 00:39:16,641
..in fact, even from outside the
country came from the interview.

752
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,655
Don't bend so much.

753
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:22,095
Otherwise you'll hit your
head on the ground and break it.

754
00:39:22,175 --> 00:39:23,575
There's gas filled in your head.

755
00:39:23,615 --> 00:39:26,714
Take this pill and go.

756
00:39:29,892 --> 00:39:33,812
Mister, the leaf that you chew
is called a 'Paan' (betel-leaf).

757
00:39:34,012 --> 00:39:36,028
And my name's Akbar Khwaza Khan..

758
00:39:36,068 --> 00:39:38,804
alias Natwar Khawaza Khan
alias Khatwar Khwaza Khan.

759
00:39:39,092 --> 00:39:41,452
That's fine, but which one's
out of these three is your name?

760
00:39:41,541 --> 00:39:43,692
Gentleman, the person's
name is Akbar Khwaza Khan.

761
00:39:43,772 --> 00:39:44,852
And what's your name?

762
00:39:44,932 --> 00:39:46,452
I am Akbar Khwaza Khan.

763
00:39:46,612 --> 00:39:48,492
Then what is person's name?

764
00:39:48,612 --> 00:39:49,892
Gentleman, this is Urdu dialect.

765
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:51,932
There's just me, there's no us.

766
00:39:52,012 --> 00:39:52,696
Oh you mean.

767
00:39:52,736 --> 00:39:55,132
You are my mother and you are my
father.. you are my friend too.

768
00:39:55,212 --> 00:39:56,922
It's an old Hindi film from
know you will not understand..

769
00:39:56,962 --> 00:39:58,348
..but nothing to worry.
- Continue

770
00:39:58,502 --> 00:40:00,532
In Continue We're Pindari's,
mister.

771
00:40:00,612 --> 00:40:02,012
Muslim-Maratha are brothers.

772
00:40:02,092 --> 00:40:03,652
We fought the battle of Mahirpur.

773
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,372
Warrior.
- Warrior Akbar.

774
00:40:06,452 --> 00:40:07,852
Jodha-Akbar!

775
00:40:08,012 --> 00:40:09,972
You movie buff.

776
00:40:10,332 --> 00:40:12,172
Not Jodha-Akbar! Warrior Akbar.

777
00:40:12,252 --> 00:40:13,332
Talk with respect.

778
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:14,052
Continue.

779
00:40:14,092 --> 00:40:17,692
Well, I was king of Indore's
Malhar Holkar's special chef.

780
00:40:17,772 --> 00:40:19,372
How did you become a ghost?

781
00:40:19,532 --> 00:40:21,732
Mister,
during the war of Mahirpur..

782
00:40:21,772 --> 00:40:24,132
..I tried to make
a hole in kitchen..

783
00:40:24,212 --> 00:40:26,932
..and keep an eye on
the enemy for the king.

784
00:40:27,372 --> 00:40:29,012
But I didn't know that the enemy..

785
00:40:29,092 --> 00:40:31,172
..already made a
hole in the back wall..

786
00:40:31,252 --> 00:40:33,812
..and have their guns aimed..

787
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:35,532
..at the kind's special chef.

788
00:40:35,612 --> 00:40:37,467
On the whole what happened?

789
00:40:37,772 --> 00:40:41,772
On the whole the enemy
filled my whole body with holes..

790
00:40:41,892 --> 00:40:44,812
..that I didn't know
where do I breathe from..

791
00:40:44,972 --> 00:40:46,572
..and from where do I..

792
00:40:46,772 --> 00:40:49,932
Mister, that's why I
hate these Britishers.

793
00:40:50,252 --> 00:40:52,052
Is he talking about me?
- Yes.

794
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:53,292
He says he likes you.

795
00:40:53,332 --> 00:40:54,332
Oh, hello.

796
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:57,692
Mister, the kitchen
where I used to live.

797
00:40:58,034 --> 00:40:59,972
Now someone's opened
a tea-stall there.

798
00:41:00,052 --> 00:41:01,532
And now I am kitchen-less.

799
00:41:03,692 --> 00:41:07,292
Let's appoint him for
making non-veg food.

800
00:41:07,452 --> 00:41:08,492
Select.

801
00:41:09,372 --> 00:41:10,012
Selected.

802
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:11,100
My name's PK.

803
00:41:11,294 --> 00:41:13,020
I was a film producer in Mumbai.

804
00:41:13,412 --> 00:41:17,092
You might know that a film
producer's life...is really bad.

805
00:41:17,332 --> 00:41:19,132
First run after the
director for the script.

806
00:41:19,212 --> 00:41:20,892
Then run after the hero for dates.

807
00:41:20,972 --> 00:41:23,094
Then run after the
heroine to dress her up fully.

808
00:41:23,212 --> 00:41:24,845
You get so good at running..

809
00:41:24,885 --> 00:41:26,959
..that, if you make the
producer run in the Olympics..

810
00:41:26,999 --> 00:41:28,332
..then he'll
definitely win a gold medal.

811
00:41:28,372 --> 00:41:30,892
Sir. Why does he use
that word when he speaks?

812
00:41:30,932 --> 00:41:32,972
Because the rascal does
not deserve to be here.

813
00:41:33,012 --> 00:41:33,932
Out!

814
00:41:33,972 --> 00:41:35,452
Reject him.
- Why, sir?

815
00:41:35,532 --> 00:41:36,332
Rejected.

816
00:41:36,372 --> 00:41:38,132
What did you do, rascal?
- Sorry, sir.

817
00:41:38,212 --> 00:41:39,812
Hello, sir.
I am Bhootnath Bhaduri.

818
00:41:39,892 --> 00:41:40,932
Bhoot..
- Yes.

819
00:41:41,012 --> 00:41:44,252
Before the partition I
lived in East Bengal.

820
00:41:44,372 --> 00:41:46,532
Back there I was a
compounder with the doctor.

821
00:41:46,612 --> 00:41:47,892
I used to give
medicines to the patients.

822
00:41:48,092 --> 00:41:51,012
And after the
partition I came to Bombay.

823
00:41:51,172 --> 00:41:52,732
Mumbai. Mumbai.

824
00:41:52,812 --> 00:41:54,812
You're so stupid, brother.

825
00:41:54,852 --> 00:41:56,372
There was no Mumbai back then.

826
00:41:56,452 --> 00:41:58,092
It was just Bombay back then.

827
00:41:58,172 --> 00:41:59,412
So I came to Bombay..

828
00:41:59,492 --> 00:42:01,692
..and started living
close to the railway tracks.

829
00:42:01,772 --> 00:42:03,052
It was nice. It was nice.

830
00:42:03,132 --> 00:42:05,612
But my life had become terrible.

831
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:07,532
Every day the train pass-by..

832
00:42:07,612 --> 00:42:11,932
..making the clacking sounds.

833
00:42:12,252 --> 00:42:15,772
One day a train passed
too close to my ears.

834
00:42:15,852 --> 00:42:16,932
I didn't realize.

835
00:42:17,012 --> 00:42:19,892
But then someone said
""Bengali man passed away"".

836
00:42:19,972 --> 00:42:22,372
That's when I realized
that I am dead.

837
00:42:22,612 --> 00:42:24,692
So after that I
started living on a tree.

838
00:42:24,883 --> 00:42:26,723
Then one day few people
came and said..

839
00:42:26,763 --> 00:42:28,612
..we'll make a highway here,
four-lane highway.

840
00:42:28,692 --> 00:42:30,972
And they cut down the tree.
I lost my home.

841
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:34,132
After that I searched for a home..

842
00:42:34,172 --> 00:42:36,732
..but, I couldn't find a
single home in Mumbai.

843
00:42:36,812 --> 00:42:38,252
Bombay. Bombay.

844
00:42:38,692 --> 00:42:41,012
He's very stupid.

845
00:42:41,783 --> 00:42:44,743
Now it's Mumbai, there's
no more Bombay anymore.

846
00:42:46,253 --> 00:42:49,212
You see, East Bengal
became Bangladesh.

847
00:42:49,292 --> 00:42:50,692
Bombay became Mumbai.

848
00:42:50,772 --> 00:42:52,132
Humans become devil.

849
00:42:52,212 --> 00:42:54,189
But I was a refugee
even before I died..

850
00:42:54,229 --> 00:42:55,972
..and I am a refugee
even after I am dead.

851
00:42:56,052 --> 00:42:57,172
Nothing happened to me.

852
00:42:58,252 --> 00:43:00,292
Your story is very touching.

853
00:43:01,132 --> 00:43:03,692
A Compounder that's bit
like a doctor Isn't it?

854
00:43:04,023 --> 00:43:05,012
I know better.

855
00:43:05,052 --> 00:43:07,892
After eating Khwaja
Khan's food we might need him.

856
00:43:08,097 --> 00:43:08,794
Okay.

857
00:43:08,834 --> 00:43:09,834
Accepted.

858
00:43:10,434 --> 00:43:11,434
Accepted.

859
00:43:11,842 --> 00:43:13,572
Thank you.
Thank you, brother.

860
00:43:13,732 --> 00:43:16,492
Try this medicine.

861
00:43:16,892 --> 00:43:18,412
Take it. Take it.
Take this pill.

862
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,732
Always works, brother.

863
00:43:23,377 --> 00:43:24,612
So fast?
- Yes.

864
00:43:25,856 --> 00:43:27,892
For the next
interview we'll go outdoors.

865
00:43:28,265 --> 00:43:29,211
Okay.

866
00:43:29,251 --> 00:43:30,251
Oh, God!

867
00:43:30,864 --> 00:43:33,052
It is still not working,
but this is working.

868
00:43:34,887 --> 00:43:35,887
Sir.

869
00:43:36,607 --> 00:43:37,652
I am sorry. I am sorry.

870
00:43:37,938 --> 00:43:38,972
I am sorry.

871
00:43:39,396 --> 00:43:41,292
Brigadier Hoshiyar
Singh from Hoshiyarpur..

872
00:43:41,332 --> 00:43:43,007
..winner of Dharamveer Chakra, sir.

873
00:43:43,145 --> 00:43:44,145
Sir!

874
00:43:44,203 --> 00:43:47,283
Sir, shall we talk and talk
and pass some gas too? - No.

875
00:43:47,363 --> 00:43:49,003
I mean pass some time, sir.
- Yes.

876
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:50,083
Sir.
- Sir.

877
00:43:50,323 --> 00:43:53,363
In the year of 1999, the enemy..

878
00:43:53,443 --> 00:43:55,963
..was showering bullets on us.

879
00:43:56,136 --> 00:44:00,723
We had reacquired many parts
of Drass and Batalik sector.

880
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:02,883
In the happiness of the victory..

881
00:44:02,963 --> 00:44:04,403
..our convoy was moving ahead..

882
00:44:04,483 --> 00:44:07,043
..singing 'Hindustan Hamara',
when suddenly.

883
00:44:07,549 --> 00:44:08,723
we were shelled.

884
00:44:08,883 --> 00:44:10,255
We were bombarded.

885
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:13,116
Sir...sir..

886
00:44:13,354 --> 00:44:15,763
I guess the enemy ghosts are
bombarding this place as well.

887
00:44:15,843 --> 00:44:16,963
We should be careful.
- Relax.

888
00:44:17,043 --> 00:44:19,523
We should..
- Relax, there's nobody here.

889
00:44:19,603 --> 00:44:21,243
It's just a passing phase.

890
00:44:21,323 --> 00:44:22,123
Passing.

891
00:44:22,163 --> 00:44:23,363
It's passed.

892
00:44:23,603 --> 00:44:25,123
I respect your opinion, sir.

893
00:44:25,203 --> 00:44:27,603
But an army man should
always be alert, sir.

894
00:44:27,683 --> 00:44:29,803
Why?
- We attained martyrdom.

895
00:44:29,963 --> 00:44:33,188
And even after we died the
government scammed our coffins.

896
00:44:33,228 --> 00:44:35,563
Why? Because we weren't alert.

897
00:44:35,643 --> 00:44:37,843
This is the perfect man
to maintain security..

898
00:44:37,923 --> 00:44:39,283
..for our mansion.
- Okay.

899
00:44:40,187 --> 00:44:41,710
Hoshiyar Singh.
- Yes sir.

900
00:44:42,167 --> 00:44:44,483
Situation and breeze, both
are quite worse. - I know, sir.

901
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:48,443
But you used your brains,
so I select you.

902
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:52,083
I am Aatmaram Paswan.

903
00:44:52,302 --> 00:44:53,523
No, you were.

904
00:44:54,206 --> 00:44:55,443
Better take the Ram and
Paswan out of your name.

905
00:44:55,523 --> 00:44:56,603
Now you're just Aatma (spirit).

906
00:44:56,758 --> 00:44:57,923
District was Darbhanga.

907
00:44:58,042 --> 00:44:59,203
No, it still is.

908
00:44:59,352 --> 00:45:01,083
You're dead, but
Darbhanga is still alive.

909
00:45:01,237 --> 00:45:03,392
What did you do?
- Sir, during the day..

910
00:45:03,432 --> 00:45:05,323
..I used to drive
the taxi in Mumbai.

911
00:45:05,403 --> 00:45:07,003
And sleep on the footpath at night.

912
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:09,643
One night,
just before the new year..

913
00:45:09,813 --> 00:45:11,603
..I was sleeping
covered in my blanket.

914
00:45:11,863 --> 00:45:15,283
Suddenly, a rich man,
who was very drunk..

915
00:45:15,363 --> 00:45:17,683
..drove his car onto the footpath.

916
00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:19,560
Exactly at the spot
where I was sleeping.

917
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,563
And right then Aatmaram's soul..

918
00:45:21,705 --> 00:45:23,911
..was liberated from
Aatmaram's body. Right?

919
00:45:24,025 --> 00:45:25,523
I don't know, sir.

920
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,963
I am a poor man.

921
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:29,203
I have an old model
car parked outside.

922
00:45:29,534 --> 00:45:31,523
Can you take me
to the beach in that?

923
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:33,102
I will take you
wherever you want, sir.

924
00:45:33,142 --> 00:45:34,763
Fine, fine. Yes, what do you say?

925
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:37,443
This driver does have some drive.
- Yes.

926
00:45:37,695 --> 00:45:38,695
Accept him.

927
00:45:38,749 --> 00:45:39,883
The whiteman said something.

928
00:45:40,073 --> 00:45:41,083
Selected.

929
00:45:41,263 --> 00:45:43,203
Myself Robin Hooda.

930
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,723
Robin Hood?
- Not Hood.

931
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,283
Hooda. From Rohtak, Haryana.

932
00:45:48,635 --> 00:45:49,635
Father was an engineer..

933
00:45:49,683 --> 00:45:51,203
..so, he wanted me
to be an engineer too.

934
00:45:51,412 --> 00:45:52,403
And mother was a doctor.

935
00:45:52,443 --> 00:45:54,003
She wanted to see me in
the operation theatre.

936
00:45:54,143 --> 00:45:55,963
But I was interested in
music since I was a kid.

937
00:45:56,043 --> 00:45:56,923
Rock music.

938
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:58,323
Dodes, Metallica.

939
00:45:58,776 --> 00:46:01,523
Anyway, I formed a band.
Also released an album.

940
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:03,203
We sold 13 CDs in the market.

941
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:04,163
That's all.

942
00:46:04,203 --> 00:46:06,283
Squandered lots of money,
also got humiliated.

943
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:07,563
And I also went into depression.

944
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,803
I couldn't write songs.
The writer in me was blocked.

945
00:46:10,044 --> 00:46:11,803
In frustration
I started taking drugs.

946
00:46:11,931 --> 00:46:15,163
Drugs you mean Aspro,
Anacin and Crocin.

947
00:46:15,386 --> 00:46:16,810
No. Marijuana, cannabis.

948
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:20,283
Earlier I took small doses.
Later I increased the dosage.

949
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,443
One day I injected excess heroine.

950
00:46:23,707 --> 00:46:25,015
When I came to my senses..

951
00:46:25,055 --> 00:46:27,483
..I realized that's Robin
Hooda lying on the ice-slab.

952
00:46:27,847 --> 00:46:30,123
My nose was plugged with cotton.

953
00:46:30,379 --> 00:46:32,523
It would be nice to
have a musician. - Yes.

954
00:46:32,843 --> 00:46:33,843
I believe so.

955
00:46:34,215 --> 00:46:35,710
Here at Royal Mansion,
we would have..

956
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:37,563
..different kinds of
musicians visiting us.

957
00:46:37,803 --> 00:46:40,533
Really?
- Yes. They would come, perform..

958
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:43,643
..then eat, and after
they ate, I would perform.

959
00:46:43,888 --> 00:46:45,561
But whenever I
performed they would leave.

960
00:46:45,648 --> 00:46:46,723
I don't know why. Selected.

961
00:46:58,664 --> 00:46:59,664
You're the boss.

962
00:47:01,926 --> 00:47:02,926
Hi, I am Tina.

963
00:47:03,314 --> 00:47:04,314
I am.. I am..I am

964
00:47:06,122 --> 00:47:07,202
No, no, it's alright.

965
00:47:07,521 --> 00:47:08,922
I'm Gendamal Hemraj.

966
00:47:09,042 --> 00:47:10,139
Please sit down.

967
00:47:10,762 --> 00:47:13,013
Daughter of famous
industrialist Pran Chopra.

968
00:47:14,104 --> 00:47:16,642
Power-plants, chemical industries,
real-estate.

969
00:47:16,842 --> 00:47:19,362
My dad used to do
every kind of business.

970
00:47:19,562 --> 00:47:22,563
You know what, I was a
really pampered kid.

971
00:47:22,962 --> 00:47:25,926
And on top of that,
I loved to party.

972
00:47:26,113 --> 00:47:28,184
Heineken was my favorite beer

973
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:30,322
One day I realized that..

974
00:47:30,402 --> 00:47:33,042
..due to partying
and drinking beer..

975
00:47:33,162 --> 00:47:35,162
..I had gained so much weight.

976
00:47:35,482 --> 00:47:37,263
Right then I joined a gym.

977
00:47:37,802 --> 00:47:40,682
And that's where I met Sam.

978
00:47:41,562 --> 00:47:42,562
Sam?

979
00:47:42,642 --> 00:47:44,722
Sam Gonzalvis,
my gym instructor.

980
00:47:44,802 --> 00:47:47,097
I was totally in love with him.

981
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:50,435
One day my mom-dad
found out everything.

982
00:47:50,842 --> 00:47:53,836
They tried to bribe
me for leaving Sam.

983
00:47:54,442 --> 00:47:55,802
But when I didn't agree..

984
00:47:55,922 --> 00:47:57,942
..they made Sam
disappear from Mumbai.

985
00:47:58,162 --> 00:47:59,626
I could never forget Sam.

986
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,202
I was in love.

987
00:48:01,642 --> 00:48:03,720
And I was completely heart-broken.

988
00:48:04,002 --> 00:48:06,057
I didn't know what to do.

989
00:48:06,442 --> 00:48:08,322
One day I climbed
up to the 10th floor..

990
00:48:08,442 --> 00:48:10,442
..and jumped down.

991
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:12,022
I killed myself.

992
00:48:12,402 --> 00:48:15,202
And when I died
I saw my parents crying.

993
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,373
I felt really, really sad.

994
00:48:23,162 --> 00:48:24,162
Accepted.

995
00:48:26,467 --> 00:48:27,242
Thanks.

996
00:48:27,282 --> 00:48:29,202
After the interview was over..

997
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:31,599
..Royal Mansion put up
a houseful board.

998
00:48:31,922 --> 00:48:33,322
And that night Gendamal..

999
00:48:33,402 --> 00:48:36,882
..called the selected ghosts
in the hall for a welcome drink.

1000
00:48:40,802 --> 00:48:43,282
My dear late Ladies and Gentlemen.

1001
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:47,727
A ghostly welcome to Royal Mansion.

1002
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:51,432
Today is a unique day for us.

1003
00:48:52,002 --> 00:48:53,362
It's unimaginable.

1004
00:48:53,442 --> 00:48:55,362
Because after today,
all of us..

1005
00:48:55,442 --> 00:48:56,915
..will be living
under the same roof..

1006
00:48:57,242 --> 00:48:59,366
..which might not have
been possible if we were humans.

1007
00:49:01,722 --> 00:49:02,722
Friends.

1008
00:49:02,962 --> 00:49:05,082
When we were alive,
the fear of death..

1009
00:49:05,162 --> 00:49:06,882
..wouldn't let us live peacefully.

1010
00:49:07,766 --> 00:49:09,122
But now we're dead.

1011
00:49:09,448 --> 00:49:11,042
Now we're not scared of death.

1012
00:49:13,322 --> 00:49:16,402
So come...from today
we enjoy our life..

1013
00:49:16,442 --> 00:49:19,082
I mean our afterlife.

1014
00:49:19,759 --> 00:49:24,322
And swear that we
couldn't be a good human being.

1015
00:49:24,535 --> 00:49:26,431
But we will definitely
be a good ghost.

1016
00:49:26,842 --> 00:49:28,762
And we'll make the
ghosts of Royal mansion..

1017
00:49:28,842 --> 00:49:31,322
..proud amongst the
ghosts in the world.

1018
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:32,802
Yes!
- Cheers.

1019
00:49:32,882 --> 00:49:34,042
Tell me one thing.

1020
00:49:34,122 --> 00:49:37,362
Did all the ghosts settle in
Royal Mansion? - Yes, sir.

1021
00:49:37,753 --> 00:49:40,762
All the ghosts lived
here comfortably.

1022
00:49:40,921 --> 00:49:42,402
Aatmaram.

1023
00:49:42,758 --> 00:49:44,322
You dead-man.

1024
00:49:44,602 --> 00:49:46,322
Where are you dying?

1025
00:49:46,402 --> 00:49:48,162
Hurry up.

1026
00:49:48,202 --> 00:49:49,242
Start the car.

1027
00:49:49,322 --> 00:49:50,882
I've to go to Dadar TT.

1028
00:49:51,002 --> 00:49:55,362
And I've to buy sweets
from Damodar's shop.

1029
00:49:56,802 --> 00:49:58,082
Aatmaram.

1030
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,322
You're a insult
to the ghost society.

1031
00:50:00,402 --> 00:50:03,002
It's morning
and you're still sleeping.

1032
00:50:03,082 --> 00:50:06,299
I am not sleeping, just
straightening my back.

1033
00:50:06,339 --> 00:50:09,562
Rascal, you're a crooked man
that's why you've a crooked back.

1034
00:50:09,642 --> 00:50:11,882
I don't know. I am a poor man.

1035
00:50:12,002 --> 00:50:13,322
Rascal.

1036
00:50:13,402 --> 00:50:15,082
If you're a poor man then
sit in the driver's seat.

1037
00:50:15,162 --> 00:50:16,242
What are you doing at the back?

1038
00:50:16,322 --> 00:50:17,402
Yes.
- And hurry up.

1039
00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:19,762
Hurry up,
I've to get to market soon.

1040
00:50:19,802 --> 00:50:21,642
Why the market so soon?

1041
00:50:21,682 --> 00:50:25,202
You fool, look there.

1042
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,922
In the sky.

1043
00:50:27,042 --> 00:50:28,522
The sky is this way.

1044
00:50:28,663 --> 00:50:30,722
Here too.
- You're a poor man.

1045
00:50:30,802 --> 00:50:31,922
So look here.
- I see.

1046
00:50:32,002 --> 00:50:36,682
See, the stars have set
and the sun is shining.

1047
00:50:37,082 --> 00:50:39,122
Now let's go, start the car.

1048
00:50:39,762 --> 00:50:42,722
The great Indian poor man.

1049
00:50:43,522 --> 00:50:45,162
But why does he have to buy?

1050
00:50:45,322 --> 00:50:47,442
He can just extend
his hand and steal it.

1051
00:50:47,522 --> 00:50:49,082
Sir, he's a Bengali
ghost after all.

1052
00:50:49,162 --> 00:50:50,722
Until he doesn't argue and haggle..

1053
00:50:50,802 --> 00:50:53,675
..with the shopkeeper,
who will call him...

1054
00:50:54,922 --> 00:50:57,802
You've done a good study
of the Bengali's character traits.

1055
00:50:57,882 --> 00:50:59,682
Thank you, sir. And
thank for this also, sir.

1056
00:50:59,762 --> 00:51:01,162
Sir, do you like the story?

1057
00:51:01,322 --> 00:51:03,802
That's why I am also giving
you your first installment.

1058
00:51:03,962 --> 00:51:04,802
Right, sir.

1059
00:51:04,842 --> 00:51:06,602
So all the shopping was done.

1060
00:51:06,913 --> 00:51:10,042
Bhootnath returned with
fresh sweets and snacks..

1061
00:51:10,242 --> 00:51:15,469
..to express his
eternal love to Manoranjana.

1062
00:51:16,563 --> 00:51:18,002
Stop. Stop.

1063
00:51:18,202 --> 00:51:19,962
I am stopping.

1064
00:51:20,134 --> 00:51:21,962
Why are you heading
out of the gate again?

1065
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:23,442
Now do one thing.

1066
00:51:23,562 --> 00:51:25,076
Get what's down there.

1067
00:51:25,657 --> 00:51:26,275
What?

1068
00:51:26,315 --> 00:51:29,042
Get what's down there.

1069
00:51:29,202 --> 00:51:30,122
Oh no.

1070
00:51:30,162 --> 00:51:31,202
No.

1071
00:51:31,282 --> 00:51:33,362
Get what's down there?
- How?

1072
00:51:33,562 --> 00:51:38,442
Not yours, what's down mine.
- What?

1073
00:51:38,482 --> 00:51:39,762
The bag.

1074
00:51:39,842 --> 00:51:41,442
Get the shopping bag.

1075
00:51:41,522 --> 00:51:43,007
It's between my legs.

1076
00:51:44,202 --> 00:51:46,202
Get it out.
- Yes, sir.

1077
00:51:47,006 --> 00:51:49,482
You might be a poor man,
but take bigger steps.

1078
00:51:49,717 --> 00:51:51,082
Hurry up!
Hurry up!

1079
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:56,042
How dare you come to the
1st floor in this uniform?

1080
00:51:56,271 --> 00:51:58,962
I don't know, sir.
I am a poor man.

1081
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:01,602
I wonder where I get
it from. I mean courage.

1082
00:52:01,682 --> 00:52:03,402
Keep the bags in the
kitchen and go down.

1083
00:52:03,482 --> 00:52:04,682
That's a good idea.

1084
00:52:04,802 --> 00:52:06,482
Keep it.

1085
00:52:07,794 --> 00:52:11,654
Bhootnath,
you're a high-class Bengali.

1086
00:52:12,432 --> 00:52:14,362
Why do you entertain
such lowly people?

1087
00:52:14,482 --> 00:52:17,682
You won't tell me who I'll
entertain and who I will not.

1088
00:52:17,846 --> 00:52:19,419
Because you're a
double-standard man.

1089
00:52:19,459 --> 00:52:20,745
You brought that home..

1090
00:52:20,785 --> 00:52:22,802
..for the sake of your
Biryanis and Kebabs.

1091
00:52:22,842 --> 00:52:24,682
Did I say something?
- Don't say that.

1092
00:52:24,803 --> 00:52:26,162
I am telling you..

1093
00:52:26,242 --> 00:52:27,722
You fools.

1094
00:52:27,947 --> 00:52:30,468
You're 21st century ghosts
and still talk about classes.

1095
00:52:30,763 --> 00:52:31,763
Now hear a song.

1096
00:52:31,842 --> 00:52:32,802
No, no.

1097
00:52:32,842 --> 00:52:34,983
Stop singing. Stop.

1098
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:38,624
I already died once. I don't want
to die again hearing your song.

1099
00:52:38,899 --> 00:52:41,922
I guess he lost his
musical sense when he died. - No.

1100
00:52:42,519 --> 00:52:44,402
My musical sense is intact.

1101
00:52:44,793 --> 00:52:47,177
But the way you sing,
it's not called music.

1102
00:52:47,393 --> 00:52:49,713
We selected him for this mansion..

1103
00:52:49,873 --> 00:52:53,860
..so that I will get to
hear classical music again.

1104
00:52:54,033 --> 00:52:56,593
But he turned
everything un-classical.

1105
00:52:56,713 --> 00:52:59,033
True. True.

1106
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:04,153
Bhootnath.

1107
00:53:04,873 --> 00:53:06,633
When I was alive,
I had a similar..

1108
00:53:06,713 --> 00:53:08,673
..old and grumpy man
in my neighborhood.

1109
00:53:09,033 --> 00:53:11,553
He used to speak
nonsense about my music.

1110
00:53:12,033 --> 00:53:13,833
Once that old man lodged a
complaint with the police..

1111
00:53:13,913 --> 00:53:15,233
..to stop my jam session.

1112
00:53:16,513 --> 00:53:18,073
It's the same situation
all over again..

1113
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,153
..even after I am dead.

1114
00:53:19,193 --> 00:53:21,433
Son, don't sulk.

1115
00:53:21,593 --> 00:53:23,153
Don't be sad.

1116
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:24,673
Do one thing.

1117
00:53:24,753 --> 00:53:26,993
Start singing folk songs.

1118
00:53:27,153 --> 00:53:29,113
If you don't know folk,
then sing patriotic songs.

1119
00:53:29,273 --> 00:53:30,873
Like 'Vande Mataram'..

1120
00:53:31,033 --> 00:53:32,473
Bhootnath. Bhootnath.

1121
00:53:32,673 --> 00:53:34,793
I've already prepared a
remix version of this song.

1122
00:53:34,873 --> 00:53:36,633
But I don't want my songs..

1123
00:53:36,673 --> 00:53:38,313
..to be bounded by country borders.

1124
00:53:38,393 --> 00:53:39,433
Great.

1125
00:53:39,513 --> 00:53:42,913
Wonderful, Robin. Wonderful.

1126
00:53:42,993 --> 00:53:46,833
What a dialogue...about music.

1127
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:55,713
But...according to me, sing
a song for broken heart..

1128
00:53:56,113 --> 00:53:58,793
..which compels me to drink.

1129
00:53:58,873 --> 00:54:00,553
One can sing about heartbreaks..

1130
00:54:00,593 --> 00:54:01,873
..only after a few pegs.

1131
00:54:01,953 --> 00:54:05,089
You mean first we down a few
pegs and then sing a song. - Right.

1132
00:54:05,188 --> 00:54:07,753
Then I'll take you
to Bhoot Bar today.

1133
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:08,833
Bhoot Bar.

1134
00:54:08,993 --> 00:54:10,833
Tonight's Friday night.

1135
00:54:11,044 --> 00:54:14,193
There must be gorgeous
ghosts visiting today.

1136
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,753
This is Bhoot Bar.

1137
00:54:19,793 --> 00:54:21,233
Amazing.

1138
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:23,233
It's so nice.

1139
00:54:23,433 --> 00:54:25,593
I thought she hasn't arrived yet.

1140
00:54:26,353 --> 00:54:27,793
Go get it.

1141
00:54:28,513 --> 00:54:29,873
Come on.

1142
00:54:31,689 --> 00:54:34,673
""..will you drink me?

1143
00:54:35,673 --> 00:54:42,473
""Intoxication is
something you can't let go.""

1144
00:54:43,183 --> 00:54:49,633
""It's like my beloved,
you just can't let go.""

1145
00:54:54,076 --> 00:54:57,473
""The bottle of alcohol's
such a rascal.""

1146
00:54:57,732 --> 00:55:00,873
""Will I drink you,
or will you drink me?""

1147
00:55:01,033 --> 00:55:04,513
""The bottle of alcohol's
such a rascal.""

1148
00:55:04,713 --> 00:55:07,713
""Will I drink you,
or will you drink me?""

1149
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:30,273
""The bottle of alcohol's
such a rascal.""

1150
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:33,993
""The bottle of alcohol's
such a rascal.""

1151
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:40,753
""The bottle of alcohol's
such a rascal.""

1152
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:48,153
""Will I drink you,
or will you drink me?""

1153
00:55:48,758 --> 00:55:54,915
""The bottle...
of alcohol's such a rascal.""

1154
00:55:55,105 --> 00:55:58,353
""The bottle of alcohol's
such a rascal.""

1155
00:55:58,593 --> 00:56:01,873
""Will I drink you,
or will you drink me?""

1156
00:56:02,033 --> 00:56:05,433
""The bottle of alcohol's
such a rascal.""

1157
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,873
""Will I drink you,
or will you drink me?""

1158
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:12,393
""Take a sip or gulp
down the entire bottle.""

1159
00:56:12,627 --> 00:56:15,633
""Forget the world,
let's shake the world.""

1160
00:56:15,852 --> 00:56:19,353
""Life's short,
let me drink half of it.""

1161
00:56:19,588 --> 00:56:21,513
""Forget all your sorrows,
take a peg.""

1162
00:56:21,593 --> 00:56:22,833
""Baby don't cry.""

1163
00:56:23,124 --> 00:56:26,313
""I couldn't find any love,
so I picked you.""

1164
00:56:26,792 --> 00:56:29,793
""I hadn't gotten over my first sorrow.""
""And now I invited another.""

1165
00:56:30,134 --> 00:56:33,353
""I couldn't find any love,
so I picked you.""

1166
00:56:33,784 --> 00:56:36,910
""I hadn't gotten over my first sorrow.""
""And now I invited another.""

1167
00:56:37,641 --> 00:56:44,153
""I couldn't find any love,
so I picked you.""

1168
00:56:44,721 --> 00:56:51,161
""I couldn't find any love,
so I picked you.""

1169
00:56:51,601 --> 00:56:55,001
""I hadn't gotten
over my first sorrow.""

1170
00:56:55,201 --> 00:56:58,401
""And now I invited another.""

1171
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:05,561
""You're bound to
drown in this sorrow.""

1172
00:57:05,685 --> 00:57:11,721
""The bottle of alcohol's
such a rascal.""

1173
00:57:15,481 --> 00:57:16,481
""Bottle.""

1174
00:58:08,544 --> 00:58:14,841
""The bottle of alcohol's
such a rascal.""

1175
00:58:21,721 --> 00:58:23,641
""The bottle of alcohol's..""

1176
00:58:25,481 --> 00:58:30,241
""Will I drink you,
or will you drink me?""

1177
00:58:41,121 --> 00:58:41,841
See, sir.

1178
00:58:41,881 --> 00:58:44,321
It matches to your vision.

1179
00:58:44,401 --> 00:58:45,321
Matching.

1180
00:58:45,361 --> 00:58:48,361
Biggest commercial
complex in the country, sir.

1181
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:51,161
Superb. Find the owner.

1182
00:58:51,511 --> 00:58:52,761
Guliyani, sir.

1183
00:58:52,841 --> 00:58:54,961
Yes, Guliyani. Find the owner.

1184
00:58:55,121 --> 00:58:58,041
But, sir, there's a problem.

1185
00:59:00,281 --> 00:59:04,041
We builders setup our shop
where there's a problem.

1186
00:59:04,401 --> 00:59:08,081
So Gu, I want this Royal Mansion.

1187
00:59:08,576 --> 00:59:10,401
At any cost.

1188
00:59:10,649 --> 00:59:12,001
Get that?
- Yes, sir.

1189
00:59:12,161 --> 00:59:15,801
""Where do we go?""

1190
00:59:20,478 --> 00:59:21,718
Silence.
- Start sound.

1191
00:59:21,798 --> 00:59:22,998
Rolling.
- Camera.

1192
00:59:23,078 --> 00:59:24,118
Rolling. Clap.

1193
00:59:24,198 --> 00:59:25,958
Take 7.
- Action.

1194
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:28,798
Cut. Cut. Cut.

1195
00:59:32,437 --> 00:59:36,158
Manoranjana.
Who are you cutting?

1196
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:38,717
I was dreaming.

1197
00:59:38,757 --> 00:59:41,718
Dreaming? - I am
shooting for a film and..

1198
00:59:41,918 --> 00:59:45,878
You've crossed
the LOC of your life.

1199
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,958
So I suggest that you..

1200
00:59:48,078 --> 00:59:50,478
..stop dreaming about
shootings and films.

1201
00:59:50,786 --> 00:59:53,478
Whether a film actor
leaves her work or the world..

1202
00:59:53,872 --> 00:59:57,678
..but she can never forget
those gleaming arc lights.

1203
00:59:57,821 --> 00:59:58,821
Wow.

1204
00:59:59,514 --> 01:00:00,598
The camera.

1205
01:00:01,299 --> 01:00:02,299
The Nagra.

1206
01:00:02,817 --> 01:00:03,878
The green room.

1207
01:00:04,349 --> 01:00:05,998
Ice box, spot boy.

1208
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,278
Food from hero's home.
- Wow.

1209
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:14,853
Watching your passion
for your work..

1210
01:00:15,013 --> 01:00:17,681
..even after you're dead
has made me your...deadly fan.

1211
01:00:19,689 --> 01:00:21,398
Autograph please.

1212
01:00:21,588 --> 01:00:24,838
I don't sign on currency notes.
- Why?

1213
01:00:25,438 --> 01:00:29,186
When the chairman
of the Reserve Bank..

1214
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:32,598
..has already signed on it,
then how can I sign it?

1215
01:00:35,106 --> 01:00:36,398
Sigh my palm.

1216
01:00:37,827 --> 01:00:38,877
Pen please.

1217
01:00:40,634 --> 01:00:41,615
Name please.

1218
01:00:41,655 --> 01:00:43,038
Hoshiyar Singh.

1219
01:00:44,618 --> 01:00:49,738
Love to Hoshiyar Singh,
Manoranjana Kumari.

1220
01:00:51,658 --> 01:00:55,298
I will never wash this hand again,
even if I've to cut it.

1221
01:00:56,433 --> 01:01:00,338
You know, in 1965 when
I was in Khardunla..

1222
01:01:00,818 --> 01:01:03,538
You must be in an epic
battle with the enemy.

1223
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:04,578
No.

1224
01:01:04,618 --> 01:01:06,218
I was watching your film.

1225
01:01:06,298 --> 01:01:07,938
Love can happen anytime.

1226
01:01:08,378 --> 01:01:09,658
Such a nice title.

1227
01:01:09,738 --> 01:01:11,184
Love can happen anytime.

1228
01:01:11,536 --> 01:01:12,536
It can happen now too.

1229
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:16,338
""I am such a crazy Jatt.""

1230
01:01:18,075 --> 01:01:21,018
""I am such a crazy Jatt.""

1231
01:01:21,134 --> 01:01:24,338
""Couldn't understand
such a simple thing.""

1232
01:01:24,418 --> 01:01:25,138
""That..""

1233
01:01:25,178 --> 01:01:26,258
Hoshiyar Singh.

1234
01:01:26,338 --> 01:01:27,898
You're showing your smartness here.

1235
01:01:27,978 --> 01:01:29,538
And Gaindamal's looking for you.

1236
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:31,898
Let's go.
- Okay.

1237
01:01:32,298 --> 01:01:33,578
Okay.

1238
01:01:34,032 --> 01:01:36,818
Thank you for your autograph.

1239
01:01:39,715 --> 01:01:43,011
We got introduced.
- Hurry up.

1240
01:01:43,218 --> 01:01:44,178
Come on.

1241
01:01:44,218 --> 01:01:47,538
""She loves.""

1242
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:50,578
""She's crazy about me.""

1243
01:01:50,778 --> 01:01:51,778
Sir.

1244
01:01:53,171 --> 01:01:54,658
You called, sir.

1245
01:01:55,098 --> 01:01:55,858
Who's the boss?

1246
01:01:55,898 --> 01:01:56,978
I am the boss.
Who's the boss?

1247
01:01:57,058 --> 01:01:58,738
You're the boss.
- The boss didn't call you.

1248
01:01:58,818 --> 01:01:59,578
Rotate this.

1249
01:01:59,618 --> 01:02:02,898
Manoranjana, I've seen
all your plays. - Plays?

1250
01:02:03,018 --> 01:02:07,058
No, no, I mean cinema.

1251
01:02:07,538 --> 01:02:13,138
After watching your first
film I fell in love with you.

1252
01:02:13,218 --> 01:02:15,778
Like they say,
love at first night.

1253
01:02:16,893 --> 01:02:18,138
Love at first sight.

1254
01:02:18,296 --> 01:02:20,858
I know it's love at first sight.

1255
01:02:20,999 --> 01:02:22,618
But I saw the night show.

1256
01:02:22,783 --> 01:02:25,298
So I said love at first night.

1257
01:02:25,691 --> 01:02:28,138
Oh, God! I guess the
old man's lost his mind.

1258
01:02:28,218 --> 01:02:29,898
I didn't hear anything.

1259
01:02:30,256 --> 01:02:33,498
I was a big fan of your
since I was just a kid.

1260
01:02:33,578 --> 01:02:36,058
You know, I also
made a fan club for you.

1261
01:02:36,254 --> 01:02:39,378
And in that club we
all addressed you as Ma.

1262
01:02:41,086 --> 01:02:42,858
Not as in mother.

1263
01:02:42,978 --> 01:02:44,738
By Ma we meant Goddess.

1264
01:02:44,858 --> 01:02:48,898
Bhootnath, the movie
world is a bad place.

1265
01:02:49,451 --> 01:02:51,098
My Guru used to say..

1266
01:02:51,428 --> 01:02:53,298
..that you can stay in
this glittering world..

1267
01:02:53,378 --> 01:02:56,258
..only as long as
you stay beautiful.

1268
01:02:56,362 --> 01:02:57,538
Once your beauty disappears..

1269
01:02:57,618 --> 01:02:58,872
..you will disappear.

1270
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:02,818
How could your Guru say that?

1271
01:03:03,107 --> 01:03:06,138
Beauty is not a pot of tea..

1272
01:03:06,218 --> 01:03:08,658
..that when the tea's over,
the pot's broken.

1273
01:03:09,011 --> 01:03:12,218
Manoranjana,
your time will never be up.

1274
01:03:12,557 --> 01:03:15,218
Because you were beautiful,
you still are..

1275
01:03:15,298 --> 01:03:16,860
..and forever will be.

1276
01:03:16,953 --> 01:03:20,138
There's no point in
praising me now, Bhootnath.

1277
01:03:20,378 --> 01:03:23,406
It's very late now.
- I understand.

1278
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:26,738
But Manoranjana,
everyone's late here.

1279
01:03:27,022 --> 01:03:29,258
I am late Bhootnath Bhaduri.

1280
01:03:29,527 --> 01:03:32,058
You're late Manoranjana Kumari.

1281
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,178
But before it's too late.

1282
01:03:34,948 --> 01:03:37,858
Sweets and snacks for you.

1283
01:03:38,399 --> 01:03:40,942
Bhootnath,
this isn't time for sweets.

1284
01:03:41,072 --> 01:03:43,178
Yes, I understand. I understand.

1285
01:03:43,518 --> 01:03:46,298
I get it. This is
time for something else.

1286
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:50,138
But Manoranjana, I
want to say something.

1287
01:03:50,942 --> 01:03:53,762
Like all men, you'll say..

1288
01:03:53,981 --> 01:03:56,985
..Manoranjana, I love you a lot.

1289
01:03:57,508 --> 01:04:00,378
I am fed up of
hearing this dialogue.

1290
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,938
Why will I say that?

1291
01:04:03,814 --> 01:04:06,605
I will say what I want.

1292
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:09,500
And I want to hear you sing.

1293
01:04:10,506 --> 01:04:11,506
What?

1294
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:13,538
Shameless.
Aren't you ashamed?

1295
01:04:13,661 --> 01:04:14,661
I'll show you.

1296
01:04:14,858 --> 01:04:15,858
Anybody there.

1297
01:04:16,212 --> 01:04:17,090
Anybody there.

1298
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:18,578
Manoranjana.

1299
01:04:18,887 --> 01:04:20,658
I meant song.

1300
01:04:20,698 --> 01:04:22,477
Singing.

1301
01:04:22,683 --> 01:04:24,818
""Open your door.""

1302
01:04:25,012 --> 01:04:26,765
""I am standing at your threshold.""

1303
01:04:26,859 --> 01:04:30,401
""Don't let me standout anymore.""

1304
01:04:30,627 --> 01:04:32,818
Who's there? Who's bothering you?

1305
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,168
Manoranjana, my love..

1306
01:04:35,323 --> 01:04:38,018
..this Bhootnath's after you again.

1307
01:04:38,299 --> 01:04:39,538
But don't be scared.

1308
01:04:39,915 --> 01:04:42,245
This is Muslim-Maratha,
Khwaja Akbar Khan..

1309
01:04:42,327 --> 01:04:44,304
..chef of king Malhar
Holkar speaking.

1310
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:47,326
I will teach him a lesson.

1311
01:04:47,396 --> 01:04:51,154
You rascal,
you will teach me a lesson.

1312
01:04:51,286 --> 01:04:54,818
A soldier without a shield and
sword and come here holding a rose.

1313
01:04:54,858 --> 01:04:58,178
Mind your tongue, Bhootnath.

1314
01:04:58,423 --> 01:05:00,873
Oh, God! What's going on?

1315
01:05:01,038 --> 01:05:04,718
Accept this lover's true
love and take this rose..

1316
01:05:04,878 --> 01:05:09,198
..and I'll personally
cook for you Kebabs.

1317
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:12,198
And then you'll
suffer from loose motions.

1318
01:05:12,278 --> 01:05:14,318
Enemy of my love, be alert.

1319
01:05:14,438 --> 01:05:18,598
If you have Urdu poems
then I've Bengal Tigers.

1320
01:05:18,678 --> 01:05:19,638
I won't be scared.

1321
01:05:19,678 --> 01:05:20,758
You won't be scared?
- No.

1322
01:05:20,838 --> 01:05:22,478
Then you will be killed by me.

1323
01:05:22,558 --> 01:05:24,040
Come on.
- I see.

1324
01:05:24,131 --> 01:05:25,518
I will die. You will kill me?

1325
01:05:25,558 --> 01:05:27,838
Rascal, how will you kill me?

1326
01:05:27,918 --> 01:05:30,146
How will you kill me?
- Don't provoke me.

1327
01:05:30,186 --> 01:05:31,998
Will you kill me with
the plastic rose?

1328
01:05:32,078 --> 01:05:33,798
There goes your plastic rose.

1329
01:05:33,878 --> 01:05:35,318
What the..

1330
01:05:38,598 --> 01:05:39,718
What's up, sister?

1331
01:05:39,758 --> 01:05:41,341
You've hit the jackpot.

1332
01:05:41,518 --> 01:05:42,918
One rose and three admirers.

1333
01:05:42,973 --> 01:05:45,758
Oh my, God! How will I
handle three lovers?

1334
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:46,838
Three.

1335
01:05:47,237 --> 01:05:50,558
I'm experienced
at handling 30, Tina.

1336
01:05:50,858 --> 01:05:54,198
But these are old men,
and they're all dead.

1337
01:05:55,108 --> 01:05:57,438
But there's a nice
boy for you here.

1338
01:05:57,584 --> 01:05:59,918
He's single, and also ready to
mingle. If I would be at your place

1339
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:02,798
I would've taken
him on a long-drive..

1340
01:06:02,878 --> 01:06:04,198
..and eaten dinner with him.

1341
01:06:06,278 --> 01:06:07,745
You smoke so much?

1342
01:06:08,038 --> 01:06:10,198
Haven't you heard?
Smoking is injurious to health.

1343
01:06:10,278 --> 01:06:12,318
Sweetheart, when there's no
health then what's it injurious to?

1344
01:06:12,438 --> 01:06:14,478
Whatever it is, it's really bad.

1345
01:06:14,598 --> 01:06:15,878
It's stinking man.

1346
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:19,383
Tell me,
when did you start singing?

1347
01:06:19,998 --> 01:06:21,118
When I was born.

1348
01:06:21,438 --> 01:06:23,078
But when a child is born he cries.

1349
01:06:23,158 --> 01:06:24,078
I was singing.

1350
01:06:24,118 --> 01:06:27,238
But you know, people
like love, romantic music..

1351
01:06:27,318 --> 01:06:29,678
..more than what you sing.

1352
01:06:29,758 --> 01:06:31,238
To hell with it.

1353
01:06:31,438 --> 01:06:35,318
I've forsaken romance and
romantic music from my system.

1354
01:06:35,931 --> 01:06:38,678
I don't let flowers, mountains,
river, waterfalls, love..

1355
01:06:38,758 --> 01:06:40,198
..anywhere close to my music.

1356
01:06:40,278 --> 01:06:43,078
I don't sing from the mouth
I sing from my entire body.

1357
01:06:43,318 --> 01:06:47,396
A song that has passion,
openness, liberty.

1358
01:06:48,198 --> 01:06:51,358
That means you will
never sing romantic songs?

1359
01:06:51,859 --> 01:06:53,838
Never.
- But why?

1360
01:06:54,082 --> 01:06:55,438
Do you want to know the answer?

1361
01:07:04,785 --> 01:07:06,782
""I am scared of being betrayed.""

1362
01:07:06,929 --> 01:07:09,238
""My heart be filled with pain.""

1363
01:07:13,126 --> 01:07:15,598
""I am scared of being betrayed.""

1364
01:07:15,722 --> 01:07:17,676
""My heart be filled with pain.""

1365
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:19,946
""The thought of it makes me sweat.""

1366
01:07:20,075 --> 01:07:22,118
""The thought of it makes me sweat.""

1367
01:07:23,238 --> 01:07:25,358
""Love's such a rascal.""

1368
01:07:25,398 --> 01:07:27,598
""Love's such a rascal.""

1369
01:07:27,758 --> 01:07:29,696
""Love's such a rascal.""

1370
01:07:29,736 --> 01:07:31,958
""Love's such a rascal.""

1371
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:45,238
""Any boy who falls in
love with his neighbor.""

1372
01:07:47,539 --> 01:07:51,638
""Any boy who falls in
love with his neighbor.""

1373
01:07:51,855 --> 01:07:53,347
""You can bet that..""

1374
01:07:53,395 --> 01:07:55,958
""..he'll be fixing
tents in her marriage.""

1375
01:07:56,118 --> 01:07:57,958
""It's a constant threat to life.""

1376
01:07:58,038 --> 01:08:00,318
""It's a constant threat to life.""

1377
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:02,472
""It's a constant threat to life.""

1378
01:08:02,512 --> 01:08:04,696
""It's a constant threat to life.""

1379
01:08:04,867 --> 01:08:07,001
""Love's such a rascal.""

1380
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,038
""Love's such a rascal.""

1381
01:08:09,238 --> 01:08:11,153
""Love's such a rascal.""

1382
01:08:11,243 --> 01:08:13,478
""Love's such a rascal.""

1383
01:08:13,638 --> 01:08:15,918
""Love's such a rascal.""

1384
01:08:15,998 --> 01:08:17,838
""Love's such a rascal.""

1385
01:08:18,038 --> 01:08:20,166
""Love's such a rascal.""

1386
01:08:20,206 --> 01:08:22,438
""Love's such a rascal.""

1387
01:08:39,998 --> 01:08:44,598
""Love's a butcher, it ruins a man.""

1388
01:08:46,678 --> 01:08:50,718
""Love's a butcher, it ruins a man.""

1389
01:08:51,195 --> 01:08:55,278
""It makes your market
value zero in a minute.""

1390
01:08:55,318 --> 01:08:59,478
""Life will be worse than death.""

1391
01:08:59,638 --> 01:09:03,678
""Life will be worse than death.""

1392
01:09:04,118 --> 01:09:05,903
""Love's such a rascal.""

1393
01:09:05,943 --> 01:09:08,318
""Love's such a rascal.""

1394
01:09:08,704 --> 01:09:10,398
""Love's such a rascal.""

1395
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:12,838
""Love's such a rascal.""

1396
01:09:28,254 --> 01:09:30,478
""Love's such a rascal.""

1397
01:09:30,942 --> 01:09:32,878
This is Haryanvi rock.

1398
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:37,517
Wow. Simply superb.

1399
01:09:37,557 --> 01:09:38,878
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

1400
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:41,358
This is a complete
insanity ambiance.

1401
01:09:41,398 --> 01:09:43,738
No, sir, hauntedness.
- What?

1402
01:09:43,968 --> 01:09:44,968
Hauntedness?

1403
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,014
Nice one.

1404
01:09:46,169 --> 01:09:49,478
So all the ghosts were
spending their days..

1405
01:09:49,598 --> 01:09:51,638
..with love and affection.

1406
01:09:52,075 --> 01:09:54,558
But one day suddenly
a problem came up.

1407
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:57,078
Problem? For the ghosts?

1408
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:01,056
I had heard that
ghosts trouble people.

1409
01:10:01,096 --> 01:10:03,358
Yes, sir. But the situation
was different here.

1410
01:10:03,922 --> 01:10:05,878
The people were
troubling the ghosts.

1411
01:10:16,424 --> 01:10:19,778
They've turned Royal
Mansion into a vegetable market.

1412
01:10:20,063 --> 01:10:21,478
They're hammering
a nail on every wall.

1413
01:10:21,875 --> 01:10:22,875
Someone's taking a nap.

1414
01:10:22,936 --> 01:10:24,798
Someone throwing used plates.
And someone's spitting.

1415
01:10:25,097 --> 01:10:26,638
And they've setup a
rail-track on the floor..

1416
01:10:26,718 --> 01:10:28,598
..and people are getting
on and off that thing.

1417
01:10:29,025 --> 01:10:31,447
That means they
have no civic sense.

1418
01:10:31,487 --> 01:10:34,558
And the heroine has filled my room
with smoke from her cigarette.

1419
01:10:35,012 --> 01:10:36,095
I was a film actress too.

1420
01:10:36,305 --> 01:10:38,198
But even I never
smoked so many cigarettes.

1421
01:10:38,578 --> 01:10:39,878
And she's showing such attitude.

1422
01:10:40,137 --> 01:10:41,215
Let's lodge a report
at the police station.

1423
01:10:41,257 --> 01:10:43,104
Who will lodge a ghost's report?

1424
01:10:43,223 --> 01:10:45,650
And anyway, they already
bribe the police at first.

1425
01:10:45,829 --> 01:10:47,743
Then we'll have to
use our special power.

1426
01:10:47,886 --> 01:10:48,592
What's that?

1427
01:10:48,632 --> 01:10:49,678
Let's scare them away.

1428
01:10:50,146 --> 01:10:53,955
Sister, I feel you should
teach that heroine a lesson first.

1429
01:10:54,313 --> 01:10:55,218
Fine.

1430
01:10:55,258 --> 01:10:57,978
All the film actresses are
nervous before the shot.

1431
01:10:58,218 --> 01:10:59,698
I'll scare her so badly..

1432
01:10:59,778 --> 01:11:01,618
..that she'll never
act again in her life.

1433
01:11:01,789 --> 01:11:03,298
Scene 1, take 1.

1434
01:11:04,035 --> 01:11:05,298
And action.

1435
01:11:26,978 --> 01:11:30,018
She fell down,
the shooting was cancelled.

1436
01:11:30,178 --> 01:11:33,298
Mid Day and Mirror covered
the story on their front page.

1437
01:11:33,378 --> 01:11:36,338
And slowly the news, that
GH Mills and Royal Mansion..

1438
01:11:36,418 --> 01:11:38,898
..are haunted, spread in
the entire film industry.

1439
01:11:39,178 --> 01:11:42,618
Producers and
directors stopped filming here.

1440
01:11:43,298 --> 01:11:45,218
The ghosts of Royal Mansion won..

1441
01:11:45,298 --> 01:11:47,218
..and it was celebration time.

1442
01:11:47,458 --> 01:11:48,938
And on this joyous occasion..

1443
01:11:49,018 --> 01:11:51,904
..Gaindamal decided to take
all the ghosts out for a picnic.

1444
01:11:52,715 --> 01:11:55,446
""Here come the care fee ghosts.""

1445
01:11:55,538 --> 01:11:58,178
""Care free ghosts.""

1446
01:11:58,258 --> 01:12:01,018
""Care free ghosts.""

1447
01:12:09,938 --> 01:12:11,898
It feels so strange, right?

1448
01:12:12,218 --> 01:12:14,498
We ghosts are out on
the beach to party..

1449
01:12:14,578 --> 01:12:16,018
..and have a blast.

1450
01:12:16,223 --> 01:12:20,515
Bhootnath, we ghosts
have the right to have fun.

1451
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:23,418
The biggest advantage
of being a ghost is..

1452
01:12:23,498 --> 01:12:24,858
..we don't need
any visa or passport.

1453
01:12:24,938 --> 01:12:27,538
We can go anywhere, any place,
any time and anyway we want.

1454
01:12:28,658 --> 01:12:30,698
Right, Aatmaram?
- I don't know, sir.

1455
01:12:30,941 --> 01:12:32,338
I am a poor man.

1456
01:12:35,696 --> 01:12:37,338
You lost with 15
- Love.

1457
01:12:37,723 --> 01:12:39,378
I've already lost.

1458
01:12:39,602 --> 01:12:42,218
But I really liked
one thing today, Robin.

1459
01:12:42,628 --> 01:12:43,498
What? My game?

1460
01:12:43,538 --> 01:12:46,298
No, I heard you say
'love' 15 times today.

1461
01:12:46,538 --> 01:12:48,698
""Mister, walk slowly.""

1462
01:12:49,288 --> 01:12:51,818
""Be careful in love.""

1463
01:12:52,229 --> 01:12:53,578
Very nice.

1464
01:12:53,881 --> 01:12:55,634
The oil is wonderful.

1465
01:12:55,674 --> 01:12:57,578
Hey mister, this isn't the oil..

1466
01:12:57,658 --> 01:12:59,218
..it's the magic of my hands.

1467
01:12:59,644 --> 01:13:01,704
Once I make any vegetable..

1468
01:13:01,909 --> 01:13:04,532
..whether it's a Bengali or a Bihari
he can't stop licking his hands.

1469
01:13:04,665 --> 01:13:06,938
Khwaja, tell me one thing.

1470
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:08,858
Did you forsake the
sword and take up the ladle..

1471
01:13:08,938 --> 01:13:10,498
..or forsake the ladle
and take up the sword?

1472
01:13:10,538 --> 01:13:12,743
Insolent, audacious fool.
How dare you joke with me?

1473
01:13:13,058 --> 01:13:14,058
Sorry. Sorry.

1474
01:13:14,138 --> 01:13:15,578
I was only pulling your string.

1475
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:17,298
I was joking..

1476
01:13:17,761 --> 01:13:19,338
But I'll be honest with you.

1477
01:13:19,518 --> 01:13:21,898
You really cook well.
- Thank you, mister.

1478
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,178
Not the food, you bore me too much.

1479
01:13:25,402 --> 01:13:26,858
With your hideous poems.

1480
01:13:26,898 --> 01:13:28,618
Why you..

1481
01:13:28,938 --> 01:13:31,250
You pollute the
place where you eat.

1482
01:13:31,704 --> 01:13:33,378
Brother, can I sit here?

1483
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:35,418
Sitting.
- No, no.

1484
01:13:35,498 --> 01:13:36,658
It's sit. Sit.

1485
01:13:36,738 --> 01:13:38,167
Sit. Sit.

1486
01:13:38,975 --> 01:13:40,695
Brother, you love eating.

1487
01:13:40,815 --> 01:13:43,255
You talk to a Bengali about eating.

1488
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:45,135
A Bengali eats so much..

1489
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:47,414
..that he squanders his
entire money on eating.

1490
01:13:48,335 --> 01:13:51,895
That's why the food's
tasty but not nutritious.

1491
01:13:52,015 --> 01:13:55,615
We eat for taste, not to wrestle.

1492
01:13:56,855 --> 01:13:58,815
What food do you get in Mumbai?

1493
01:13:58,895 --> 01:14:02,471
'Bhelpuri, Sevpuri,
Panipuri, Madam Puri, Amrish Puri.'

1494
01:14:02,537 --> 01:14:05,335
It seems like the surname
of the entire Puri family.

1495
01:14:05,975 --> 01:14:07,735
There's only 'Jhol'
(curry) in Bengali food.

1496
01:14:07,815 --> 01:14:09,335
'Fish curry, potato curry.

1497
01:14:09,455 --> 01:14:11,455
Curry, curry and more curry.

1498
01:14:11,575 --> 01:14:12,655
No, brother.

1499
01:14:12,735 --> 01:14:15,775
Before pointing finger at a Bengali
take a peak in your own wok.

1500
01:14:15,855 --> 01:14:17,695
What do you have in Mumbai's wok?

1501
01:14:17,815 --> 01:14:20,141
Except for the 'Puri' family
just a dry 'Vada pav' (Fritter).

1502
01:14:20,181 --> 01:14:21,455
Hey!

1503
01:14:21,695 --> 01:14:23,255
Vada Pav is the pride of Mumbai.

1504
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:25,135
'Bhelpuri, Sevpuri, Panipuri..'

1505
01:14:25,215 --> 01:14:26,775
..are the symbol of our unity.

1506
01:14:26,855 --> 01:14:28,335
And a person from
every community eats it.

1507
01:14:28,415 --> 01:14:30,175
And Mumbai has a specialty.

1508
01:14:30,255 --> 01:14:31,695
Here a person gets up
on a empty stomach..

1509
01:14:31,775 --> 01:14:33,015
..but never sleeps hungry.

1510
01:14:33,095 --> 01:14:36,655
And the credit goes to 'Bhelpuri,
Sevpuri, Panipuri and Vada Pav.'

1511
01:14:36,735 --> 01:14:38,935
Scoundrel refugee.

1512
01:14:39,015 --> 01:14:41,575
You lived, slept
and woke up in Mumbai.

1513
01:14:41,655 --> 01:14:44,895
But didn't you feel hurt
while insulting Vada Pav.

1514
01:14:44,935 --> 01:14:47,175
From today you're out
of the Royal Mansion.

1515
01:14:47,255 --> 01:14:48,735
Out!
- Out!

1516
01:14:48,908 --> 01:14:50,535
I was only having a discussion.

1517
01:14:50,615 --> 01:14:53,800
And it's important for a
Bengali to win every discussion.

1518
01:14:56,043 --> 01:14:58,535
Fine, I admit I lost
this discussion. Okay.

1519
01:14:59,231 --> 01:15:00,255
Come on, say sorry.

1520
01:15:00,295 --> 01:15:01,815
Now.
- Who's the boss?

1521
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:03,114
I am the boss. Who's the boss?

1522
01:15:03,254 --> 01:15:04,575
You're the boss.
- Now say sorry.

1523
01:15:04,735 --> 01:15:05,735
Sorry.
- Say sorry.

1524
01:15:05,775 --> 01:15:07,016
Say sorry.
- Sorry.

1525
01:15:07,056 --> 01:15:08,815
Say sorry sister.
- I won't say it.

1526
01:15:08,855 --> 01:15:10,735
I will say sorry but I
won't call her sister.

1527
01:15:10,775 --> 01:15:13,255
It's a wonderful
situation for an argument.

1528
01:15:13,512 --> 01:15:17,135
Robin would've made a
nice song on this situation.

1529
01:15:17,175 --> 01:15:18,601
But where is Robin?

1530
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:20,761
You girls are crazy.

1531
01:15:21,241 --> 01:15:23,681
Love, love, in everything
you want to get love.

1532
01:15:23,961 --> 01:15:25,441
Don't you have anything else to do?

1533
01:15:25,641 --> 01:15:26,641
What is your problem?

1534
01:15:26,761 --> 01:15:28,561
Why do you hate girls?

1535
01:15:28,761 --> 01:15:31,441
Did someone ditch you?
- One?

1536
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:34,401
If I start counting
you'll be jealous.

1537
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:38,481
All girls are crazy about money.
- Wrong.

1538
01:15:38,681 --> 01:15:41,041
There are some girls
who are crazy about love.

1539
01:15:41,201 --> 01:15:42,641
The example is right before you.

1540
01:15:42,801 --> 01:15:44,281
Yes.

1541
01:15:44,841 --> 01:15:46,641
You don't even mention the name..

1542
01:15:46,761 --> 01:15:48,921
..for the one you
jumped from the 10th floor.

1543
01:15:49,161 --> 01:15:50,706
Instead you try to flirt with me.

1544
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:54,081
Oh...

1545
01:15:54,442 --> 01:15:56,001
Tina, what happened?

1546
01:15:56,733 --> 01:15:57,601
What happened?

1547
01:15:57,641 --> 01:16:00,601
Why should I take that greedy,
cheater's name?

1548
01:16:00,681 --> 01:16:03,321
He first cheated
me and then killed me.

1549
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:05,441
He did what your father said.

1550
01:16:05,681 --> 01:16:06,681
What could he do?

1551
01:16:06,875 --> 01:16:08,056
I lied.

1552
01:16:10,401 --> 01:16:12,081
After I died I found out.. Oh !

1553
01:16:12,281 --> 01:16:14,441
..that Sam was never
shifted out of Mumbai.

1554
01:16:14,801 --> 01:16:18,982
In fact, he asked for a big money
from my dad to leave me and Mumbai.

1555
01:16:19,401 --> 01:16:21,801
And after taking the
money he went to Australia.

1556
01:16:21,968 --> 01:16:23,642
He completely forgot me.

1557
01:16:24,923 --> 01:16:26,401
He never loved me.

1558
01:16:27,248 --> 01:16:28,441
Sorry, Tina.

1559
01:16:29,038 --> 01:16:30,321
I am really sorry.

1560
01:16:32,241 --> 01:16:34,401
Forget it.
Give me a smile.

1561
01:16:35,554 --> 01:16:37,441
Smile. Tina.

1562
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:40,041
Tina, listen.

1563
01:16:40,081 --> 01:16:42,961
Tina, you always say why
do I sing meaningless songs.

1564
01:16:43,435 --> 01:16:45,537
I'll sing a
romantic-sweet song for you today.

1565
01:16:47,001 --> 01:16:48,201
But on one condition.

1566
01:16:48,691 --> 01:16:50,481
Before I sing you
will have to smile.

1567
01:16:51,001 --> 01:16:52,001
Now smile.

1568
01:17:03,230 --> 01:17:08,641
""Its love that I see
in my beloved's eye.""

1569
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:16,121
""I know you're restless..""

1570
01:17:16,343 --> 01:17:19,441
""..to cajole Hooda.""

1571
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:25,481
""My confused heart's
finally at peace.""

1572
01:17:41,313 --> 01:17:45,001
""O dark glasses,
what's your scene.""

1573
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:51,801
""O long tresses,
what's your scene.""

1574
01:17:55,196 --> 01:17:58,201
""What's your scene?""
""What's your scene?""

1575
01:17:58,431 --> 01:18:02,001
""Don't waste our time.""

1576
01:18:03,754 --> 01:18:07,281
""Tell us clearly who do you want?""

1577
01:18:15,997 --> 01:18:17,841
""My throat's dry.""

1578
01:18:20,241 --> 01:18:22,841
""Get me my favorite booze.""

1579
01:18:26,223 --> 01:18:27,841
""My throat's dry.""

1580
01:18:28,001 --> 01:18:30,641
""Get me my favorite booze.""

1581
01:18:31,637 --> 01:18:35,121
""SAD 69, o beloved.""

1582
01:18:35,359 --> 01:18:36,801
""My throat's dry.""

1583
01:18:38,351 --> 01:18:46,001
""You dwell in my heartbeats.""

1584
01:18:46,482 --> 01:18:54,401
""I've brought what you
drink day and night.""

1585
01:18:54,732 --> 01:18:57,921
""Drink until you're knocked out.""

1586
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:02,561
""And come in my arms.""

1587
01:19:03,977 --> 01:19:07,401
""Father's in the courtyard..""

1588
01:19:08,164 --> 01:19:10,481
""..and your lovers
at the threshold.""

1589
01:19:10,744 --> 01:19:14,681
""How do I get in your house?""

1590
01:19:17,867 --> 01:19:19,641
""Father's in the courtyard..""

1591
01:19:19,801 --> 01:19:21,721
""..and your lovers
at the threshold.""

1592
01:19:22,076 --> 01:19:25,161
""How do I get in your house?""

1593
01:19:25,369 --> 01:19:29,001
""How do I get in your house?""

1594
01:19:29,147 --> 01:19:32,601
""My father's gone away.""
""And my lover's are hanging.""

1595
01:19:32,799 --> 01:19:36,201
""My father's gone away.""
""And my lover's are hanging.""

1596
01:19:36,422 --> 01:19:39,881
""Now pack your bags
and run to Bihar.""

1597
01:19:40,139 --> 01:19:43,441
""Now pack your bags
and run to Bihar.""

1598
01:19:45,711 --> 01:19:49,201
""The heart's said to your heart.""

1599
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:54,660
""I am in love with you.""

1600
01:19:57,094 --> 01:19:59,601
""The heart's said to your heart.""

1601
01:19:59,835 --> 01:20:02,348
""The heart's said to your heart.""

1602
01:20:02,664 --> 01:20:05,301
""I am in love with you.""

1603
01:20:05,504 --> 01:20:08,107
""I am in love with you.""

1604
01:20:08,201 --> 01:20:10,850
""My friend just chill.""

1605
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,576
""Come and fill my empty life.""

1606
01:20:13,939 --> 01:20:19,158
""Be just as crazy as I am.""

1607
01:20:19,566 --> 01:20:22,000
""Understand my dilemma.""

1608
01:20:22,328 --> 01:20:25,201
""And fall in love with me.""

1609
01:20:30,856 --> 01:20:35,474
""We're the best.""
""We're the best.""

1610
01:20:35,817 --> 01:20:38,971
""The ghosts of Royal Mansion.""

1611
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:43,361
""The ghosts of Royal Mansion.""

1612
01:20:43,553 --> 01:20:46,021
""We're each other's friends.""

1613
01:20:46,061 --> 01:20:48,230
""We have no..""

1614
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:51,082
""We have no host.""

1615
01:20:51,152 --> 01:20:53,641
""We're filled with joy,
let's have toast.""

1616
01:20:53,869 --> 01:20:55,910
""We're the best.""

1617
01:20:56,041 --> 01:20:57,641
""We're the best.""

1618
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,364
""The ghosts of Royal Mansion.""

1619
01:21:00,463 --> 01:21:02,241
""We're each other's friends.""

1620
01:21:03,735 --> 01:21:04,735
Stop it!

1621
01:21:05,681 --> 01:21:06,681
What happened?

1622
01:21:06,798 --> 01:21:09,641
I was dancing.
What do you want?

1623
01:21:09,994 --> 01:21:11,281
Hold on.

1624
01:21:11,926 --> 01:21:13,441
Sir, Royal Mansion's in trouble.

1625
01:21:13,892 --> 01:21:15,761
What? What are you saying?
- Yes.

1626
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:18,213
We were living there
peacefully until now..

1627
01:21:18,425 --> 01:21:20,616
..because your
property was disputed. - Yes.

1628
01:21:20,824 --> 01:21:22,959
But the dispute is over.
- So?

1629
01:21:23,351 --> 01:21:26,049
Your great grandsons
have joined hands.

1630
01:21:26,503 --> 01:21:28,331
They have agreed on
out-of-the-court settlement..

1631
01:21:28,481 --> 01:21:30,774
..and they're selling
the mansion and mill.

1632
01:21:30,931 --> 01:21:33,299
What? What are you saying?
- Yes, sir, it's true.

1633
01:21:33,564 --> 01:21:36,514
They will raze
everything down and build a mall.

1634
01:21:36,554 --> 01:21:37,357
Mall.

1635
01:21:37,397 --> 01:21:39,392
You know all my male fans used
to call me a 'Maal' (hottie).

1636
01:21:39,512 --> 01:21:41,121
You're still one, sweetheart.

1637
01:21:41,584 --> 01:21:44,425
Manoranjana! Oh, God!
This is devastating news.

1638
01:21:44,554 --> 01:21:46,289
If anything happens
to the Royal Mansion..

1639
01:21:46,329 --> 01:21:48,001
..then I'll be homeless again.

1640
01:21:48,818 --> 01:21:50,541
If this had been the British rule..

1641
01:21:50,688 --> 01:21:52,900
..I would've hanged
this man to his death.

1642
01:21:53,005 --> 01:21:55,939
Soldiers,
we will give our life, boss.

1643
01:21:56,287 --> 01:21:58,347
But we will protect the mansion.

1644
01:21:58,559 --> 01:22:00,613
Idiot, you're already dead
how can you die again?

1645
01:22:01,145 --> 01:22:03,476
Let's first find out
who's the buyer. - Yes.

1646
01:22:03,619 --> 01:22:05,481
I think she has a point.
Who is this buyer?

1647
01:22:06,038 --> 01:22:07,927
Some builder called Bhooteriya.

1648
01:22:08,144 --> 01:22:09,866
Who told you?
- Technology.

1649
01:22:09,981 --> 01:22:12,385
I installed surveillance
cameras outside Royal Mansion.

1650
01:22:12,425 --> 01:22:13,062
Cameras?

1651
01:22:13,102 --> 01:22:14,875
And I just received
a MMS from that.

1652
01:22:14,943 --> 01:22:16,271
MMS.
- MMS. - See.

1653
01:22:18,197 --> 01:22:18,881
See.

1654
01:22:18,921 --> 01:22:20,001
That's Royal Mansion.
See. See.

1655
01:22:20,247 --> 01:22:21,476
Who's getting down from the car?

1656
01:22:21,516 --> 01:22:24,303
He's Bhooteriya.
He looks like a villain.

1657
01:22:24,343 --> 01:22:25,602
Yes, Manoranjana.

1658
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:31,905
Suresh bhai, thank you.

1659
01:22:32,138 --> 01:22:34,201
Ramesh bhai, congratulations.

1660
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,279
Bhooteriya sir, all yours.

1661
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,400
See, Guliyani.

1662
01:22:41,669 --> 01:22:43,764
When Bhooteriya sets
his eyes on something..

1663
01:22:43,804 --> 01:22:45,920
Yes!
- ..he always gets it.

1664
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:49,200
Yes! Now watch what
I do with this place.

1665
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:50,440
I will give it a complete makeover.

1666
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,920
But sir, what will you build here?

1667
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,480
I'll build a 5 floor mall.

1668
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:56,840
I've also thought of a name.

1669
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:01,098
Bhooteriya 5 Star Plaza.

1670
01:23:01,496 --> 01:23:03,440
Oh my god. What's this?
- It's run out of battery.

1671
01:23:03,605 --> 01:23:04,760
We'll go home and recharge it.

1672
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:07,311
Let's go to Royal Mansion. Follow me.
- Cadets. Comrades.. lets go.

1673
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,280
Oh, God. Look.

1674
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,320
Cheers.

1675
01:23:18,835 --> 01:23:20,840
Everything has been settled,
no problem.

1676
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,960
Cheers.

1677
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:24,557
Look at him. After giving us
pain they're drinking champagne.

1678
01:23:24,812 --> 01:23:25,951
We'll have to do something.

1679
01:23:26,053 --> 01:23:27,560
There's just one problem,
Mr Bhooteriya sir.

1680
01:23:27,798 --> 01:23:30,212
Heritage site status.
- No, sir.

1681
01:23:30,299 --> 01:23:32,320
There are two problems, sir.

1682
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,600
One is heritage site.

1683
01:23:34,668 --> 01:23:36,832
And second is... very big

1684
01:23:38,072 --> 01:23:40,840
Quiet. Ghost. Stop stammering.

1685
01:23:42,012 --> 01:23:43,012
Go.

1686
01:23:43,606 --> 01:23:46,120
Ask the architect to start work.
- Yes.

1687
01:23:46,383 --> 01:23:47,920
Tell him to make
the best construction.

1688
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:49,616
Mumbai will turn
into Shanghai later.

1689
01:23:49,656 --> 01:23:51,560
We'll build our own
mini Shanghai first.

1690
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:54,942
Stop!

1691
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:56,530
What the...

1692
01:24:01,417 --> 01:24:03,320
You're talking about
building Shanghai..

1693
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,720
..and the Municipality
doesn't have a clue.

1694
01:24:05,817 --> 01:24:09,234
So you're from the Municipality.
- No.

1695
01:24:09,325 --> 01:24:11,720
The Municipality is in my pocket.

1696
01:24:11,945 --> 01:24:13,129
Come here.
- Me?

1697
01:24:13,229 --> 01:24:14,920
Me... come here.

1698
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,920
Ma..ka..rand.
- Hey!

1699
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,320
Not Ma..kha..rand

1700
01:24:19,857 --> 01:24:22,886
That's Makhrand Marathe.

1701
01:24:22,926 --> 01:24:23,926
Maharashtrian.

1702
01:24:24,047 --> 01:24:25,840
The chief of Makad Company.

1703
01:24:26,095 --> 01:24:27,169
Get that?
- Yes.

1704
01:24:27,209 --> 01:24:30,320
Makad means?
- Makad means monkey.

1705
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:35,360
Ok. I was overhearing your
conversation quietly like a monkey.

1706
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:40,553
Is there a problem
with the heritage status?

1707
01:24:40,593 --> 01:24:42,139
No, no, no...

1708
01:24:42,313 --> 01:24:43,960
Say it. There's no problem.

1709
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:45,905
All your problems will be solved.

1710
01:24:45,997 --> 01:24:48,360
It's the rule of the world.
Give and take.

1711
01:24:48,818 --> 01:24:51,600
In the language of Makad
company you give and I take.

1712
01:24:52,002 --> 01:24:53,002
Name your price.

1713
01:24:53,527 --> 01:24:54,440
20...

1714
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,480
Lakh.

1715
01:24:55,534 --> 01:24:56,534
Quiet!

1716
01:24:56,938 --> 01:24:59,593
Look. 20 means 20 percent.

1717
01:24:59,633 --> 01:25:01,732
20 percent? Too much.

1718
01:25:01,864 --> 01:25:03,096
Don't try to be too difficult.

1719
01:25:03,136 --> 01:25:05,840
Otherwise it will take
just one bullet to kill you.

1720
01:25:06,294 --> 01:25:07,960
You have just one week.

1721
01:25:08,473 --> 01:25:11,363
Get me my 20 percent
and build your mall.

1722
01:25:11,813 --> 01:25:13,240
Makad's, let's go.

1723
01:25:15,123 --> 01:25:16,643
Guys, there's a twist
in the story.

1724
01:25:16,683 --> 01:25:19,003
Political twist.
- There's not twist.

1725
01:25:19,083 --> 01:25:20,563
He's a rich man.

1726
01:25:20,678 --> 01:25:22,603
He'll pay the 20 percent.

1727
01:25:22,683 --> 01:25:25,248
The politician will get what
he wants and we'll be homeless.

1728
01:25:25,288 --> 01:25:27,833
He won't be convinced so easily.

1729
01:25:28,083 --> 01:25:29,163
He's a businessman.

1730
01:25:29,243 --> 01:25:31,426
He'll negotiate till the end.

1731
01:25:31,599 --> 01:25:33,573
That means we have some time..

1732
01:25:33,723 --> 01:25:35,603
..and a window of opportunity.

1733
01:25:35,683 --> 01:25:38,203
But until then we
can't just sit idle.

1734
01:25:38,429 --> 01:25:40,843
Revolt. Bloodbath.
Charge.

1735
01:25:40,923 --> 01:25:42,563
No point in screaming and yelling.

1736
01:25:42,603 --> 01:25:44,083
Think of an idea, Bhootnath.
- Yes.

1737
01:25:44,243 --> 01:25:49,683
I am thinking to over feed
him the Bengali sweets..

1738
01:25:49,803 --> 01:25:51,203
..and he'll get high blood sugar.

1739
01:25:51,243 --> 01:25:52,483
And he'll die of diabetes.

1740
01:25:52,523 --> 01:25:54,723
That's a stupid idea.
Aatmaram, what do you say?

1741
01:25:54,763 --> 01:25:57,123
What can I say, sir?
I am a poor man.

1742
01:25:57,203 --> 01:25:58,919
Robin, how about you?

1743
01:25:59,123 --> 01:26:00,803
I feel we should give
him a sound thrashing.

1744
01:26:00,843 --> 01:26:02,603
You can't even play
your guitar properly.

1745
01:26:02,683 --> 01:26:03,843
How will you give him
a sound thrashing?

1746
01:26:03,963 --> 01:26:05,803
I'll play the guitar.
- Quiet.

1747
01:26:06,563 --> 01:26:08,283
Can I say something?
- Yes.

1748
01:26:08,443 --> 01:26:09,884
In the year 1857..

1749
01:26:09,983 --> 01:26:12,083
Oh no, Not again. Common yaar.
Oh god, Again!

1750
01:26:12,243 --> 01:26:13,243
Silence.

1751
01:26:14,243 --> 01:26:16,243
It's important, you
will have to hear it.

1752
01:26:18,043 --> 01:26:20,763
combat, battle, struggle and War.

1753
01:26:20,883 --> 01:26:23,963
The first stage is
always intelligence gathering.

1754
01:26:24,203 --> 01:26:28,563
When you find out
your enemy's strength..

1755
01:26:28,643 --> 01:26:30,585
..and weaknesses,
you've won half the war.

1756
01:26:30,625 --> 01:26:32,919
Then who will win half the war?
This shorty.

1757
01:26:33,416 --> 01:26:34,923
I am Khwaja Akbar.

1758
01:26:35,003 --> 01:26:36,845
Alias Khwaja Akbar..

1759
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:41,203
I've decided that I
will go to the builder.

1760
01:26:41,243 --> 01:26:42,363
I will spy on him.

1761
01:26:42,443 --> 01:26:44,443
And I will find his weakness.

1762
01:26:44,523 --> 01:26:46,803
By selling him pills?
- Not pills.

1763
01:26:47,146 --> 01:26:49,043
I'll floor him with my acting.

1764
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:50,403
I've done many plays.

1765
01:26:50,483 --> 01:26:52,763
French, Romans, Countrymen.
Ceaser

1766
01:26:56,183 --> 01:26:57,483
You bloody fool.

1767
01:26:58,209 --> 01:26:59,763
How dare you talk about
acting in front of Manoranjana?

1768
01:26:59,843 --> 01:27:01,843
I was always casted
without the couch. - Idea.

1769
01:27:01,923 --> 01:27:02,683
What? Say it.

1770
01:27:02,723 --> 01:27:05,683
To make our mission successful..

1771
01:27:05,763 --> 01:27:08,883
..we need a cunning
actor like Manoranjana.

1772
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:10,803
Cunning actress?
- I mean successful actress.

1773
01:27:10,843 --> 01:27:14,163
Thank you. - So Manoranjana,
get ready for the mission..

1774
01:27:14,283 --> 01:27:15,363
Mission Bhooteriya.

1775
01:27:15,403 --> 01:27:17,883
""Here comes the carefree ghosts.""

1776
01:27:22,015 --> 01:27:23,803
200 shops on 1 floor..

1777
01:27:23,883 --> 01:27:27,043
..which means 1000 shops
on 5 floors.

1778
01:27:27,563 --> 01:27:29,963
1 crore for 1 shop.

1779
01:27:30,227 --> 01:27:31,643
1000 shops...

1780
01:27:34,457 --> 01:27:37,243
1000...crores.

1781
01:27:37,438 --> 01:27:40,123
""Carefree ghosts.""

1782
01:27:40,363 --> 01:27:42,523
""Carefree ghosts.""

1783
01:27:42,794 --> 01:27:45,760
Bhooteriya the king.

1784
01:27:47,017 --> 01:27:48,043
Come in.

1785
01:28:03,776 --> 01:28:05,477
""I won't give it.""

1786
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:07,569
""I won't give it.""

1787
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:09,483
""I won't give it.""

1788
01:28:09,935 --> 01:28:11,678
Hi, I am Bhavna.

1789
01:28:13,286 --> 01:28:14,143
Bhooteriya.

1790
01:28:14,183 --> 01:28:15,563
Nice to touch you.

1791
01:28:17,286 --> 01:28:20,883
But without appointment
in my office..

1792
01:28:21,323 --> 01:28:24,803
If I had taken an appointment
then I would've been disappointed.

1793
01:28:25,243 --> 01:28:27,203
Good. Good.
You did the right thing.

1794
01:28:27,363 --> 01:28:28,363
You did the right thing.

1795
01:28:28,795 --> 01:28:31,443
What are you playing?
- Golf.

1796
01:28:31,738 --> 01:28:33,658
Will you play?
- Will you teach me?

1797
01:28:33,738 --> 01:28:34,738
Golf?

1798
01:28:34,978 --> 01:28:36,258
Sure. Sure.

1799
01:28:37,178 --> 01:28:38,258
Come, come.

1800
01:28:38,738 --> 01:28:39,738
Hold. Hold.

1801
01:28:42,378 --> 01:28:44,138
Now teach me.
- Yes.

1802
01:28:44,258 --> 01:28:49,098
In golf, the stick
should be hard and a good aim.

1803
01:28:49,258 --> 01:28:52,178
So that the ball goes
directly in the hole.

1804
01:28:52,378 --> 01:28:53,378
Like this.

1805
01:28:59,279 --> 01:29:03,258
Mr. Bhooteriya, yes!
I need a favor from you.

1806
01:29:03,427 --> 01:29:06,018
Flavor? What flavor?

1807
01:29:06,218 --> 01:29:08,138
""I won't give it.""

1808
01:29:12,077 --> 01:29:15,098
I want a space
in your 5 star Plaza.

1809
01:29:16,130 --> 01:29:18,618
But who told you about it?

1810
01:29:18,879 --> 01:29:21,458
We haven't even
started this project?

1811
01:29:21,863 --> 01:29:23,331
It's confidential.

1812
01:29:24,223 --> 01:29:27,099
I've hid it from everyone.

1813
01:29:27,418 --> 01:29:30,578
Don't worry,
even I believe in hiding.

1814
01:29:35,873 --> 01:29:37,178
Mr. Bhooteriya.

1815
01:29:37,438 --> 01:29:39,058
Mr. Bhooteriya.
- Yes.

1816
01:29:39,347 --> 01:29:41,138
I've lost my key.

1817
01:29:41,263 --> 01:29:43,698
Please find it.
- Yes, sure, sure.

1818
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:44,900
Why not?

1819
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,418
It's not..

1820
01:29:51,891 --> 01:29:53,091
Do you see it?

1821
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:54,578
I am trying.

1822
01:29:59,218 --> 01:30:00,218
Found it.

1823
01:30:00,456 --> 01:30:02,258
Found it?
- Thank you.

1824
01:30:03,323 --> 01:30:04,687
Thank you so much.

1825
01:30:06,898 --> 01:30:09,738
Will you give me space?

1826
01:30:13,178 --> 01:30:14,178
I will.

1827
01:30:14,318 --> 01:30:16,658
As much as you want.
- You are so sweet.

1828
01:30:17,038 --> 01:30:18,138
Oh no.
- What happened?

1829
01:30:18,392 --> 01:30:21,098
See, in a hurry
I brought my car keys..

1830
01:30:21,273 --> 01:30:22,818
..but I forgot to bring my car .

1831
01:30:23,131 --> 01:30:24,658
How will I go back?

1832
01:30:26,124 --> 01:30:28,962
Only if I let you go.
- Really?

1833
01:30:29,002 --> 01:30:30,002
Yes.

1834
01:30:30,595 --> 01:30:32,839
Now will you really give me space?

1835
01:30:33,986 --> 01:30:36,778
But what will you
give me in return?

1836
01:30:36,938 --> 01:30:38,418
Everything.

1837
01:30:39,288 --> 01:30:42,978
Head massage.
Shoulder massage.

1838
01:30:43,544 --> 01:30:45,218
Body massage.

1839
01:30:45,538 --> 01:30:47,178
Full sensation.

1840
01:30:47,815 --> 01:30:50,018
I will touch your strong points.

1841
01:30:50,941 --> 01:30:53,458
I hope you don't have a weak point.

1842
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:56,968
My wife.

1843
01:30:59,836 --> 01:31:01,236
Are you scared of her?

1844
01:31:01,596 --> 01:31:02,796
Yes.

1845
01:31:03,196 --> 01:31:05,276
I was scared of her
when she was alive.

1846
01:31:05,436 --> 01:31:07,996
Now that she's dead,
I am still scared.

1847
01:31:08,236 --> 01:31:09,316
She's dead?

1848
01:31:10,516 --> 01:31:14,186
Yes. That's why she haunts
me every night in my dreams.

1849
01:31:15,287 --> 01:31:17,824
What happened to her?
- Nothing happened.

1850
01:31:18,356 --> 01:31:19,506
I killed her.

1851
01:31:20,119 --> 01:31:22,837
What?
- I burnt her alive.

1852
01:31:24,116 --> 01:31:25,116
Why?

1853
01:31:25,396 --> 01:31:27,188
She nagged me all the time.

1854
01:31:27,956 --> 01:31:28,977
I had a chick.

1855
01:31:29,649 --> 01:31:30,802
Beautiful chick.

1856
01:31:31,516 --> 01:31:33,039
We were having an affair.

1857
01:31:33,756 --> 01:31:37,546
When Lakshmi found out
she was jealous.

1858
01:31:38,689 --> 01:31:42,926
I thought...let's get her
out of the way forever.

1859
01:31:44,917 --> 01:31:46,876
Then? - Then what?

1860
01:31:47,356 --> 01:31:49,810
One day when
she set out in her BMW..

1861
01:31:50,516 --> 01:31:53,956
..I poured petrol on the car,
and set it ablaze.

1862
01:31:56,436 --> 01:31:57,845
I miss her.

1863
01:31:58,818 --> 01:31:59,756
The wife?

1864
01:31:59,796 --> 01:32:01,761
No, the BMW.

1865
01:32:02,356 --> 01:32:04,120
It was worth 65 lakhs.

1866
01:32:04,996 --> 01:32:07,796
Actually,
Lakshmi's my weakness, Bhavna.

1867
01:32:07,993 --> 01:32:09,916
She doesn't let me sleep all night.

1868
01:32:10,076 --> 01:32:11,435
People are right.

1869
01:32:12,116 --> 01:32:14,116
Men become ghosts after they die.

1870
01:32:14,196 --> 01:32:17,079
But women are always a witch.

1871
01:32:18,434 --> 01:32:20,256
""I won't give it.""
- Bhavna.

1872
01:32:20,421 --> 01:32:21,756
""I won't give it.""

1873
01:32:21,836 --> 01:32:22,836
Bhavna.

1874
01:32:25,396 --> 01:32:27,556
So even though
Manoranjana was dead..

1875
01:32:27,636 --> 01:32:29,436
..she still entertained Bhooteriya.

1876
01:32:29,737 --> 01:32:30,436
Yes.

1877
01:32:30,476 --> 01:32:32,276
But only to know his secret.

1878
01:32:32,396 --> 01:32:34,476
But this Bhooteriya
seems like a dangerous man.

1879
01:32:34,556 --> 01:32:35,556
Exactly, sir.

1880
01:32:35,743 --> 01:32:37,850
And so, the ghosts of
Royal Mansion needs..

1881
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:41,556
..someone more dangerous than
Bhooteriya to teach him a lesson.

1882
01:32:41,683 --> 01:32:43,276
But where will we find such a man?

1883
01:32:43,356 --> 01:32:44,916
On Spookbook.

1884
01:32:45,076 --> 01:32:46,355
Spookbook?
- Yes!

1885
01:32:46,395 --> 01:32:48,476
It's a social
networking site for all the ghosts.

1886
01:32:48,556 --> 01:32:49,876
We'll definitely find someone here.

1887
01:32:49,956 --> 01:32:52,716
And their slogan is... ""Ghost.
Let's strengthen relationships"".

1888
01:32:52,933 --> 01:32:55,476
And they found the man
they were looking for.

1889
01:32:55,516 --> 01:32:57,793
He lost an arm when he was kid
while making a local bomb.

1890
01:32:58,156 --> 01:33:00,300
And since them people
started calling him Babu Hathkata.

1891
01:33:10,417 --> 01:33:13,716
What kinds of ghosts are you
that are scared of a gun?

1892
01:33:14,145 --> 01:33:15,860
If I don't take
this out before I sit..

1893
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:17,991
..then it pricks
in the wrong places.

1894
01:33:18,031 --> 01:33:19,676
Babu bhai, how are you?

1895
01:33:25,232 --> 01:33:26,236
Babu bhai, how are you?

1896
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:29,716
Uncle, don't try to be
too friendly.

1897
01:33:29,796 --> 01:33:32,156
Get to the business, who do
you want to get out of the way?

1898
01:33:32,437 --> 01:33:35,420
No mercy, no forgiveness,
all I need is one blow.

1899
01:33:35,577 --> 01:33:38,470
No, no, Babu bhai,
we're non-violent ghosts.

1900
01:33:38,552 --> 01:33:39,552
Non-violent ghosts.

1901
01:33:39,606 --> 01:33:41,276
You Idiot.

1902
01:33:41,816 --> 01:33:45,491
Did you call me here
to play the violin?

1903
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,796
Actually we're in trouble.

1904
01:33:48,127 --> 01:33:51,981
If you don't help us,
then my house..

1905
01:33:52,290 --> 01:33:53,916
This is a true war, mister.

1906
01:33:54,192 --> 01:33:56,152
And you'll receive merits for it.

1907
01:33:56,242 --> 01:33:57,712
Idiot, sit down.

1908
01:33:57,952 --> 01:34:02,103
Merits won't do.
I need hard cash.

1909
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:03,392
Babu, please.

1910
01:34:03,432 --> 01:34:05,352
We're in big trouble.

1911
01:34:05,472 --> 01:34:06,832
Help us, Babu.

1912
01:34:10,935 --> 01:34:15,837
This gorgeous girl
called me Babu, not brother.

1913
01:34:16,094 --> 01:34:18,336
So I cannot refuse her request.

1914
01:34:20,112 --> 01:34:21,712
Thank you Babuji bhai.

1915
01:34:22,112 --> 01:34:24,734
For helping us helpless ghosts.

1916
01:34:25,112 --> 01:34:26,338
You will earn merits for this.

1917
01:34:26,437 --> 01:34:27,530
Hey, uncle.

1918
01:34:28,112 --> 01:34:30,594
Keep your merits in your pocket.

1919
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:32,812
I did many good deeds myself.

1920
01:34:33,112 --> 01:34:34,858
I taught a boy to use the knife.

1921
01:34:34,898 --> 01:34:36,927
And he slit my throat one
day and dumped me in the drain.

1922
01:34:37,072 --> 01:34:39,200
Let's talk about money.
You can keep the merits.

1923
01:34:40,312 --> 01:34:42,178
Sorry, girls. I got too emotional.

1924
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:46,889
Don't worry. I will honor
you with a Queen's cross.

1925
01:34:47,232 --> 01:34:49,112
Who brought him here from London?

1926
01:34:49,192 --> 01:34:50,432
Did you pay his duty?

1927
01:34:50,632 --> 01:34:51,792
What did he just say?

1928
01:34:51,872 --> 01:34:53,512
He said you're a gem of a person.

1929
01:34:53,552 --> 01:34:54,632

01:35:03,792 --> 01:35:05,432

01:35:05,512 --> 01:35:07,792

01:36:00,137 --> 01:36:01,897
If you listen,
then you'll make profit.

Babu..

1969
01:36:30,403 --> 01:36:32,777
Rascal,
if you give 20% to Makhrand..

01:36:32,857 --> 01:36:35,218

This diamond got a knack of

01:38:18,843 --> 01:38:19,923
You said he is Richmond?

2013
01:38:20,003 --> 01:38:23,323

I see.
So the deal didn't go through?

2024
01:38:45,763 --> 01:38:46,643
The deal didn't go through..

2025
01:38:46,683 --> 01:38:48,363

budge from their offer.

2026

He's buying a property.

2052
01:39:53,523 --> 01:39:57,443
But it's been deemed
as heritage site.

2053
01:39:57,678 --> 01:39:59,123
Yes, yes, I know..

2054
01:39:59,311 --> 01:40:01,963
In the year..
- To hell with your years.

2055
01:40:02,187 --> 01:40:05,443
Now listen carefully
with both your ears.

2056
01:40:05,669 --> 01:40:08,523
If you don't cancel
that in two days..

2057
01:40:08,603 --> 01:40:10,483
..then you'll no longer be the CM.

2058
01:40:10,812 --> 01:40:12,443

So can I leave?
- No, no.

2064
01:40:20,763 --> 01:40:22,883
Bhooteriya, we don't
let our guests leave..

2065
01:40:22,963 --> 01:40:24,963

01:42:39,009 --> 01:42:41,403
""I am such a cutie, sweetheart.""

2094
01:42:41,897 --> 01:42:44,003
""My heat can melt ice.""

2095
01:42:44,198 --> 01:42:46,403
""I can melt you too.""

2096
01:42:46,682 --> 01:42:51,043
""If you touch me,
I'll fall in your arms.""

2097
01:42:51,495 --> 01:42:52,542
""Wait..""

2098
01:42:52,609 --> 01:42:56,436
""Strike that matchstick..""

2099
01:42:57,357 --> 01:43:01,963
""Strike that
matchstick and light the fire.""

2100
01:43:02,433 --> 01:43:03,433
""Come on.""

2101
01:43:04,998 --> 01:43:06,912
""Come on.""

2102
01:43:07,361 --> 01:43:08,739
""This girl's on fire.""

2103
01:43:08,856 --> 01:43:10,087
""She can take you higher.""

2104
01:43:10,161 --> 01:43:12,567
""She's your burning desire.""

2105
01:43:12,724 --> 01:43:14,763
""She's a burning desire.""

2106
01:43:14,843 --> 01:43:17,323
""She'll take you high.""

2107
01:43:17,761 --> 01:43:19,923
""She's a burning desire.
- She's on fire.""

2108
01:43:20,077 --> 01:43:23,000
""She'll take you high.
She's a burning desire.""

2109
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:24,040
""Hey man..""

2110
01:43:24,929 --> 01:43:26,483
""No mercy, or apology.""

2111
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:30,399
""All I need is one
blow to kill you.""

2112
01:43:32,756 --> 01:43:35,289
""I'll make you the
bullet of my pistol.""

2113
01:43:35,329 --> 01:43:37,563
""And fire all night.""

2114
01:43:43,177 --> 01:43:45,498
""I'll make you the
bullet of my pistol.""

2115
01:43:45,580 --> 01:43:47,577
""And fire all night.""

2116
01:43:47,617 --> 01:43:48,490
""I see.""

2117
01:43:48,530 --> 01:43:50,704
""I can pick you up with one hand.""

2118
01:43:50,816 --> 01:43:52,889
""Babu's very daring.""

2119
01:43:53,275 --> 01:43:57,883
""I'll make sure your story..""

2120
01:43:58,163 --> 01:44:02,883
""..has a happy ending.""

2121
01:44:03,942 --> 01:44:07,745
""Strike that matchstick..""

2122
01:44:09,072 --> 01:44:13,953
""Strike that
matchstick and light this fire.""

2123
01:44:14,155 --> 01:44:18,802
""Strike that
matchstick and light the fire.""

2124
01:44:19,253 --> 01:44:21,757
""You didn't need petrol,
or diesel..""

2125
01:44:21,926 --> 01:44:24,267
""Still she burned to ashes.""

2126
01:44:24,367 --> 01:44:28,959
""You struck matchstick
and lit her on fire.""

2127
01:44:29,512 --> 01:44:34,283
""You struck matchstick
and lit me on fire.""

2128
01:44:34,643 --> 01:44:39,003
""You struck matchstick
and lit me on fire.""

2129
01:44:39,635 --> 01:44:42,300
""You won't need petrol,
or diesel..""

2130
01:44:42,340 --> 01:44:44,652
""You set me on fire.""

2131
01:44:44,864 --> 01:44:49,923
""You struck matchstick
and lit me on fire.""

2132
01:44:51,623 --> 01:44:52,743
Lakshmi.

2133
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:55,263
Yes, Lakshmi, you rascal.

2134
01:44:56,783 --> 01:44:59,663
Lakshmi, but you were dead.

2135
01:44:59,743 --> 01:45:01,423
Dead, right?

2136
01:45:01,903 --> 01:45:04,283
But I am back as a ghost
to teach you a lesson.

2137
01:45:05,272 --> 01:45:06,863
Ghost. Ghost.

2138
01:45:07,783 --> 01:45:09,743
Save me, Mittal sir.

2139
01:45:10,063 --> 01:45:11,063
Help me.

2140
01:45:11,143 --> 01:45:13,211
No one will help you here.

2141
01:45:14,423 --> 01:45:16,703
Because we're all ghosts.

2142
01:45:25,023 --> 01:45:29,211
You rascal. You burnt me alive.

2143
01:45:29,581 --> 01:45:31,255
Now I will burn you alive.

2144
01:45:31,743 --> 01:45:33,143
You will suffer to death.

2145
01:45:33,223 --> 01:45:34,143
No, Lakshmi.

2146
01:45:34,183 --> 01:45:35,881
Don't forget I am your husband.

2147
01:45:36,143 --> 01:45:37,143
Your husband.

2148
01:45:37,183 --> 01:45:38,424
Husband.

2149
01:45:40,803 --> 01:45:42,143
Babu bhai, please save me.

2150
01:45:42,223 --> 01:45:44,023
Don't try to be too difficult.

2151
01:45:44,103 --> 01:45:46,317
Just die quietly. Get that.

2152
01:45:46,633 --> 01:45:49,103
Babu bhai, I made a mistake.

2153
01:45:49,183 --> 01:45:49,983
Forgive me.

2154
01:45:50,023 --> 01:45:51,515
Keep the money.

2155
01:45:51,659 --> 01:45:53,719
I'll send you 20 Cr. more.

2156
01:45:54,058 --> 01:45:55,103
Let me go.

2157
01:45:55,183 --> 01:45:56,383
Here you go.

2158
01:45:57,264 --> 01:45:58,983
I'll pour alcohol on his body..

2159
01:45:59,113 --> 01:46:01,583
..and you set his body on fire.

2160
01:46:02,943 --> 01:46:04,183
Stop, Lakshmi.

2161
01:46:04,482 --> 01:46:05,220
Let him go.

2162
01:46:05,260 --> 01:46:06,435
Let him go? Why?

2163
01:46:07,419 --> 01:46:09,383
You know what he did with me.

2164
01:46:09,463 --> 01:46:11,863
He's the reason why my
soul's wandering around.

2165
01:46:11,943 --> 01:46:13,103
Don't worry, Lakshmi.

2166
01:46:13,335 --> 01:46:15,503
I will support your wandering soul.

2167
01:46:15,583 --> 01:46:17,663
And if he doesn't, then I will.

2168
01:46:17,743 --> 01:46:19,703
And if he doesn't, then I'm there.

2169
01:46:20,015 --> 01:46:20,743
What?

2170
01:46:20,783 --> 01:46:22,263
Like a sister.

2171
01:46:23,727 --> 01:46:27,143
If we kill him then even he'll
start living her as a ghost.

2172
01:46:27,387 --> 01:46:30,103
And then he'll spoil
our time-table. - Yes.

2173
01:46:30,143 --> 01:46:31,103
She's right.

2174
01:46:31,143 --> 01:46:32,501
He's got loads of black money.

2175
01:46:32,863 --> 01:46:34,663
And those who have black money..

2176
01:46:34,743 --> 01:46:36,343
..always die of heart attack.

2177
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:39,663
If he dies a natural death,
he'll go straight to hell.

2178
01:46:39,831 --> 01:46:40,623
Simple.

2179
01:46:40,663 --> 01:46:43,150
Go, Bhooteriya sir,
we forgive you.

2180
01:46:43,463 --> 01:46:44,463
Thank you.

2181
01:46:44,620 --> 01:46:45,620
Thank you.

2182
01:46:45,663 --> 01:46:47,303
Thank you.
- Hey, smarty?

2183
01:46:48,219 --> 01:46:49,703
Do you think we're dumb?

2184
01:46:49,948 --> 01:46:51,235
Keep the bag down.
- Yes.

2185
01:46:51,275 --> 01:46:54,023
And send the other 20
which you just said.

2186
01:46:54,183 --> 01:46:58,663
Now get lost. - Wait Mr. Bhooteriya
You can't go like that.

2187
01:46:58,863 --> 01:47:00,520
Who is the boss? I am the boss.

2188
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:01,703
Who is the boss?

2189
01:47:01,863 --> 01:47:03,663
You are the boss.
- Yes.

2190
01:47:03,823 --> 01:47:06,463
So you'll be pardoned
only after hearing the boss.

2191
01:47:06,678 --> 01:47:08,223
Mr. Ramsay, play the music please.

2192
01:47:08,479 --> 01:47:09,983
Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

2193
01:47:13,263 --> 01:47:14,423
Friends.

2194
01:47:15,374 --> 01:47:16,543
Ghosts.

2195
01:47:17,682 --> 01:47:18,682
Human being.

2196
01:47:20,421 --> 01:47:25,436
You know...their
shopping malls, multiplexes..

2197
01:47:26,156 --> 01:47:29,823
..housing complexes,
high-rise towers..

2198
01:47:30,870 --> 01:47:32,783
..have deprived
the poor of the sun.

2199
01:47:34,564 --> 01:47:37,381
Because of them, the
sky's getting smaller..

2200
01:47:37,517 --> 01:47:39,484
..for the children
to fly their kites.

2201
01:47:40,524 --> 01:47:42,764
With the pointed
edges of their towers..

2202
01:47:42,804 --> 01:47:46,036
..they are piercing
the heart of the skies.

2203
01:47:47,608 --> 01:47:50,672
That's when it doesn't rain,
it doesn't rain.

2204
01:47:51,564 --> 01:47:54,628
And when it does,
it wreaks havoc.

2205
01:47:56,044 --> 01:47:58,995
There was a time when there
were huge homes in the city.

2206
01:47:59,244 --> 01:48:01,599
With huge courtyards, lawns.

2207
01:48:02,249 --> 01:48:06,249
But today...the common man
makes many sacrifices..

2208
01:48:06,289 --> 01:48:10,526
..and pays EMI and what
does he get in return.

2209
01:48:10,684 --> 01:48:12,644
A small pigeon coop.

2210
01:48:15,524 --> 01:48:17,742
By stealing each foot, they're..

2211
01:48:17,939 --> 01:48:20,279
..pulling the earth
from below the poor.

2212
01:48:21,484 --> 01:48:23,485
They have left no
place for a grave either.

2213
01:48:24,324 --> 01:48:26,666
Graves are getting smaller..

2214
01:48:27,164 --> 01:48:29,456
..that a person feels
suffocated even after he's dead.

2215
01:48:29,604 --> 01:48:31,484
Move aside. I feel suffocated.

2216
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:32,600
Move.

2217
01:48:33,244 --> 01:48:34,380
Forget humans.

2218
01:48:34,724 --> 01:48:37,017
They've even made the
lives of ghosts difficult.

2219
01:48:38,444 --> 01:48:39,987
How have we harmed you..

2220
01:48:40,244 --> 01:48:42,760
..that you want to
snatch our peace and serenity.

2221
01:48:47,324 --> 01:48:50,324
Only to fill your
banks with more money..

2222
01:48:50,404 --> 01:48:52,379
..why are you throwing
us out of our homes?

2223
01:48:53,284 --> 01:48:55,988
Without thinking where
we'll go, where we'll stay.

2224
01:48:56,884 --> 01:48:59,004
In dustbins, the public toilet.

2225
01:48:59,084 --> 01:49:01,329
Or in one of the
trial rooms in your mall.

2226
01:49:02,404 --> 01:49:04,537
If you keep
constructing these buildings..

2227
01:49:05,444 --> 01:49:07,684
..then one day the
earth will cave in..

2228
01:49:07,764 --> 01:49:12,328
..under the burden of
the iron, metal and bricks.

2229
01:49:12,964 --> 01:49:14,766
The world was scared of ghosts.

2230
01:49:15,404 --> 01:49:18,444
But now ghosts are scared
of these real-estate demons.

2231
01:49:19,403 --> 01:49:21,680
So tell me who do we complain to?

2232
01:49:22,244 --> 01:49:23,542
Who do we talk to?

2233
01:49:24,204 --> 01:49:25,204
No.

2234
01:49:26,804 --> 01:49:28,804
You cannot understand our pain.

2235
01:49:29,604 --> 01:49:30,924
You're human after all.

2236
01:49:32,164 --> 01:49:33,468
And humans these days..

2237
01:49:33,508 --> 01:49:35,364
..don't understand
another human's pain..

2238
01:49:35,444 --> 01:49:37,644
..so how can they
understand a ghost's pain?

2239
01:49:38,204 --> 01:49:39,284
Go.

2240
01:49:39,903 --> 01:49:41,004
Go away from here.

2241
01:49:41,265 --> 01:49:42,804
Leave us to our condition.

2242
01:49:43,133 --> 01:49:44,284
Take him away.

2243
01:49:44,324 --> 01:49:45,324
Go.

2244
01:49:45,444 --> 01:49:47,804
Son, you're fortunate.

2245
01:49:48,332 --> 01:49:49,444
Now get out of here.

2246
01:49:49,604 --> 01:49:53,475
No mercy, or apology.
One blow is enough.

2247
01:49:54,414 --> 01:49:55,452
Let's go.

2248
01:49:56,204 --> 01:49:57,325
Get out.

2249
01:49:57,604 --> 01:49:58,604
Run away.

2250
01:49:59,337 --> 01:50:00,337
Get out.

2251
01:50:18,004 --> 01:50:22,129
Aatmaram, will you take me home?
- Of course, sir.

2252
01:50:22,435 --> 01:50:23,435
I am a driver.

2253
01:50:23,484 --> 01:50:26,004
And a good driver picks
his guest from his home..

2254
01:50:26,084 --> 01:50:27,308
..and also takes him back.

2255
01:50:27,444 --> 01:50:28,964
What a nice thing to say?

2256
01:50:29,333 --> 01:50:31,524
Are you a ghost too?
- I don't know, sir.

2257
01:50:31,741 --> 01:50:33,183
I am a poor man.

2258
01:50:34,764 --> 01:50:35,684
Very, very interesting.

2259
01:50:35,724 --> 01:50:36,924
Thank you thank you.

2260
01:50:37,111 --> 01:50:39,284
I didn't get one thing.
- Yes.

2261
01:50:39,558 --> 01:50:41,444
How did the ghosts find Lakshmi?

2262
01:50:41,524 --> 01:50:42,524
Spookbook.

2263
01:50:42,644 --> 01:50:43,604
What? Spookbook?

2264
01:50:43,644 --> 01:50:44,724
Yes, just like Facebook..

2265
01:50:44,764 --> 01:50:46,164
..ghosts have Spookbook.
- Nice.

2266
01:50:46,643 --> 01:50:47,594
Bizarre Boss.

2267
01:50:47,634 --> 01:50:50,604
Lakshmi accepted Tina's request.

2268
01:50:51,027 --> 01:50:53,484
And also her offer to
teach Bhooteriya a lesson.

2269
01:50:53,564 --> 01:50:56,364
But sir, the main problem
was doing a hot item number.

2270
01:50:56,602 --> 01:50:58,308
Because Lakshmi was a simple,
homely lady.

2271
01:50:58,348 --> 01:50:59,444
She didn't know how to dance.

2272
01:50:59,592 --> 01:51:01,548
Got it, Manoranjana Kumari.

2273
01:51:01,647 --> 01:51:02,644
And Tina, sir.

2274
01:51:02,684 --> 01:51:04,804
They both trained her.
- What a concept.

2275
01:51:04,884 --> 01:51:06,404
What a concept.
- Thank you, sir.

2276
01:51:06,672 --> 01:51:09,364
And these ghosts taught a
nice lesson to Bhooteriya.

2277
01:51:09,949 --> 01:51:12,204
I guess he never cast an
eye on Royal Mansion again.

2278
01:51:12,284 --> 01:51:13,284
No, sir, he came back.

2279
01:51:14,065 --> 01:51:15,244
In fact the next day?

2280
01:51:15,824 --> 01:51:17,111
With a witch doctor?

2281
01:51:20,914 --> 01:51:22,797
With the original
papers of Royal Mansion.

2282
01:51:29,065 --> 01:51:32,465
Bhooteriya transferred the property
back to the ghosts forever.

2283
01:51:32,589 --> 01:51:36,278
And once again there was
happiness in Royal Mansion.

2284
01:51:45,305 --> 01:51:46,505
And on this joyous occasion..

2285
01:51:46,585 --> 01:51:47,905
..Gaindamal allowed Gulabchand..

2286
01:51:47,945 --> 01:51:50,265
..in Royal Mansion as well.

2287
01:51:50,505 --> 01:51:54,625
And Manoranjana Kumari and
Gulabchand were together again.

2288
01:51:58,878 --> 01:52:01,425
What a story.
- Sir.

2289
01:52:02,385 --> 01:52:03,225
Sir.

2290
01:52:03,265 --> 01:52:05,145
What a story.
- Thank you, sir.

2291
01:52:05,265 --> 01:52:08,265
It's got characters, plot points,
cinematic moments.

2292
01:52:08,345 --> 01:52:10,465
Crises, and now I've
the resolution as well.

2293
01:52:10,545 --> 01:52:12,825
And a hot item number too.

2294
01:52:13,705 --> 01:52:16,905
Raju writer,
you really are a writer.

2295
01:52:17,025 --> 01:52:18,025
Thank you, sir.

2296
01:52:18,225 --> 01:52:19,265
Thank you.

2297
01:52:24,265 --> 01:52:25,305
I like it. My friend!

2298
01:52:25,665 --> 01:52:27,265
I like it very much.

2299
01:52:28,505 --> 01:52:29,947
But brother, you see...

2300
01:52:30,825 --> 01:52:32,385
..our story is very nice.

2301
01:52:32,505 --> 01:52:33,929
Not just nice, it's sensational.

2302
01:52:34,665 --> 01:52:36,277
But there's a small hurdle.

2303
01:52:36,665 --> 01:52:38,892
Hurdle?
- Not too much.

2304
01:52:39,025 --> 01:52:40,585
Our story's a bit whacky.

2305
01:52:40,625 --> 01:52:41,785
It's a bit weird.

2306
01:52:41,865 --> 01:52:45,508
So the producer might hesitate
a bit to invest in this idea.

2307
01:52:46,128 --> 01:52:47,987
But I will manage.
I'll do it. Not to worry.

2308
01:52:50,105 --> 01:52:52,196
Sir, is that all?
- Yes, that's it.

2309
01:53:05,145 --> 01:53:07,967
What's this? - See it yourself,
you'll understand.

2310
01:53:17,025 --> 01:53:19,825
These are coins during the
East India Company rule.

2311
01:53:19,985 --> 01:53:21,345
They must be really old, antique.

2312
01:53:21,425 --> 01:53:22,745
Not just antique, sir.

2313
01:53:22,785 --> 01:53:24,345
They are worth a fortune.

2314
01:53:24,425 --> 01:53:26,236
Enough for you to start your film.

2315
01:53:27,057 --> 01:53:28,057
Keep it.

2316
01:53:28,105 --> 01:53:30,280
We'll arrange for the rest too.
- Hold on.

2317
01:53:30,585 --> 01:53:32,745
First you tell me your story.

2318
01:53:32,825 --> 01:53:35,020
After that you also
arrange for the finance.

2319
01:53:35,343 --> 01:53:36,595
What do you want?

2320
01:53:37,765 --> 01:53:40,026
Sir, I want to see a film
being made on my script.

2321
01:53:40,305 --> 01:53:43,003
Sir, since I grew conscious,
I had just one dream.

2322
01:53:43,871 --> 01:53:45,545
Someday I'll be a film writer.

2323
01:53:46,185 --> 01:53:48,236
And someone will
make a film on my story.

2324
01:53:49,919 --> 01:53:52,105
With this dream and 400 rupees..

2325
01:53:52,185 --> 01:53:54,185
..I came to Mumbai from Allahabad.

2326
01:53:55,731 --> 01:53:58,766
Fought with my mother
and angered my brother.

2327
01:54:00,044 --> 01:54:01,185
I was worried as well.

2328
01:54:01,945 --> 01:54:03,465
But I was confident.

2329
01:54:03,905 --> 01:54:06,564
I knew that someday my
dream will come true.

2330
01:54:09,992 --> 01:54:12,185
Slowly my dreams
started shattering..

2331
01:54:12,953 --> 01:54:14,305
..and so did my faith.

2332
01:54:15,563 --> 01:54:17,545
Everywhere I went with my story..

2333
01:54:18,030 --> 01:54:20,188
..all I would get is rejection.

2334
01:54:22,025 --> 01:54:23,896
Everyone said
""Raju, forsake this profession"".

2335
01:54:23,936 --> 01:54:26,095
You will only face failure.

2336
01:54:27,702 --> 01:54:29,905
But, sir,
I had heard a line in a play.

2337
01:54:30,808 --> 01:54:32,825
If a man has to be a failure..

2338
01:54:33,413 --> 01:54:36,985
..then it should be in
the work he wants to do.

2339
01:54:46,067 --> 01:54:48,545
You're successful now.

2340
01:54:49,694 --> 01:54:51,531
I am making a film on your story.

2341
01:54:53,208 --> 01:54:57,385
I am happy that I got
success at least after I died.

2342
01:54:59,231 --> 01:55:01,985
What?
After I died?

2343
01:55:02,865 --> 01:55:05,843
Sir, five months
ago I had no work..

2344
01:55:07,196 --> 01:55:09,240
..so I used to do
ghost-writing for many writers.

2345
01:55:09,588 --> 01:55:11,026
One day I was returning home..

2346
01:55:11,066 --> 01:55:13,145
..after finishing work.
And its raining heavily.

2347
01:55:13,457 --> 01:55:15,666
And I suddenly heard
a girl screaming.

2348
01:55:16,994 --> 01:55:18,065
Save me!

2349
01:55:20,305 --> 01:55:21,585
Save me!

2350
01:55:24,505 --> 01:55:25,505
Come on.

2351
01:55:25,665 --> 01:55:26,705
Come.

2352
01:55:27,264 --> 01:55:28,511
Who are you?

2353
01:55:28,905 --> 01:55:29,985
Come on.

2354
01:55:31,048 --> 01:55:32,048
Run!

2355
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:33,320
Run! Go.
Run!

2356
01:55:37,745 --> 01:55:39,065
Kill him..

2357
01:55:43,705 --> 01:55:44,825
Kill him.

2358
01:55:48,425 --> 01:55:50,105
And that is how I got killed.

2359
01:55:50,305 --> 01:55:52,465
I couldn't become a writer..

2360
01:55:52,585 --> 01:55:54,065
..but I definitely became a ghost.

2361
01:55:54,145 --> 01:55:56,385
After I became a ghost
I came to Royal Mansion.

2362
01:55:56,625 --> 01:55:58,682
Gaindamal sir gave me
permission to stay here..

2363
01:55:58,722 --> 01:55:59,820
..as a special case.

2364
01:56:00,727 --> 01:56:02,345
Then one day I wrote a story..

2365
01:56:02,505 --> 01:56:05,145
..about the joys, sorrows and
the sufferings of the ghosts..

2366
01:56:05,454 --> 01:56:07,145
..which I just narrated to you.

2367
01:56:10,512 --> 01:56:12,305
I must say you should start acting.

2368
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:13,985
You should stop writing.

2369
01:56:14,292 --> 01:56:16,047
That is how I got killed, sir.

2370
01:56:17,408 --> 01:56:18,785
You think I am joking.

2371
01:56:19,254 --> 01:56:20,894
I don't think. I know.

2372
01:56:20,987 --> 01:56:22,414
You're pulling my leg.

2373
01:56:22,614 --> 01:56:23,694
What's the proof?

2374
01:56:24,217 --> 01:56:25,037
You want proof?

2375
01:56:25,077 --> 01:56:26,526
Yes, I do.
- Come.

2376
01:56:54,094 --> 01:56:56,014
You want proof, don't you?

2377
01:56:56,814 --> 01:56:58,254
Curtain call, please.

2378
01:57:41,014 --> 01:57:42,294
Yes, Sumit.

2379
01:57:43,054 --> 01:57:44,974
Sorry, I fell asleep.

2380
01:57:45,054 --> 01:57:45,974
Very sorry.

2381
01:57:46,014 --> 01:57:48,854
You fell asleep,
but I am in a mess.

2382
01:57:48,934 --> 01:57:50,774
I had to travel in a
truck the whole day.

2383
01:57:51,214 --> 01:57:52,894
I guess I'll have
to give it a massage.

2384
01:57:53,014 --> 01:57:54,374
Let's go.
- Wait.

2385
01:57:55,414 --> 01:57:58,454
I just found out how
beneficial sleeping is.

2386
01:57:58,574 --> 01:57:59,654
How?

2387
01:57:59,894 --> 01:58:02,014
I heard a film story in my dream.

2388
01:58:02,303 --> 01:58:03,303
Almost a script.

2389
01:58:04,694 --> 01:58:07,534
Do one thing, go the
Guinness Book of World Records.

2390
01:58:07,894 --> 01:58:09,734
They will definitely
produce your film.

2391
01:58:10,014 --> 01:58:11,734
After all,
this will be the first film..

2392
01:58:11,774 --> 01:58:13,174
..which was written in the dream.

2393
01:58:13,668 --> 01:58:15,341
Give me a drag.
- Yes, sure.

2394
01:58:22,494 --> 01:58:23,774
What's this?

2395
01:58:28,934 --> 01:58:29,974
Aditya.

2396
01:59:14,374 --> 01:59:15,654
Number 1, take 1.

2397
01:59:15,734 --> 01:59:16,734
Clap.

2398
01:59:16,854 --> 01:59:19,074
And action.

2399
01:59:21,428 --> 01:59:22,428
Trolley.

2400
01:59:41,804 --> 01:59:44,445
""Here comes...
the carefree ghost.""

2401
01:59:44,602 --> 01:59:49,174
""Dance to the tunes of
movie songs, sweetheart.""

01:59:54,734 --> 01:59:57,767

Sallu and Shahrukh.""

""Ghost is no fool.""

02:02:00,269 --> 02:02:01,349
""Ghost is cool.""

""Ghost life is damn cool,
beautiful.""

00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:18,864
Hey Krishna... we still speak his name

11
00:02:26,316 --> 00:02:30,275
The blue-skinned boy
who tended his flock...

12
00:02:30,353 --> 00:02:34,050
He has many names,
he plays divine music

13
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:37,886
and he has been
worshipped down the ages

14
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:43,297
Such are the old legends
that have passed into folk tales

15
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,395
Hey Krishna...

16
00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:51,463
Hey Krishna... we still speak his name

17
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:55,341
Hey Krishna...

18
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:59,075
Hey Krishna... we still speak his name

19
00:02:59,316 --> 00:03:03,650
In a village on the banks of
Yamuna ... there it all began

20
00:03:04,688 --> 00:03:09,853
It was in those meadows his
flocks grazed and his flute played

21
00:03:09,926 --> 00:03:14,329
In a village on the banks of
Yamuna ... there it all began

22
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:18,333
It was in those meadows his
flocks grazed and his flute played

23
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:22,030
And the notes of his
flute rose in the air

24
00:03:22,272 --> 00:03:25,730
making melodies we so love to hear

25
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:26,935
of how little Krishna...

26
00:03:26,977 --> 00:03:29,775
won the hearts of men and
how he stole their butter...

27
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,681
and the songs tell of his strength,
how he moved mountains with a finger

28
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:39,316
Hey Krishna...

29
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:43,382
Hey Krishna... we still speak his name

30
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,918
Hey Krishna...

31
00:03:46,997 --> 00:03:50,831
Hey Krishna... we still speak his name

32
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:10,869
Butterfly...

33
00:05:10,947 --> 00:05:14,439
What is that thing?
- A rising storm?

34
00:05:14,517 --> 00:05:16,883
Look at it... coming in.
- Will it rain?

35
00:05:16,953 --> 00:05:18,853
Is it... the earth rumbling?

36
00:05:23,393 --> 00:05:27,261
Look at that cloud...
Let it rain, let it rain...

37
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,957
Not a raincloud...

38
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:31,794
A cloud of dust... armies?

39
00:05:34,304 --> 00:05:39,606
Armies...?
- Yes, it is an army

40
00:05:45,448 --> 00:05:47,882
Run... run for your lives... now!

41
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:51,580
The murderous Prince of Mathura!

42
00:06:00,764 --> 00:06:03,756
Go... run away, while you can...

43
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,529
Run...

44
00:06:18,415 --> 00:06:22,476
Chanur... Mustik... let the hunt begin

45
00:06:25,021 --> 00:06:27,581
It was the era of evil,

46
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:31,926
an age of sin

47
00:06:32,962 --> 00:06:35,453
Greedy kings and their
bloodthirsty armies...

48
00:06:35,532 --> 00:06:37,523
unleashed terror

49
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,001
and in the blood of
countless innocent people..

50
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:43,330
..this earth was drenched...

51
00:06:43,406 --> 00:06:49,504
and in songs and stories of those
who were wounded and made slaves,

52
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:53,572
the legends and
histories of this world were told

53
00:06:57,487 --> 00:06:59,648
Start the fires...

54
00:07:14,404 --> 00:07:16,235
Round them up

55
00:07:23,713 --> 00:07:25,340
Into the cages

56
00:07:32,355 --> 00:07:35,916
Please Prince, show us mercy...

57
00:07:37,293 --> 00:07:42,560
..do not take our food,
don't take our cattle...

58
00:07:42,632 --> 00:07:47,592
do not leave us to starve to death

59
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:54,633
Please, at least not our children...
please Mercy prince... mercy

60
00:07:57,313 --> 00:08:02,512
I am Kans... what I
fancy is mine to take

61
00:08:03,553 --> 00:08:05,817
Hurry!

62
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:59,566
Is there no end to our pain?

63
00:08:59,976 --> 00:09:03,673
When will this torture stop?

64
00:09:04,547 --> 00:09:08,278
When will You send us a savior?

65
00:09:08,718 --> 00:09:10,481
When...?

66
00:09:26,402 --> 00:09:28,461
Out of our way...

67
00:09:28,538 --> 00:09:31,336
The Prince is coming home

68
00:09:49,626 --> 00:09:52,288
Victory to Prince Kans

69
00:09:52,362 --> 00:09:54,956
Long live prince Kans

70
00:09:55,031 --> 00:09:58,626
Long live prince Kans
- Back to work, slaves

71
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:02,634
Don't drop the bag of cement

72
00:10:03,773 --> 00:10:05,297
Do work.

73
00:10:39,342 --> 00:10:47,442
My power is so great, my
rule will spread beyond Mathura

74
00:10:47,517 --> 00:10:50,315
And the whole world will
become the kingdom of Kans

75
00:10:50,386 --> 00:10:52,320
I shall shatter the peace of heavens..

76
00:10:52,388 --> 00:10:55,585
..and I shall
unleash the furies of hell

77
00:10:55,658 --> 00:11:00,652
and history will speak
of how I thrust my sword..

78
00:11:00,763 --> 00:11:03,732
..into the heart of the earth

79
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:06,860
This, the world's biggest stadium..

80
00:11:06,903 --> 00:11:09,929
..will become a symbol of my greatness

81
00:11:10,006 --> 00:11:14,306
If it is not finished by
the time of my coronation,

82
00:11:14,377 --> 00:11:17,574
then, you slaves will be buried
alive under the sands of this arena

83
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:20,878
And your bones will be
mixed with the concrete

84
00:11:27,924 --> 00:11:30,552
Put the new slaves to work

85
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:33,322
Double the working shifts

86
00:11:33,396 --> 00:11:35,728
And halve the rations

87
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,418
Kans' cruelty reflects...

88
00:11:56,486 --> 00:12:01,583
my failure as a parent

89
00:12:02,492 --> 00:12:05,290
In Mathura, I Emperor Ugrasen...

90
00:12:05,361 --> 00:12:07,921
stand reduced to a helpless father

91
00:12:07,997 --> 00:12:12,263
But Uncle, cousin Kans is so caring...

92
00:12:12,301 --> 00:12:15,964
he always remembers to bring me gifts

93
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:19,770
He is always worried
about my safety, protection

94
00:12:19,842 --> 00:12:24,302
I know, Devaki. But
I am afraid that...

95
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,377
after you're married
and gone from here..

96
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:30,509
..he might abandon all human values

97
00:12:30,887 --> 00:12:35,756
But please, you must never abandon him

98
00:12:36,492 --> 00:12:40,656
For he is to be the king of our clan

99
00:12:41,931 --> 00:12:44,365
I can only hope and pray that..

100
00:12:44,434 --> 00:12:47,892
..he doesn't destroy the other clans

101
00:12:48,337 --> 00:12:50,805
He is the sum total
of my fears, Devaki

102
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:55,842
It's a fragile peace
between warring clans...

103
00:12:55,912 --> 00:12:59,575
Your marriage with Prince Vasudev..

104
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:02,311
..promises to be the
first alliance for peace

105
00:13:02,618 --> 00:13:06,645
Eighteen warring clans will be united

106
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:13,495
This is the beginning of
my dream for a golden age

107
00:13:13,563 --> 00:13:14,928
But..

108
00:13:16,265 --> 00:13:17,596
Cousin Kans...

109
00:13:18,034 --> 00:13:20,502
it's got to be you

110
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,472
Devaki, you are the apple of my eye

111
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:28,038
But I find it so hard to believe...

112
00:13:28,277 --> 00:13:32,475
..that you are getting
married and leaving us

113
00:13:53,436 --> 00:13:55,370
Live a long and healthy life

114
00:13:58,307 --> 00:14:01,003
I had promised your father..

115
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:06,674
..that you will be given a
wedding fit for a princess of Mathura

116
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:09,775
I have fulfilled my promise

117
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,854
Akrur, won't you bless Devaki?

118
00:14:16,325 --> 00:14:18,452
Live happily

119
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:20,894
May you have mighty sons

120
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,801
Dear cousin...

121
00:14:30,573 --> 00:14:34,669
Everyone in Mathura
will miss you, Devaki

122
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,543
Vasudev...

123
00:14:41,984 --> 00:14:46,421
I give her to you. She
is as dear to me as life

124
00:14:47,323 --> 00:14:51,692
Therefore care for her as I have

125
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:56,330
Never bring her any sorrow

126
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,526
Her wish is my command

127
00:14:59,869 --> 00:15:01,302
Hey...

128
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,598
climb down

129
00:15:02,672 --> 00:15:05,800
I shall drive the bride's chariot

130
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:15,307
God bless Devaki and Vasudev

131
00:15:15,384 --> 00:15:18,842
God bless Devaki and Vasudev

132
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:22,357
God bless Devaki and Vasudev

133
00:15:22,425 --> 00:15:24,950
God bless Devaki and Vasudev

134
00:15:25,027 --> 00:15:28,258
God bless Devaki and Vasudev

135
00:15:28,331 --> 00:15:31,892
God bless Devaki and Vasudev

136
00:15:31,968 --> 00:15:35,597
God bless Devaki and Vasudev

137
00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:39,334
God bless Devaki and Vasudev

138
00:15:39,408 --> 00:15:42,605
God bless Devaki and Vasudev

139
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:18,839
Beware Kans...

140
00:16:19,382 --> 00:16:22,977
know this... the one whom
you are saying goodbye to...

141
00:16:23,452 --> 00:16:26,580
the eighth son of this very Devaki...

142
00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:29,453
will kill you

143
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:44,704
Her child will be my undoing?

144
00:16:44,774 --> 00:16:46,537
I cannot allow this
prophecy to be true...

145
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:50,375
..to let her son be born
so that he can kill me...?

146
00:16:50,446 --> 00:16:53,006
Never... never...

147
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:55,748
Devaki,

148
00:16:55,818 --> 00:17:01,313
forgive me, forgive
me my dearest cousin

149
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:11,898
Kans..?

150
00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:21,943
No Kans... no!

151
00:17:22,945 --> 00:17:27,439
If your life is to be the
cause of my death Devaki...

152
00:17:27,516 --> 00:17:30,542
..then in your death is my life

153
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:32,280
Kans, stop

154
00:17:32,955 --> 00:17:34,684
This is Devaki... she is a woman...

155
00:17:34,757 --> 00:17:36,622
..and she is your cousin

156
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:39,020
... and we are Just-married

157
00:17:39,562 --> 00:17:41,723
Holding a knife on her...

158
00:17:41,997 --> 00:17:45,023
..doesn't suit... a
great warrior like you

159
00:17:45,267 --> 00:17:48,725
It's her tough luck.
I must do what I must

160
00:17:48,804 --> 00:17:51,967
Then I am bound to
defend my wife, Kans

161
00:17:52,508 --> 00:17:54,305
And remember...

162
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:56,868
if I am forced to raise my sword,

163
00:17:56,946 --> 00:18:00,507
..then your clan and mine are at war..

164
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:03,677
..and my allies are
also at war with you

165
00:18:03,753 --> 00:18:06,244
Are you threatening me, Vasudev?

166
00:18:06,322 --> 00:18:07,687
No! He isn't threatening

167
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:11,883
Please! Have mercy upon us...

168
00:18:12,628 --> 00:18:15,222
Should I invite my death?

169
00:18:15,297 --> 00:18:16,958
No!

170
00:18:22,371 --> 00:18:24,737
Neither I nor Devaki
will cause of your death ...

171
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:27,275
..it is the eighth son

172
00:18:29,545 --> 00:18:30,944
I..

173
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:33,915
I give you my word...

174
00:18:34,283 --> 00:18:38,276
Each of Devaki's sons,
as soon as they are born,

175
00:18:38,788 --> 00:18:40,915
I shall give to you

176
00:18:43,526 --> 00:18:47,826
You are truthful and a
man of honor, Vasudev

177
00:18:47,897 --> 00:18:51,663
But as long as I am alive,

178
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:56,364
you shall remain my prisoner

179
00:18:56,739 --> 00:18:57,831
Soldier...

180
00:18:57,907 --> 00:18:59,670
As you wish, my Lord

181
00:20:05,574 --> 00:20:11,638
Kans has imprisoned his cousin..

182
00:20:11,747 --> 00:20:14,511
..and her husband

183
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,051
It's because of that prophecy...

184
00:20:17,286 --> 00:20:21,313
..that Devaki's
eighth son, will kill Kans

185
00:20:21,624 --> 00:20:28,792
How cruel of him... to throw a
newly-wedded couple into the dungeons

186
00:20:28,864 --> 00:20:32,925
How could he be so heartless...
this son of Ugrasen?

187
00:20:33,002 --> 00:20:35,402
The list of his
misdeeds grows longer...

188
00:20:35,471 --> 00:20:39,339
it's said that Kans
has angered his father

189
00:20:45,614 --> 00:20:50,347
This would've Qualified
for a death sentence..

190
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:53,950
..this betrayal borders on treason

191
00:20:54,857 --> 00:20:58,486
but a crown prince is given
a chance to defend himself

192
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:03,625
I shall defend myself by the
might of my sword, Your MaJesty

193
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:07,863
The blade that got rid
of Mathura's enemies..

194
00:21:07,937 --> 00:21:13,307
..will be my defense in
the face of your charges

195
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:18,403
What you have done is not
only unJust, it Is a sin

196
00:21:18,847 --> 00:21:23,284
Self defence is
every warrior's right...

197
00:21:23,352 --> 00:21:26,014
If that doesn't satisfy your Question,

198
00:21:26,288 --> 00:21:32,716
you may also retire to a prison,
to debate good and bad in peace

199
00:21:32,795 --> 00:21:35,764
Are you threatening me...
threatening your father...?

200
00:21:35,831 --> 00:21:37,890
How dare you threaten the emperor?

201
00:21:39,969 --> 00:21:43,871
Not threatening, dear Father...
I advise you to be careful

202
00:21:49,645 --> 00:21:54,378
Akrur, now I wish that
I never had this son...

203
00:21:54,817 --> 00:21:58,412
I am a total failure as a father..

204
00:21:58,487 --> 00:22:01,786
..Or, is he a punishment for my sins?

205
00:22:02,057 --> 00:22:05,686
Keep faith, Your MaJesty

206
00:22:05,761 --> 00:22:10,562
The night is darkest Just
before the beginning of a new dawn

207
00:22:33,022 --> 00:22:35,820
Who is more unfortunate than I...

208
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:42,723
..to spend my
wedding night in prison...

209
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:45,961
Nothing can happen
against God's will, Devaki

210
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:52,036
It is possible that this life is
prison may mean freedom for many

211
00:22:59,648 --> 00:23:03,846
What does Vasudev's
clan think of themselves?

212
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,387
For Vasudev's sake...

213
00:23:06,455 --> 00:23:09,652
they are willing to
pick a fight with you?

214
00:23:09,725 --> 00:23:13,525
If the stupid subJects of
our kingdom support this idea..

215
00:23:13,595 --> 00:23:16,723
..it can become a dangerous situation

216
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,728
Use the fear of an attack,
declare emergency...

217
00:23:22,805 --> 00:23:25,399
..in the name of
security of the state...

218
00:23:25,474 --> 00:23:31,310
and imprison everyone who
sympathizes with Devaki and Vasudev

219
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,406
And hang anyone who dares to oppose us

220
00:23:34,516 --> 00:23:37,417
Hang them

221
00:23:56,405 --> 00:23:59,033
Victory to King Kans

222
00:23:59,308 --> 00:24:01,902
Victory to King Kans

223
00:24:01,977 --> 00:24:04,707
Long live the king

224
00:24:53,395 --> 00:24:57,354
Your MaJesty, a holy
man wants to meet you

225
00:24:57,399 --> 00:25:01,358
A holy man? In the kingdom of Kans?

226
00:25:02,304 --> 00:25:05,501
I warned him that the king
has ordered all holy men..

227
00:25:05,574 --> 00:25:07,633
..to leave the kingdom

228
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,374
And...?

229
00:25:09,444 --> 00:25:13,972
He said, tell the
king that Narad has come

230
00:25:14,516 --> 00:25:17,781
Narad? Why did'nt you
tell me earlier, you fool?

231
00:25:18,253 --> 00:25:21,916
Narad is a devotee of
Lord Vishnu, my enemy

232
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,855
He is worth my time
if I can find out..

233
00:25:23,926 --> 00:25:28,863
..what Lord Vishnu
is plotting against me

234
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,497
Praised be the Lord

235
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:35,662
Praised be the Lord

236
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:45,678
A devotee of Lord Vishnu in
the kingdom of his biggest enemy?

237
00:25:45,981 --> 00:25:50,975
Are you so scared of me
that you have left him..

238
00:25:51,053 --> 00:25:53,544
..to Join me?

239
00:25:53,622 --> 00:25:57,786
One who sees God's
presence everywhere has no fear

240
00:25:58,026 --> 00:26:00,654
I have come to advise you..

241
00:26:00,762 --> 00:26:06,223
..that the very God you
want to fight lives within you

242
00:26:06,301 --> 00:26:11,534
All that lives
within me is my ambition.

243
00:26:11,607 --> 00:26:15,543
You are certainly a mighty king.

244
00:26:15,611 --> 00:26:18,580
But both the mightiest
and the wisest know that..

245
00:26:18,714 --> 00:26:25,779
the power of life and
death is in God's hands.

246
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,931
Your MaJesty...

247
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,497
I have come to make good my promise

248
00:26:44,273 --> 00:26:46,434
Here is my first born...

249
00:26:46,642 --> 00:26:48,269
my son

250
00:26:49,044 --> 00:26:50,841
I am unfortunate that..

251
00:26:51,747 --> 00:26:59,620
..I can not feel happy at his birth

252
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,224
Narad, you see...

253
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:07,490
The life of this baby is in my hands

254
00:27:07,562 --> 00:27:13,592
Nothing that you say
about morals can stop me

255
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:16,001
I can do whatever I want

256
00:27:21,243 --> 00:27:26,340
Bring me your eighth son...
I am waiting...

257
00:27:31,853 --> 00:27:38,258
I shall forever be
grateful for your kindness

258
00:27:38,994 --> 00:27:45,524
Now tell me Narad, who is more
powerful? Me or Lord Vishnu?

259
00:27:45,767 --> 00:27:51,296
As you can see, I even control Death

260
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:56,366
Such pride is not good Kans

261
00:27:56,445 --> 00:27:59,642
Lord Vishnu rules all creation

262
00:27:59,715 --> 00:28:01,910
Time also follows His design

263
00:28:01,984 --> 00:28:05,886
Oppose Him and you invite destruction

264
00:28:05,954 --> 00:28:08,388
While there is still time,
change your ways..

265
00:28:08,457 --> 00:28:13,451
..and seek forgiveness from the Lord

266
00:28:14,363 --> 00:28:16,991
For Kans, there is no God!

267
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:24,664
Kans rules Earth by his might

268
00:28:24,773 --> 00:28:29,233
Soon, I shall also conQuer
the skies and heavens...

269
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:37,514
and your Gods and you
god-men will all serve me as slaves

270
00:28:37,786 --> 00:28:41,882
Then instead of singing
the praises of the Lord..

271
00:28:42,324 --> 00:28:44,792
..you will all sing my praises.

272
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:50,889
Your ignorance is your misfortune

273
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:56,533
To protect His disciples,
to destroy the likes of you,

274
00:28:56,605 --> 00:28:59,472
The Lord has decided to assume
human form and appear on earth

275
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:02,942
That time is at hand,
and reJoicing has begun

276
00:29:03,345 --> 00:29:06,280
The Gods are
descending on earth as humans.

277
00:29:06,314 --> 00:29:11,911
In the time ahead, your
death waits. Mark, my words

278
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,688
But by the time you
realise your mistakes..

279
00:29:14,756 --> 00:29:18,317
..it will already be too late for you

280
00:29:38,814 --> 00:29:42,875
Your MaJesty, there's no
point in taking Narad seriously

281
00:29:43,485 --> 00:29:46,784
He's only good at twisting facts

282
00:29:46,888 --> 00:29:52,292
You are our emperor,
your life is precious

283
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,730
What value is a child's life,
compared to yours?

284
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:02,395
MaJesty, this waiting
for the eighth son means..

285
00:30:02,737 --> 00:30:05,262
..giving death seven
chances to cheat you

286
00:30:05,307 --> 00:30:06,706
But of course!

287
00:30:06,775 --> 00:30:12,042
Odds are, that the first son
could be as dangerous as the eighth

288
00:30:29,531 --> 00:30:33,934
I knew it! Kans can never be so cruel!

289
00:30:34,536 --> 00:30:36,800
I was the apple of his eye...

290
00:30:36,872 --> 00:30:40,774
that makes you his dearest nephew

291
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:58,323
Oh... it's you...!

292
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:06,426
His MaJesty has been kind...
has he come to set us free...?

293
00:31:06,501 --> 00:31:07,798
Yes!

294
00:31:09,304 --> 00:31:11,898
Has my son brought us our freedom...?

295
00:31:14,576 --> 00:31:18,410
Couldn't stay away
from the little one...

296
00:31:18,947 --> 00:31:20,676
..so I thought, let's pay him a visit

297
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:24,613
Yes, our son is so lovable..

298
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:28,485
I could keep on
looking at him forever..

299
00:31:28,823 --> 00:31:31,053
Look at him glowing,
like the full moon

300
00:31:31,293 --> 00:31:34,057
A good comparison...
your little one...

301
00:31:34,296 --> 00:31:37,595
is like the moon,
about to be eclipsed...

302
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:38,826
But... what...?

303
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,803
Your son and I are linked by destiny

304
00:31:43,972 --> 00:31:47,408
For me, he is death...
and I mean death for him.

305
00:31:47,475 --> 00:31:49,966
You said that you'd spare his life...

306
00:31:50,045 --> 00:31:52,036
..because, he's our first born

307
00:31:59,354 --> 00:32:02,482
In this lotus, which
petal is number one..

308
00:32:02,557 --> 00:32:05,492
..and which is the eighth...?
Who can say...?

309
00:32:06,294 --> 00:32:09,263
Clockwise, the first
is also the eighth..

310
00:32:09,297 --> 00:32:12,289
..counter clockwise the
eighth is also the first

311
00:32:12,367 --> 00:32:16,269
Any petal can be that number eight

312
00:32:16,304 --> 00:32:20,832
That's why each of your
sons can mean my death

313
00:32:21,443 --> 00:32:22,671
Give him up

314
00:32:22,744 --> 00:32:25,941
No... no...

315
00:32:26,414 --> 00:32:29,781
Spare my son!

316
00:32:29,851 --> 00:32:32,945
Don't...

317
00:34:31,806 --> 00:34:36,743
When the earth is scorched

318
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:46,378
sing a song of hope

319
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:52,622
For our darkest of times

320
00:34:53,695 --> 00:35:01,966
there's a song of hope

321
00:35:04,906 --> 00:35:08,501
For our world to be a nicer place

322
00:35:08,943 --> 00:35:12,606
For life without sorrow's traces

323
00:35:12,981 --> 00:35:16,576
For the darkness to be lit...

324
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:21,481
that the Sun may shine upon us...
Open your heart, let him in

325
00:35:21,556 --> 00:35:23,387
So let us reJoice...

326
00:35:23,491 --> 00:35:24,981
in prayer and songs

327
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,752
of love...

328
00:35:29,297 --> 00:35:30,992
So awaken, arise...

329
00:35:31,266 --> 00:35:32,995
make a wish and pray

330
00:35:33,268 --> 00:35:36,760
that He may come unto us

331
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:46,503
It is He, and he is coming
and our world is changing

332
00:35:47,282 --> 00:35:54,586
Open your heart, let him
in Feel the warm glow within

333
00:35:55,323 --> 00:36:02,422
Let Him in, let Him touch your heart

334
00:36:03,264 --> 00:36:10,693
Wipe your tears and feel the love

335
00:36:43,304 --> 00:36:47,308
Feel the love in hills and seas,
clouds of hope and rain

336
00:36:47,308 --> 00:36:51,574
Songs of birds and cricket's cheer,
let's fall in love again

337
00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:59,277
And once you've found peace,
you must make a wish...

338
00:36:59,387 --> 00:37:03,551
For him to be with you
and you with him, always

339
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:07,493
Sung in the music of the singing bees

340
00:37:07,562 --> 00:37:11,293
All songs of prayer, of hope, of love

341
00:37:11,366 --> 00:37:18,602
It's that someone, and he is
coming and our world is changing

342
00:37:19,307 --> 00:37:26,839
Open your heart, let him
in Feel the warm glow within

343
00:37:27,315 --> 00:37:34,687
Let it in, let it
touch your heart and smile...

344
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:42,856
smile and feel the
love... love... love... love...

345
00:38:15,263 --> 00:38:19,256
Give up sadness n despair,
go and speak the word of hope

346
00:38:19,334 --> 00:38:23,634
Tell them the world's changing,
tell em it's the power of love

347
00:38:26,341 --> 00:38:31,301
In faith and belief, hope and prayer,
sing songs of Joy and cheer

348
00:38:31,379 --> 00:38:35,645
it's the advent, it's Him, it's
the coming, the avataar of hope

349
00:38:35,717 --> 00:38:39,551
ln times of Despair,
nine times before, in nine...

350
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:43,387
ages of man, He was with us,
now He comes again

351
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:50,796
It's that someone, and he is
coming and our world is changing

352
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:58,669
Open your heart, let him
in Feel the warm glow within

353
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:06,812
Let Him in, let Him touch your
heart Wipe your tears and feel the love

354
00:39:07,348 --> 00:39:14,811
Let Him in, let Him touch your
heart Wipe your tears and feel the love

355
00:40:47,982 --> 00:40:50,815
Vasudev... Devaki...

356
00:40:51,552 --> 00:40:53,349
Do not fear

357
00:40:53,921 --> 00:41:00,850
You have worshipped
me for many lifetimes

358
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:04,728
Because of your devotion..

359
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:08,997
..I am to be born to you as a son

360
00:41:26,354 --> 00:41:30,051
Vasudev, do not hesitate

361
00:41:30,691 --> 00:41:32,886
Put me in a basket,
cross the river Yamuna..

362
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,360
..take me to Gokul, the
village of the cowherds

363
00:41:35,429 --> 00:41:40,492
There, find Nanda's wife Yashoda.
She has given birth to a baby girl

364
00:41:41,002 --> 00:41:45,871
Yashoda is tired and fast asleep

365
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,738
Put me down right beside her,

366
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:51,745
pick up her daughter
and bring her here

367
00:41:51,813 --> 00:41:54,441
Quickly now, Vasudev

368
00:42:14,468 --> 00:42:16,993
What a miracle this is, Devaki

369
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:20,468
At this darkest hour of night...

370
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:24,409
with the monsoon rains
wreaking havoc outside...

371
00:42:24,478 --> 00:42:26,639
we seemed to have no choice ..

372
00:42:26,747 --> 00:42:30,012
..but to witness the inevitable
murder of our eighth child...

373
00:42:30,618 --> 00:42:32,711
in such dire circumstance...

374
00:42:32,787 --> 00:42:34,846
our son has been born

375
00:47:50,004 --> 00:47:51,596
It's a daughter!

376
00:47:52,306 --> 00:47:54,365
My son would have
been a danger for you!

377
00:47:54,475 --> 00:47:57,876
Kill me if you wish,
but spare her life

378
00:47:57,945 --> 00:48:02,473
Spare her life, spare her life

379
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:09,479
Be it boy or a girl, Death never
differentiates. Why must I...?

380
00:48:10,758 --> 00:48:12,225
No Kans no...

381
00:48:12,293 --> 00:48:13,590
Please don't...

382
00:48:18,933 --> 00:48:20,958
Foolish Kans!

383
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:24,227
You will get nothing by killing me

384
00:48:24,738 --> 00:48:27,969
Your nemesis has been born

385
00:48:28,409 --> 00:48:31,708
The world's savior has arrived

386
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:34,544
God has descended on Earth.

387
00:48:34,648 --> 00:48:38,709
It's a certain end
for sinners like you

388
00:49:21,295 --> 00:49:25,789
Pootna

389
00:49:43,017 --> 00:49:49,252
Stay away! Stay away from me

390
00:49:53,794 --> 00:49:56,262
I'm bad and very evil

391
00:49:56,330 --> 00:50:00,289
Better be afraid of me

392
00:50:04,705 --> 00:50:09,836
Stay away! Stay away from me

393
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:12,274
I'm bad and very evil

394
00:50:12,346 --> 00:50:14,871
Better be afraid of me

395
00:50:14,948 --> 00:50:17,542
That's the venom..

396
00:50:17,618 --> 00:50:20,382
on my breath

397
00:50:20,454 --> 00:50:22,888
And the things I do...

398
00:50:22,956 --> 00:50:25,754
will drive you to death

399
00:50:25,826 --> 00:50:28,590
So keep the babies away from me

400
00:50:28,662 --> 00:50:31,927
I'm the evil woman

401
00:50:57,958 --> 00:51:00,654
I deal in black magic,

402
00:51:00,761 --> 00:51:03,958
evil spells,

403
00:51:08,702 --> 00:51:11,398
I deal in black magic,

404
00:51:11,472 --> 00:51:13,940
evil spells,

405
00:51:14,007 --> 00:51:16,601
evil spirits

406
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:18,871
even death

407
00:51:18,946 --> 00:51:20,413
I cast spells

408
00:51:20,514 --> 00:51:21,879
to kill babies

409
00:51:21,949 --> 00:51:24,474
I'm the mother of terror

410
00:51:24,551 --> 00:51:27,315
I have destroyed, uprooted,

411
00:51:27,388 --> 00:51:29,913
sent men to terrible deaths

412
00:51:32,726 --> 00:51:35,320
So keep the babies away from me

413
00:51:35,396 --> 00:51:37,921
I'm evil in every breath

414
00:51:37,998 --> 00:51:43,300
Stay away! Stay away from me

415
00:51:43,404 --> 00:51:45,736
I'm bad and very evil

416
00:51:45,806 --> 00:51:48,934
Better be afraid of me

417
00:52:09,897 --> 00:52:15,893
It's the poison in me that kills

418
00:52:19,873 --> 00:52:25,937
It's my poison that kills...

419
00:52:26,013 --> 00:52:31,315
the simplest who are seduced

420
00:52:31,385 --> 00:52:32,545
I cast spells

421
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:33,950
to kill

422
00:52:34,021 --> 00:52:36,455
I'm the mother of evil

423
00:52:36,523 --> 00:52:39,321
I have destroyed, uprooted,

424
00:52:39,393 --> 00:52:41,987
sent men to terrible deaths

425
00:52:44,798 --> 00:52:47,392
Stay away! Stay away from me

426
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:50,561
I'm bad and very evil

427
00:52:52,573 --> 00:52:55,007
That's the venom..

428
00:52:55,075 --> 00:52:57,873
on my breath

429
00:52:57,945 --> 00:53:00,539
And the things I do...

430
00:53:00,614 --> 00:53:03,378
will drive you to death

431
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:06,010
So keep the babies away from me

432
00:53:06,286 --> 00:53:08,811
I'm bad and very evil

433
00:53:18,298 --> 00:53:22,792
Pootna

434
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:27,898
Kans...? It's been so long...

435
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:49,385
O'mighty Kans, what
pleasures do you desire?

436
00:53:49,463 --> 00:53:53,627
My death has come in the form
of a boy, he must be killed.

437
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:55,793
Only one boy...?

438
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:04,536
A few hundred and it's
somewhat worth my time

439
00:54:04,578 --> 00:54:08,947
A few thousand means good money..

440
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:12,776
..and some Job satisfaction

441
00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:22,691
Fun for me begins... when I'm
counting in hundreds of thousands

442
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:25,288
But one child...?

443
00:54:25,365 --> 00:54:30,029
Mighty Kans, I am Pootna remember?

444
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:33,831
The one and only evil
witch with breasts..

445
00:54:33,907 --> 00:54:39,311
..that produce poison, not milk

446
00:54:39,513 --> 00:54:41,037
Poison

447
00:54:41,515 --> 00:54:42,846
Stay

448
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:49,416
My target is a lone baby,
but he is not an ordinary boy

449
00:54:49,523 --> 00:54:51,889
This is ordained

450
00:54:51,925 --> 00:54:58,797
So you have to kill all boys
born in the last ten days.

451
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:09,738
Now, I'll have some fun

452
00:55:35,335 --> 00:55:39,396
No! Don't take my baby away!

453
00:55:39,573 --> 00:55:42,906
Are there any more left?

454
00:55:55,278 --> 00:55:56,802
Welcome

455
00:55:58,114 --> 00:56:00,878
Thank you for coming

456
00:56:02,886 --> 00:56:04,319
Vrishabhan...

457
00:56:04,354 --> 00:56:06,015
Good to have you here

458
00:56:06,089 --> 00:56:07,556
Welcome, lady

459
00:56:07,824 --> 00:56:09,917
Congratulations on
the birth of your son.

460
00:56:10,227 --> 00:56:11,956
How is Yashoda?

461
00:56:12,028 --> 00:56:14,292
They're fine... please go inside

462
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:19,897
All well?

463
00:56:20,103 --> 00:56:22,162
The Lord is kind

464
00:56:22,272 --> 00:56:24,263
My congratulations , Nand

465
00:56:24,341 --> 00:56:25,433
Thanks

466
00:56:25,508 --> 00:56:28,568
I hope you too will have a baby soon

467
00:56:29,379 --> 00:56:32,439
We have been hoping for years

468
00:56:32,515 --> 00:56:33,607
And waiting...

469
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:36,114
We leave it in God's hands

470
00:56:36,186 --> 00:56:38,017
God will answer your prayers

471
00:56:38,088 --> 00:56:40,420
He always does

472
00:56:53,837 --> 00:56:57,534
Garg, you are wise
and can see the future

473
00:56:57,807 --> 00:56:59,138
Bless my son, give him a name.

474
00:56:59,242 --> 00:57:02,143
And tell us what the
future holds for him

475
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:19,121
How can I see the future of
a child who will influence..

476
00:57:19,195 --> 00:57:22,926
..the future of man till eternity?

477
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:25,300
Mark my words

478
00:57:25,568 --> 00:57:29,129
Born at midnight on
August's Wednesday..

479
00:57:29,272 --> 00:57:32,070
..that eighth night in the
cycle of the waning moon..

480
00:57:32,142 --> 00:57:35,339
..your son will find a
following amongst men..

481
00:57:35,545 --> 00:57:37,410
..as a shepherd to mankind.

482
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,210
He will lead men to a
higher consciousness.

483
00:57:40,283 --> 00:57:45,084
Therefore, I name him Krishna

484
00:57:51,361 --> 00:57:53,989
Krishna... my angel

485
00:58:01,905 --> 00:58:04,032
I'm going with you

486
00:58:05,408 --> 00:58:09,401
Balram, who will take
care of Little Krishna?

487
00:58:09,479 --> 00:58:12,312
When I am away, you will
be the man of the house.

488
00:58:12,415 --> 00:58:14,315
Krishna is Just a baby.

489
00:58:16,486 --> 00:58:21,583
I will settle the taxes in
Mathura and return soon.

490
00:58:38,174 --> 00:58:43,009
I have heard that a
demon is kidnapping children

491
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:44,603
Goodness!

492
00:58:44,848 --> 00:58:47,476
And the King is doing nothing about it

493
00:58:47,984 --> 00:58:50,782
Hey, keep an eye on Krishna

494
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:52,788
Sure, I will

495
00:58:52,856 --> 00:58:56,223
Don't let him out of your sight

496
00:58:56,292 --> 00:58:57,987
I won't

497
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,265
You were doing Just fine...

498
00:59:12,575 --> 00:59:14,543
what happened all of a sudden?

499
00:59:14,944 --> 00:59:17,970
All right hush, I'll call your mother

500
00:59:39,436 --> 00:59:44,373
Shut the door... my husband is away
and there's no man in the house...

501
00:59:49,379 --> 00:59:51,847
Who are you?

502
00:59:52,115 --> 00:59:54,879
I'm a celestial maiden

503
00:59:55,085 --> 01:00:00,113
I was passing by and I
saw your lovely baby

504
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:03,455
So, I stopped by to give my blessings

505
01:00:03,526 --> 01:00:06,518
As you might know..

506
01:00:06,796 --> 01:00:11,460
..demons are
kidnapping and killing babies

507
01:00:11,835 --> 01:00:14,895
My breast milk has the elixir of life

508
01:00:15,105 --> 01:00:18,506
If your son feeds at my breast..

509
01:00:19,008 --> 01:00:23,172
..no body will be able to harm him.

510
01:00:37,127 --> 01:00:40,460
Drink child, drink

511
01:00:41,097 --> 01:00:44,555
It's the elixir of life

512
01:00:46,236 --> 01:00:52,266
Just drink my milk and you
will be... free from life!

513
01:00:52,342 --> 01:00:56,904
Forever free...

514
01:01:05,388 --> 01:01:07,322
Let go of me...

515
01:01:08,558 --> 01:01:10,526
Let go of me...

516
01:01:12,495 --> 01:01:16,261
Krishna.. Somebody help!

517
01:01:24,841 --> 01:01:26,399
Somebody help!

518
01:01:29,078 --> 01:01:32,104
Looks like...

519
01:01:32,182 --> 01:01:37,347
..it's Krishna who
has got her instead.

520
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:39,411
Save my baby!

521
01:01:56,172 --> 01:01:57,764
Krishna...

522
01:02:00,043 --> 01:02:01,271
Krishna...

523
01:02:02,212 --> 01:02:03,509
Krishna...

524
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:05,042
Krishna...

525
01:02:05,515 --> 01:02:07,073
My precious little one...

526
01:02:25,435 --> 01:02:28,836
At long last... our
prayers are answered

527
01:02:29,439 --> 01:02:34,467
God has sent us a
precious little Jewel

528
01:02:37,313 --> 01:02:40,544
You can't imagine how happy we were

529
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:45,580
to find this pretty
creature lying on a lotus bed..

530
01:02:45,955 --> 01:02:50,824
..floating down the river

531
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:55,189
So beautiful, so exQuisite...

532
01:02:55,265 --> 01:02:58,996
My friend... tears in a time for Joy?

533
01:02:59,168 --> 01:03:03,434
I would've reJoiced at the birth..

534
01:03:03,473 --> 01:03:07,777
..but... it has been
eleven days since, and still...

535
01:03:07,777 --> 01:03:10,268
she has not opened her eyes...

536
01:03:25,028 --> 01:03:27,861
She has opened her eyes!

537
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:35,366
She opened her eyes
at Krishna's touch!

538
01:03:35,438 --> 01:03:39,465
Perhaps your daughter
didn't open her eyes..

539
01:03:39,542 --> 01:03:45,811
..because she wanted
to see Krishna first

540
01:03:46,282 --> 01:03:52,915
I want to name her Radha..

541
01:03:53,222 --> 01:03:58,819
..the first devotee of Krishna

542
01:03:59,128 --> 01:04:03,292
I don't understand this...

543
01:04:03,499 --> 01:04:08,459
how did an infant like
Radha recognise Krishna?

544
01:04:08,538 --> 01:04:11,939
Set your mind to it
and it defies logic.

545
01:04:12,008 --> 01:04:15,273
But seek within your
hearts and you may realise...

546
01:04:15,345 --> 01:04:18,508
theirs is an eternal friendship

547
01:04:18,848 --> 01:04:22,784
Your daughter Radha
is no ordinary girl.

548
01:04:23,319 --> 01:04:27,415
She is the feminine
expression of the Joy of life

549
01:05:27,283 --> 01:05:31,185
Trinavart

550
01:05:48,805 --> 01:05:54,835
Mighty Kans, what do you wish?

551
01:05:57,814 --> 01:06:03,480
Pootna never returned...
she's gone without a trace...

552
01:06:03,553 --> 01:06:05,817
Trinavart, now you are the
one who will kill the one..

553
01:06:05,855 --> 01:06:07,322
..who intends to kill me

554
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:08,823
This is my wish

555
01:06:08,891 --> 01:06:14,227
Nobody has survived my tornadoes

556
01:06:30,346 --> 01:06:34,942
May my Krishna's arms and his hands..

557
01:06:35,117 --> 01:06:40,521
..grow longer, stronger, faster

558
01:06:44,494 --> 01:06:50,160
May my Krishna's legs and his feet..

559
01:06:50,266 --> 01:06:55,294
..grow longer, stronger, faster

560
01:06:57,540 --> 01:07:02,000
And God protect you from the evil eye

561
01:07:51,928 --> 01:07:53,327
Help...

562
01:07:55,464 --> 01:07:57,796
My baby...

563
01:08:07,977 --> 01:08:10,878
It was strange that a child
should possess such strength,

564
01:08:10,947 --> 01:08:14,075
unimaginable that this
child would come to our rescue

565
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:17,278
It surprised all men
to hear such tales

566
01:08:17,553 --> 01:08:20,386
And thus came to be
Krishna's following

567
01:08:20,856 --> 01:08:23,586
It was strange that a
child could overcome such evil,

568
01:08:23,826 --> 01:08:26,920
unimaginable that this
child would challenge tyranny

569
01:08:26,996 --> 01:08:30,090
It surprised all men
to hear of his courage

570
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:33,363
... thus Krishna's
following came to be

571
01:08:46,349 --> 01:08:49,341
It was strange that a
child could overcome such evil,

572
01:08:49,418 --> 01:08:52,819
unimaginable that this
child would challenge tyranny

573
01:09:28,457 --> 01:09:29,890
My baby...

574
01:09:30,559 --> 01:09:34,518
Thank God!

575
01:09:52,815 --> 01:09:56,774
In our village every day

576
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,885
we have seen Krishna at play

577
01:10:01,323 --> 01:10:05,885
That lovely little boy...

578
01:10:05,961 --> 01:10:10,159
showed us how to move the moon

579
01:10:10,266 --> 01:10:14,464
Growing up amongst us,
he makes us think...

580
01:10:14,537 --> 01:10:20,339
if there can be a mystery
in every mischief we see

581
01:10:23,145 --> 01:10:27,514
We have seen him,
everyone has seen him

582
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:31,849
We have seen his miracles at play

583
01:10:31,921 --> 01:10:36,358
Oh, let him steal some butter

584
01:10:36,425 --> 01:10:40,953
Let him play his flute

585
01:11:07,089 --> 01:11:09,455
He's blue

586
01:11:09,525 --> 01:11:11,789
He's as Quick as deer

587
01:11:11,827 --> 01:11:15,786
And there's a peacock
feather in his crest

588
01:11:15,865 --> 01:11:18,129
He's always after pots of milk

589
01:11:18,234 --> 01:11:20,327
And he will thrash
anyone who tries to bully us

590
01:11:20,436 --> 01:11:24,463
We're glad he's here with us

591
01:11:25,007 --> 01:11:29,103
Glad to hear his flute,
glad to hear his song

592
01:11:29,178 --> 01:11:33,239
As glad as Radha is,
when she dances to his song

593
01:11:33,315 --> 01:11:37,149
In our village every day

594
01:11:37,486 --> 01:11:41,513
we have seen Krishna at play

595
01:11:41,991 --> 01:11:46,325
Oh, let him steal some butter

596
01:11:46,395 --> 01:11:50,991
Let him play his flute

597
01:12:17,092 --> 01:12:19,117
Just imagine that little mite...

598
01:12:19,195 --> 01:12:21,288
has the guts to put up a fight !

599
01:12:21,363 --> 01:12:25,561
Our Krishna is afraid of no one

600
01:12:25,835 --> 01:12:28,030
Even his worried mother smiles

601
01:12:28,103 --> 01:12:30,264
And when he laughs,

602
01:12:30,339 --> 01:12:35,208
in that ringing laughter hides,
the whole universe

603
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:42,044
Glad to hear his flute,
glad to hear his song

604
01:12:42,351 --> 01:12:46,117
As glad as Radha is,
when she dances to his song

605
01:12:46,255 --> 01:12:50,191
In our village every day

606
01:12:50,426 --> 01:12:54,522
we have seen Krishna at play

607
01:12:54,897 --> 01:12:59,163
That lovely little boy...

608
01:12:59,235 --> 01:13:04,434
showed us how to move the moon

609
01:13:24,326 --> 01:13:28,126
Where is that enemy of mine...
where is he?

610
01:13:31,467 --> 01:13:33,833
Pootna has disappeared

611
01:13:33,903 --> 01:13:35,962
Trinavart has vanished

612
01:13:36,038 --> 01:13:40,168
What strange powers protect him?

613
01:13:48,517 --> 01:13:53,318
Bakasur...

614
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:25,910
Look!

615
01:14:43,372 --> 01:14:46,808
Eat ! We have lots more

616
01:15:19,975 --> 01:15:24,105
Yashoda is such a
wonderful mother to her children

617
01:15:26,548 --> 01:15:32,487
Krishna is so full of mischief,
but she never loses her temper

618
01:15:41,930 --> 01:15:45,491
Duddy if you do as I say...

619
01:15:45,567 --> 01:15:50,903
we will get as much
milk to drink as we want!

620
01:16:10,859 --> 01:16:13,828
Look at the way she is walking!

621
01:16:13,896 --> 01:16:17,423
She is not walking, she is dancing

622
01:16:19,301 --> 01:16:25,433
Looks like she is
going to see her boyfriend

623
01:16:36,518 --> 01:16:40,579
She's so funny, I'm
nearly breathless... but ...

624
01:16:40,856 --> 01:16:44,952
does laughter also
leave you light-headed?

625
01:16:45,494 --> 01:16:49,863
I guess a good laugh
lightens your burden

626
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:02,470
Hey Krishna...?

627
01:17:03,545 --> 01:17:05,445
Run

628
01:17:05,514 --> 01:17:08,813
Yes, go on, run... hide where you can!

629
01:17:08,851 --> 01:17:13,481
Wait till I tell Yashoda...
all about these pranks...

630
01:17:13,555 --> 01:17:16,547
then she is going to take care of you

631
01:17:16,825 --> 01:17:20,955
Krishna you should..

632
01:17:21,029 --> 01:17:24,192
..sweet-talk your mother

633
01:17:24,299 --> 01:17:29,896
And get it over with
before these girls turn up

634
01:17:41,083 --> 01:17:43,051
Hey Krishna...

635
01:17:44,486 --> 01:17:46,420
Come here my darling...

636
01:17:46,855 --> 01:17:47,913
Come here

637
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:50,481
Why are you standing there? Come...

638
01:17:50,559 --> 01:17:54,120
Mother, I've made a mistake

639
01:17:57,166 --> 01:18:00,192
Mistake? What could my
little Krishna have done!

640
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:06,569
It's all this...
cream... and butter...

641
01:18:07,509 --> 01:18:11,309
Cream and butter?
What's this about? Speak up

642
01:18:12,014 --> 01:18:18,112
I've never seen such delicious cream
and butter in all my life, mother!

643
01:18:19,855 --> 01:18:26,055
You are not even seven years old
and you're talking about life?

644
01:18:27,563 --> 01:18:31,055
You see this cream
and butter every day...

645
01:18:31,233 --> 01:18:33,167
Can you give me a little mother?

646
01:18:35,938 --> 01:18:38,498
Not now. Wait a bit son,
don't be in a hurry,

647
01:18:38,574 --> 01:18:42,271
Be patient,
everything here is yours ...

648
01:18:42,844 --> 01:18:48,077
If you wait the reward will be sweeter

649
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:54,546
It's very difficult to wait
when it's right in front of you

650
01:18:54,790 --> 01:19:00,023
Krishna stop wasting time!

651
01:19:00,796 --> 01:19:02,787
Figure a way out!

652
01:19:03,432 --> 01:19:05,263
Those girls are right here!

653
01:19:10,839 --> 01:19:14,400
Mother I have a Question...

654
01:19:14,576 --> 01:19:16,407
So ask...

655
01:19:16,478 --> 01:19:18,878
First you say I've made a mistake.

656
01:19:18,947 --> 01:19:20,505
Then you say... this is the
most delicous cream and butter

657
01:19:20,582 --> 01:19:22,072
you have seen in your life...

658
01:19:22,150 --> 01:19:24,482
And now you say you have a Question?

659
01:19:26,188 --> 01:19:29,385
Mother am I not your son?

660
01:19:30,125 --> 01:19:32,150
Who has been saying this to you?

661
01:19:32,427 --> 01:19:34,588
You're my little darling

662
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:41,326
They all say you
bought me at the market.

663
01:19:41,370 --> 01:19:45,067
Tell me mother, am I not your son?

664
01:19:46,041 --> 01:19:48,805
The market? Who dares to say that?

665
01:19:48,944 --> 01:19:51,310
Tell me who ... let
them come in front of me!

666
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:55,180
Right! Very good! Krishna
deserves to be punished!

667
01:19:55,384 --> 01:19:58,012
Punished? Why would I punish Krishna?

668
01:19:58,086 --> 01:20:00,919
He destroyed our
milk-pots and stole the milk

669
01:20:01,223 --> 01:20:06,024
We have all the milk and
cream we'll ever need.

670
01:20:06,161 --> 01:20:07,788
Why would Krishna steal?

671
01:20:07,829 --> 01:20:09,797
Why would we lie, Yashoda?

672
01:20:09,831 --> 01:20:12,391
Do we enJoy complaining about Krishna?

673
01:20:12,467 --> 01:20:16,028
Yashoda, it was certainly him.
This beautiful complexion..

674
01:20:16,104 --> 01:20:22,236
..the headfull of curls, the
sweet mischievous smile...

675
01:20:22,311 --> 01:20:26,543
Who else could it be but Krishna?

676
01:20:26,815 --> 01:20:29,511
Mothet they're lying

677
01:20:29,818 --> 01:20:32,252
Look me in the eye and swear that..

678
01:20:32,321 --> 01:20:34,949
..you saw me breaking your pots
and then drinking the milk...?

679
01:20:41,563 --> 01:20:45,829
Yes! Krishna smashed my
milk and drank the pot...

680
01:20:46,335 --> 01:20:49,793
I mean smashed the pot and milk...

681
01:20:49,905 --> 01:20:52,806
No, no, no! The pot was in the milk...

682
01:20:52,874 --> 01:20:56,310
Oh God! What do I do?

683
01:20:56,378 --> 01:21:00,508
I want to say it... I can't say it...

684
01:21:13,562 --> 01:21:16,429
He made us brides
and confused the monkey

685
01:21:16,498 --> 01:21:20,127
No, no! Made the
monkey a bride and then...

686
01:21:20,235 --> 01:21:26,504
Oh I can't look at him... I
can't look away... What do we do?

687
01:21:26,575 --> 01:21:30,568
Krishna always puts us in his
spell and manages to get away.

688
01:21:30,812 --> 01:21:31,938
What do we do?

689
01:21:32,013 --> 01:21:33,139
Enough, enough

690
01:21:33,248 --> 01:21:35,808
You girls are blaming him for nothing

691
01:21:35,851 --> 01:21:39,514
Now go and take fresh
milk from the store. Go...

692
01:21:42,991 --> 01:21:48,224
Krishna you also go... you have
to take the cows to the fields.

693
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:46,803
Will you open your eyes, or
shall I open them for you?

694
01:28:40,475 --> 01:28:43,911
In the face of merciless persecution,

695
01:28:43,945 --> 01:28:46,971
in the face of violence, hatred,

696
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:02,789
deliver us from evil, oh Lord!

697
01:29:02,831 --> 01:29:08,997
Oh Lord, may Thy kingdom come

698
01:29:49,777 --> 01:29:51,938
Balram... there he is...

699
01:29:55,250 --> 01:30:00,552
This is what you call ''out
of the pan and into the fire''

700
01:30:01,022 --> 01:30:03,786
Find a blanket

701
01:30:06,995 --> 01:30:10,055
Krishna, Jump

702
01:30:10,798 --> 01:30:13,790
I am afraid...

703
01:30:13,868 --> 01:30:19,238
Don't be scared.
Jump! We're here for you

704
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:22,976
It is easy to say Jump
when you are standing there.

705
01:30:23,044 --> 01:30:29,381
Looking down from here all I
can think of is broken bones...

706
01:30:46,467 --> 01:30:48,992
Now what?

707
01:30:49,070 --> 01:30:52,801
Krishna Just shut your
eyes and take the plunge...

708
01:30:53,308 --> 01:30:54,434
No...

709
01:31:22,537 --> 01:31:25,529
Your destroyer has taken birth...

710
01:31:25,807 --> 01:31:29,436
Your death awaits you

711
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:32,911
The eighth born son
will be your end...

712
01:31:41,289 --> 01:31:42,381
MaJesty...

713
01:31:44,525 --> 01:31:46,823
Your MaJesty,

714
01:31:47,095 --> 01:31:48,824
But I've done nothing...

715
01:31:57,071 --> 01:31:58,368
Where is my destroyer?

716
01:31:58,439 --> 01:31:59,838
My destroyer... where is he?

717
01:32:00,041 --> 01:32:01,133
Why does he not reveal himself?

718
01:32:01,442 --> 01:32:02,966
Where does he hide?

719
01:32:03,344 --> 01:32:04,470
MaJesty

720
01:32:05,046 --> 01:32:07,014
He is merely a child

721
01:32:07,982 --> 01:32:11,110
And he has brought
you to this state...?

722
01:32:11,386 --> 01:32:13,854
I feel very pained to
see you like this...

723
01:32:14,222 --> 01:32:16,884
Pained? Then why
don't you do something?

724
01:32:17,191 --> 01:32:20,854
What is this magical
power protecting him?

725
01:32:20,928 --> 01:32:24,489
Who dares to be Kans' enemy?

726
01:32:24,565 --> 01:32:28,023
Who is this... so fearless?

727
01:32:28,102 --> 01:32:30,002
Excuse me, Your MaJesty...

728
01:32:30,438 --> 01:32:32,497
You are the one who sounds fearful

729
01:32:33,474 --> 01:32:36,500
Mighty Kans, this fear
is unbecoming of you

730
01:32:36,944 --> 01:32:39,412
Yes! I am filled with fear

731
01:32:42,884 --> 01:32:44,818
What a strange situation...

732
01:32:45,019 --> 01:32:48,250
the Mighty Kans is
afraid of a mere baby?

733
01:32:52,193 --> 01:32:57,460
However I ... I shall
surely overcome my fear

734
01:32:57,899 --> 01:33:01,767
I will conQuer death

735
01:33:02,036 --> 01:33:07,372
Wherever my destroyer
is I will destroy him

736
01:33:07,809 --> 01:33:11,540
I will annihilate him

737
01:33:11,779 --> 01:33:18,446
I will annihilate him

738
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:30,087
The Victor shall destroy

739
01:33:30,164 --> 01:33:33,930
with all his might, all
evil that stands in his way

740
01:33:34,035 --> 01:33:37,493
Only a ConQueror can overcome

741
01:33:37,805 --> 01:33:41,536
the demons that besiege him

742
01:33:49,050 --> 01:33:52,850
A Hero will rise to every challenge,

743
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:57,482
in the moment of truth,
he will hold his ground

744
01:34:28,789 --> 01:34:32,850
Come Judgment day,
holocaust and apocalypse,

745
01:34:32,927 --> 01:34:36,454
only the Hero shall save and redeem

746
01:34:59,854 --> 01:35:01,082
What is happening?

747
01:35:01,222 --> 01:35:05,750
Is this really an earthQuake,
or am I imagining it?

748
01:35:06,227 --> 01:35:09,253
What fears have overcome me of late?

749
01:35:09,330 --> 01:35:11,457
The hunt for this boy...

750
01:35:11,532 --> 01:35:18,062
has lasted for ten years and
still there's no a trace of him...?

751
01:35:18,139 --> 01:35:20,437
What's ten years, Kans?

752
01:35:20,508 --> 01:35:23,136
One can seek Him for centuries,
millenniums,..

753
01:35:23,211 --> 01:35:24,769
.. lifetimes and all ages of man...

754
01:35:24,812 --> 01:35:28,805
but you will see Him only
when He wants to see you

755
01:35:30,418 --> 01:35:31,885
Narad...

756
01:35:32,253 --> 01:35:36,087
If you know so much about that boy,..

757
01:35:36,357 --> 01:35:39,019
..you must also know where he is?

758
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:42,058
Ah... I know because
He wishes me to know

759
01:35:42,129 --> 01:35:43,994
And it is because of His wish that

760
01:35:44,031 --> 01:35:46,431
... this is the time for you to know.

761
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:51,802
Kans, your destroyer, Vasudev
and Devaki's eighth son, Krishna...

762
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:55,570
is in Vrindavan...in the
care of his foster parents

763
01:35:55,810 --> 01:35:58,278
Nand and Yashoda and
their son Balram...

764
01:35:58,346 --> 01:36:02,942
Vasudev and Devaki deceived me

765
01:36:05,386 --> 01:36:06,580
Akrur,

766
01:36:07,989 --> 01:36:12,085
I shall not rest in peace
until I have met my dearest nephew

767
01:36:12,426 --> 01:36:17,830
You must get to Vrindavan
Quickly and fetch my beloved nephew

768
01:36:17,898 --> 01:36:22,562
Invite him to the wrestling
matches in the arena of Mathura

769
01:36:22,937 --> 01:36:28,967
I have ached ten long, long
years to set my eyes upon him

770
01:36:29,844 --> 01:36:34,042
Let there be no delay. Depart, now

771
01:36:55,036 --> 01:36:56,162
Krishna...

772
01:36:56,304 --> 01:36:58,101
His Excellency Arkur
of Mathura has come...

773
01:37:01,375 --> 01:37:04,902
We are honored by your presence,
Your Excellency

774
01:37:05,446 --> 01:37:10,008
All my life, I have waited
eagerly to see You Krishna

775
01:37:10,318 --> 01:37:15,915
Here you are before me,
yet I cannot believe my eyes

776
01:37:17,224 --> 01:37:19,886
Krishna, my Lord!

777
01:37:20,161 --> 01:37:22,959
You are the one the world has awaited

778
01:37:23,030 --> 01:37:28,400
All creatures bright and beautiful,
all yearn for You

779
01:37:28,602 --> 01:37:33,562
Because each seeks divine love and Joy

780
01:37:34,975 --> 01:37:37,876
This world can provide kingdoms,

781
01:37:38,212 --> 01:37:40,544
and riches and wealth, eminence...

782
01:37:40,915 --> 01:37:47,411
But nothing worldly
provides Joy or bliss

783
01:37:48,022 --> 01:37:52,459
Of that eternal bliss,
You are the fountainhead

784
01:37:54,061 --> 01:37:59,931
To show us the path of
selfless devotion, of endless love,

785
01:38:00,368 --> 01:38:03,462
You come amongst us again and again

786
01:38:03,971 --> 01:38:11,002
When the world is
full of misery and grief

787
01:38:11,412 --> 01:38:15,246
You take mercy upon us ..

788
01:38:15,549 --> 01:38:21,078
..and descend amongst us to
lead us to truth and light

789
01:38:23,924 --> 01:38:27,917
Kans is a cruel king

790
01:38:28,496 --> 01:38:31,863
He has cast aside his duties as a king

791
01:38:32,433 --> 01:38:37,200
He is ruling Mathura
with the help of demons

792
01:38:38,072 --> 01:38:43,977
He imprisoned his father
and declared himself Emperor

793
01:38:44,378 --> 01:38:48,940
Eighteen tribes have been
forced to flee their homelands

794
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:50,512
And your parents...

795
01:38:52,019 --> 01:38:56,046
the torture that he has
inflicted upon your parents...

796
01:38:56,791 --> 01:38:59,954
In his attempt to eliminate you,
he killed your brothers,..

797
01:39:00,027 --> 01:39:02,996
.. six of them in cold blood

798
01:39:03,297 --> 01:39:08,792
I cannot describe to
you his cruelty in words

799
01:39:11,405 --> 01:39:13,999
All her life, your mother
could only weep helplessly for..

800
01:39:14,074 --> 01:39:16,804
..the children she has seen murdered

801
01:39:17,845 --> 01:39:21,008
And the unspeakable pain and sorrow..

802
01:39:21,081 --> 01:39:24,847
..that your father has lived with...

803
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:28,454
The time for my parents' freedom...

804
01:39:28,823 --> 01:39:31,883
and Kans' death has come

805
01:39:32,393 --> 01:39:36,159
It's high time that the
world is rid of this evil

806
01:39:36,831 --> 01:39:41,461
Kans is inviting
gladiators to wrestle in his arena

807
01:39:41,869 --> 01:39:44,167
He has invited you too

808
01:39:44,238 --> 01:39:47,537
To make a public show of
your death in Mathura's arena

809
01:39:48,776 --> 01:39:50,403
And I have the sad task...

810
01:39:50,478 --> 01:39:56,906
to escort you there

811
01:39:57,384 --> 01:39:59,477
There is no cause for worry,
Your Excellency

812
01:39:59,553 --> 01:40:00,884
What do you say, brother?

813
01:40:05,125 --> 01:40:10,028
Whenever I hear the flute...

814
01:40:12,867 --> 01:40:17,861
the lilting flute

815
01:40:18,138 --> 01:40:23,132
why am I overwhelmed,

816
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:25,801
why does my heart aches,

817
01:40:26,213 --> 01:40:28,443
why do my eyes yearn,

818
01:40:28,516 --> 01:40:31,007
why does my heart aches,

819
01:40:31,085 --> 01:40:33,815
why do my eyes yearn,

820
01:40:33,888 --> 01:40:38,825
oh why do tears come
to my thirsting eyes?

821
01:40:38,893 --> 01:40:49,235
Have you heard Krishna's flute,
have you felt the emotional tides,

822
01:40:49,303 --> 01:40:51,931
the heartache,

823
01:40:52,006 --> 01:40:54,770
my yearnings?

824
01:40:54,808 --> 01:40:59,802
Why does my heart ache,
why do I yearn so...

825
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:04,908
oh why do tears come
to my thirsting eyes,

826
01:41:04,985 --> 01:41:11,515
at the sound of the wind in a flute?

827
01:41:12,426 --> 01:41:15,827
Here amongst the
people of Vrindavan,..

828
01:41:15,863 --> 01:41:17,490
.. I have found that
love can be devotion

829
01:41:17,798 --> 01:41:19,197
I've found your love can be selfless,
devoid of any desire, ..

830
01:41:19,266 --> 01:41:20,927
..even wish or purpose

831
01:41:21,001 --> 01:41:27,304
Almost divine, such love
is boundless and full of Joy

832
01:41:35,049 --> 01:41:36,448
And you Radha...

833
01:41:37,051 --> 01:41:39,815
I am seeing in you love as
if in human form, personified

834
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:43,180
To tell the truth, I
can never love you...

835
01:41:43,257 --> 01:41:44,986
as much as you love me

836
01:41:45,259 --> 01:41:47,193
For love is a debt
that can never be repaid

837
01:41:48,062 --> 01:41:51,759
Forgive me, Radha.
Mathura is where I need to be

838
01:41:52,099 --> 01:41:54,294
There's a world
waiting for me out there...

839
01:41:54,768 --> 01:41:56,861
my destiny is calling me...

840
01:41:57,504 --> 01:42:02,373
Oh do not remind me
of times with you...

841
01:42:02,443 --> 01:42:07,847
I have stopped fighting those memories

842
01:42:08,182 --> 01:42:10,912
But why are you so pitiless,..

843
01:42:10,985 --> 01:42:13,146
..or is your music's
pleasure in making me sad?

844
01:42:13,253 --> 01:42:18,350
Will you ever return to me Krishna,
my friend, my foe...

845
01:42:18,425 --> 01:42:23,453
Have you ever heard His flute,

846
01:42:23,530 --> 01:42:28,797
passion's surge that music makes,

847
01:42:29,036 --> 01:42:31,436
the tortured heart...

848
01:42:31,505 --> 01:42:34,235
that brings tears to eyes...

849
01:42:34,308 --> 01:42:36,538
the tortured heart...

850
01:42:36,810 --> 01:42:39,108
that brings tears to eyes...

851
01:42:39,213 --> 01:42:44,344
Oh why do I weep

852
01:42:44,418 --> 01:42:51,347
Have you ever heard His flute,

853
01:43:22,222 --> 01:43:24,315
Attention!

854
01:43:24,792 --> 01:43:26,919
Our most beloved...

855
01:43:26,994 --> 01:43:30,486
our ruler and provider...

856
01:43:30,564 --> 01:43:32,122
the sovereign of Mathura...

857
01:43:32,232 --> 01:43:37,329
The King, Emperor,
The Almighty Kans...

858
01:43:37,404 --> 01:43:41,534
comes amongst us

859
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:48,311
And now...

860
01:43:48,749 --> 01:43:51,513
the Emperor's guests of honor...

861
01:43:51,952 --> 01:43:55,388
Devaki and Vasudev's son Krishna...

862
01:43:55,456 --> 01:43:57,788
and Balram...

863
01:43:58,025 --> 01:44:01,426
are entering the arena

864
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:09,531
My son... this is my son!

865
01:44:09,837 --> 01:44:11,236
My son has come!

866
01:44:11,472 --> 01:44:14,236
My Krishna... and Balram... at last...

867
01:44:15,776 --> 01:44:18,802
A team of two, this duo...
from Vrindavan?

868
01:44:18,879 --> 01:44:22,815
The whole town is full
with stories of their bravery

869
01:44:22,883 --> 01:44:25,147
But the two of them are Just children!

870
01:44:28,889 --> 01:44:31,949
So this is my destroyer?

871
01:44:36,830 --> 01:44:38,127
Chanur

872
01:44:40,334 --> 01:44:42,859
I am Chanur

873
01:44:43,036 --> 01:44:46,995
You must be Krishna...
and that is Balram

874
01:44:47,141 --> 01:44:49,473
Bravest of the brave?

875
01:44:53,447 --> 01:44:56,974
And I am Mustik. Which
one is taking me on?

876
01:44:57,050 --> 01:44:58,847
I think, my brother will

877
01:44:58,919 --> 01:45:00,511
Chanur is my opponent

878
01:45:00,754 --> 01:45:02,244
Accepted

879
01:45:16,870 --> 01:45:18,770
This is so unfair

880
01:45:18,806 --> 01:45:21,969
A boy pitted against a
killer like Chanur...?

881
01:45:45,833 --> 01:45:48,893
Shala, Toshala, Kut...

882
01:46:04,017 --> 01:46:07,817
Krishna...

883
01:46:12,092 --> 01:46:14,322
Krishna...

884
01:46:14,394 --> 01:46:19,161
Uncle here I am. You have been
looking for me for ten years...

885
01:46:19,266 --> 01:46:22,599
I accepted your
invitation and I have come

886
01:46:22,836 --> 01:46:25,430
When repression reaches its heights...

887
01:46:25,505 --> 01:46:28,406
it invites its own end

888
01:46:28,942 --> 01:46:31,536
You also have invited me

889
01:46:31,612 --> 01:46:32,909
Thank you for inviting me

890
01:46:50,831 --> 01:46:54,528
Krishna...

891
01:46:54,801 --> 01:46:57,565
Krishna...

892
01:46:57,804 --> 01:47:00,932
Krishna...

893
01:48:01,535 --> 01:48:03,503
This, for my six brothers...

894
01:48:03,570 --> 01:48:06,403
the six infants whom you
flung upon the rocks..

895
01:48:06,473 --> 01:48:08,805
and you bashed them until they died

896
01:48:09,476 --> 01:48:15,210
This, for my innocent parents,
whom you have held captive

897
01:48:21,421 --> 01:48:28,327
This, for the tears that my
mother held back for ten years

898
01:48:31,598 --> 01:48:36,865
This, for the eighteen clans
who were forced to flee Mathura

899
01:48:42,075 --> 01:48:44,942
This, for your
persecution of the people of Gokul,

900
01:48:45,012 --> 01:48:46,604
Vrindavan and Mathura...

901
01:48:46,847 --> 01:48:49,111
the countless people you have tortured

902
01:49:05,065 --> 01:49:09,502
This Avatar of Vishnu the Lord of
Life, who was born amongst us...

903
01:49:09,569 --> 01:49:12,402
and used his might to redeem us,

904
01:49:12,472 --> 01:49:16,909
to deliver us was called Krishna,
the son of Vasudeva

905
01:49:16,977 --> 01:49:19,571
Victory to Krishna!

906
01:49:19,846 --> 01:49:22,178
Victory to Krishna!

907
01:49:22,249 --> 01:49:24,809
Victory to Krishna!

908
01:49:24,851 --> 01:49:27,251
Victory to Krishna!

909
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:29,584
Victory to Krishna!

910
01:49:29,823 --> 01:49:32,417
Victory to Krishna!

911
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:37,854
People of Mathura, in
every era, in every age...

912
01:49:37,931 --> 01:49:39,865
this has been the fate of every tyrant

913
01:49:45,038 --> 01:49:49,236
Death to the tyrant add when
the statue of Kans is falling down

914
01:49:49,309 --> 01:49:53,177
Death to the tyrant add when
the statue of Kans is falling down

915
01:49:53,246 --> 01:49:57,307
Death to the tyrant add when
the statue of Kans is falling down

916
01:50:01,888 --> 01:50:04,448
Victory to Krishna!

917
01:50:04,524 --> 01:50:06,958
Victory to Krishna!

918
01:50:07,027 --> 01:50:08,995
My son... my baby...

919
01:50:09,062 --> 01:50:13,522
My Krishna... come...

920
01:50:19,106 --> 01:50:24,874
Krishna... my baby... I love you

921
01:50:25,445 --> 01:50:28,414
Mother, wipe your tears

922
01:50:29,082 --> 01:50:32,074
The time of sorrow is gone

923
01:50:43,497 --> 01:50:47,058
Say hail to King Ugrasen Hail!

924
01:50:47,134 --> 01:50:50,228
God bless Devaki and Vasudev

925
01:50:50,303 --> 01:50:53,500
Victory to Krishna and Balram

926
01:50:53,773 --> 01:50:56,469
Victory to Krishna and Balram

927
01:50:56,510 --> 01:50:57,772
5000 years on, the
legend of Krishna, his birth,

928
01:50:57,844 --> 01:51:00,108
his feats, still evokes awe,
inspiration, devotion

929
01:51:01,014 --> 01:51:02,777
The philosophy of duty and love that

930
01:51:02,816 --> 01:51:05,785
he espoused is the
cornerstone of culture

931
01:51:05,852 --> 01:51:07,786
in the land of his birth
and elsewhere

932
01:51:08,855 --> 01:51:09,787
this land seeking to
fathom Krishna's legend...

933
01:51:09,856 --> 01:51:11,118
and to re-live the music,
to study a culture...

934
01:51:11,191 --> 01:51:12,249
this Krishna consciousness
that has survived Tim
"
tt9248940,Dream Girl,"1
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,680
- Please.. Please..for my sake..
- No, I won't do it

2
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,200
Please..Karam..
Listen.. Just listen to me once..

3
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,040
Bro, I have failed again.

4
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,600
And the teacher has asked to speak with
my mother. Please help me out here.

5
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,320
- I won't.
- You can take my chocolates too.

6
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,040
Please..

7
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,240
- Seriously?
- Yes..

8
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,120
Okay, fine.

9
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,240
Hello Sir..
Smiley speaking, sir.

10
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,320
The one
who failed the tests miserably.

11
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,320
Sir please talk to my mother.

12
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,560
Yes..

13
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,320
Hello, sir.

14
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,160
What? He failed again.

15
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,080
Nothing to worry.
He will do better next year.

16
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,480
He's a Punjabi boy after all.

17
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,440
Even if he fails again,
there is nothing to worry about..

18
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,960
..we will sell a plot
and release his music album.

19
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,840
Fine. I'll hang up the phone now.

20
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,120
You're not dressed up yet!

21
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,000
All the other characters
are completely ready!

22
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,560
I am not going to play Sita.

23
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,800
I've told you before..

24
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,000
I can play Hanuman or Ram..

25
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,600
..but you are stuck only at Sita.

26
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,800
Make him Sita instead.

27
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,560
Huh..
Punjabi Sita.

28
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,960
Never.

29
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,800
You know how to mimic
a girls voice not me.

30
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,040
- Please..
- Stop. Stop..

31
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,720
Please don't say like this.

32
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,600
One last time.

33
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,040
Promise?

34
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,160
Swear on God.

35
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,080
I am not going to play Sita.
I've been saying it for years now.

36
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,280
Don't say that.
Just one last time play Sita.

37
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,040
Next time we'll manage
Ram Leela without Sita.

38
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,520
- Take it.
- Never.

39
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,560
Jambwant, Neel, Jatayu, I am
willing to do anything. But not Sita.

40
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,120
Brother. Mother Sita
is nowhere to be seen.

41
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,040
Ohh..

42
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,920
People don't come to see you,
but to hear your voice.

43
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,920
And all these rewards that you get..

44
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,600
..you will get them
as long as you play Sita.

45
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,560
And not otherwise.
Understood?

46
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,840
- Sita.
- Mother..

47
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,720
- Sita!
- Mother..

48
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,520
- Mom, when will mother Sita show up?
- Soon, son.

49
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,360
Here. Ask Jatayu to put
this on and get ready as Sita.

50
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,560
Wait. Bring it here.

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,720
Will you do it.

52
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,920
- Only till I get a job.
- Take this.

53
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,920
- Sita!
- Mother..

54
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,000
Lord..

55
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,680
Mother Sita has arrived.

56
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,680
Lord!

57
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,280
Lord, you are back!

58
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,240
- Glory to..
- Mother Sita!

59
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,160
Once more! Once more!

60
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,120
Mr. Jagjeet..

61
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,720
Mr. Jagjeet!

62
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,040
Yes tell me, What all do you want?

63
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,400
Incense sticks? Urn? Sandalwood?

64
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,880
Instalments!

65
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,840
Instalments?

66
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,360
How useless can you be?

67
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,560
This is no place
to ask for instalments.

68
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,480
- Instalment of bank loan.
- Which bank loan?

69
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,800
The loan that you
borrowed from the bank.

70
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,560
I've borrowed money from six banks.

71
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,680
The bank where you haven't
paid the last three instalments.

72
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,280
But I haven't paid back three banks.

73
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,560
The bank where you mortgaged
your home as collateral.

74
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,800
So be more specific, Mr. Mithilesh.

75
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,240
How else do you expect me to say it?

76
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,840
Everytime when I come here,
you refuse to recognize me.

77
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,600
Why don't you pay
your instalments on time?

78
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,240
You know what, Mithilesh,
come back day-after-tomorrow.

79
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,520
- Day-after-tomorrow?
- Yes.

80
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,440
Fine.

81
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,760
But the day after tomorrow is a Sunday.

82
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,920
What?
Day-after-tomorrow is Sunday?

83
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,160
How can this happen?

84
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,120
Then come back on Monday.

85
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,240
- Sure?
- Sure.

86
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,480
Can I pack something
for your family?

87
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,840
You are offering as if
you own a sweet shop.

88
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,080
- Brother, Radhe-Shyam.
- Radhe-Radhe..

89
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,000
Hey Karam..how about a selfie?

90
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,600
Thank you bro!

91
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,080
Radhe-Radhe, Karam brother.

92
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,960
Take mother Sita's blessings.

93
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,640
- It's his first day at the school.
- God Bless you.

94
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,360
Greetings, mother Sita.

95
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,680
What an amazing son,
and look at the father.

96
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,720
Mithilesh. Ride your scooter carefully.

97
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,080
Or it may happen that I'll wait
your money and you may never show up.

98
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,440
Finally, you are awake, Mother Sita.

99
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,840
Here are 11,500 rupees.
Go buy yourself a new mobile phone.

100
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,600
Your mother has put in so many
prayers to have you.

101
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,280
But you keep on playing female
characters in your plays.

102
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,640
Portraying the character of Sita
in Ramleela or Radha in Krishnaleela.

103
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,320
I don't care if you dress up as
one of the supporting male characters..

104
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,440
..but at least it
will make me very happy.

105
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,560
I wonder what your mother would
have said if she was still alive.

106
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,720
Even she was a female.

107
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,440
But you are a male.

108
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,240
Do you have any idea
how much debt I am under?

109
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,640
This home's mortgaged, the shop's
mortgaged, in fact, even I am mortgaged.

110
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,680
Except the blood bank you've
borrowed money from every bank.

111
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,880
Well, son,
borrowing money is not my hobby.

112
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,960
I don't like to go around
borrowing money for a pastime.

113
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,640
If you find a job, then only
will we be able to clear all the debts.

114
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,520
Yes. I am trying.

115
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,720
In fact,
I've given so many interviews..

116
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,480
..that if now anyone asks for
directions, I narrate my entire resume.

117
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,920
The results will be declared today.
I know I'll get the job.

118
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,640
I sure wish you do, son.

119
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,760
And listen..

120
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,600
Don't forget to wash your face first.

121
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,560
Doesn't look nice if mother
Sita keeps failing all the time.

122
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,200
Get off at the next stop.

123
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,240
Hey Karam?
Did you go to check your result?

124
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,200
Did you get the job?

125
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,640
Yeah..they want me to replace
Trump in the White House.

126
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,440
- Now take this bus tot he White House.
- Meaning no luck this time either.

127
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,840
Just give me the ticket.

128
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,400
Gokul-Mathura. Gokul-Mathura.

129
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,960
Anybody want ticket.

130
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,840
Give change.

131
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,680
- Please sit.
- No, I am absolutely fine.

132
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,760
All I do is sit at home all day.

133
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,280
- Sit.
- Yes.

134
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,520
Thank you, brother.

135
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,680
How many ticket you want?

136
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,520
'Salary 70,000 per month!'

137
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,120
These people always
litter government buses.

138
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,120
- Driver, stop the bus!
- What happened?

139
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,840
700..?

140
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,560
Demoted even before
I started the job.

141
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,880
Brother, where is 39-40?

142
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,240
Hey, ..this way.

143
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,120
Down here. Come down.

144
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,040
Hello. Coming.

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,200
Come.

146
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,560
Here you go. Now fix it.

147
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,200
- 70,000 rupees for fixing this.
- 70,000?

148
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,520
Fine. Come down and collect the cash.

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,800
And listen..

150
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,680
Don't feel embarassed if you
need anything else, Gunjan.

151
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,600
Okay. Okay..

152
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,040
Yes..
Is the inverter fixed?

153
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,840
He wants 70,000 rupees
for fixing the inverter.

154
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,400
I just went to the
washroom for two minutes..

155
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,000
..and inflation broke all the barriers.

156
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,000
Sir.. not that.
This..

157
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,720
So you are not the service person?

158
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,640
- I came for the interview.
- Interview?

159
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,840
- Yes sir.
- But we don't have any job for you.

160
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,480
Sir, I have a first class degree
even when I am a middle-class person

161
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,520
I've done my Bachelors
as well as Masters in Arts,

162
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,000
Even Masters in Philosophy.
Take a look.

163
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,520
Please..
I even know Croatia work.

164
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,080
I can make a dancing
peacock on a sweater.

165
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,720
Anything except for getting pregnant.

166
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,000
Please give me one chance.

167
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,680
- To get pregnant?
- To work.

168
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,200
Listen brother..we don't
want any peacocks to dance here.

169
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,320
- Please leave. Here you go..
- Please, sir..

170
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,280
- He's so importunate.
- I'll do it, sir.

171
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,760
- I said we don't have a job for you.
- I'll do it, sir.

172
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,040
- I said we don't have a job for you.
- I'll do anything..

173
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,960
- We don't have a job for you.
- I will do anything sir.

174
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,680
I will do it, sir.

175
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,960
Please sir..
I will do it, sir.

176
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,120
Come on.

177
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,120
It's bathroom. What kind of job, sir?

178
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,360
Come, let me show you.

179
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,240
See..See..take a good look.

180
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,400
I don't want a girl, I want a job.

181
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,480
I am not showing you the girl.

182
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,560
- Then?
- Come here.

183
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,240
Come.

184
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,520
Listen..Listen very carefully.

185
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,120
Hi, baby..

186
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,440
How are you?
You miss me after a long time.

187
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,040
Sweet talks..friendship..

188
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,840
..love calls.

189
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,680
This is a friendship call centre.

190
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Of course, I love you a lot.

191
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,720
Will you call me back tomorrow?

192
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,200
Of course, sweetheart.
We will meet someday.

193
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,760
Kissing and all is fine,
But don't misbehave with me.

194
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,000
Understand..

195
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,040
What are you saying sir!

196
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,320
You mean the electric
store is just a front face..

197
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,320
..but the real shocker
is the inner side.

198
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,200
- Understood right?
- Yes..

199
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,680
Now get out. Get out.

200
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,080
- Sir..
- What now?

201
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,240
Pooja has not turned up again.

202
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,120
And her phone's been
ringing continuously.

203
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Do you expect me to answer?

204
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,680
Transfer the call to someone else.

205
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,360
But he's her regular customer.

206
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,640
He doesn't talk to me, there's no
chance that he will talk to anyone else.

207
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,240
Spare me please.

208
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,560
We will meet later.

209
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,720
I must find a permanent solution
for Pooja.

210
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,400
- Lately she has been skipping work a lot.
- Hello.

211
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,560
I am Pooja

212
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,360
What happened?

213
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,800
Did't you like my voice?

214
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,080
You did, right?

215
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,160
Then.. let's continue talking.

216
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,240
you will like the conversations
even better, lover boy.

217
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,440
Bye, love you.

218
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,440
Tired?

219
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,520
Yes.. He was!

220
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,320
Bravo, my boy.

221
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,000
You raised the customer's
bill to 3000 rupees.

222
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,320
You are a very talented man.

223
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,240
But have no pride about it.

224
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,480
You sound so convincing as a female.

225
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,840
- How do you do it?
- It comes naturally.

226
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,920
What is this?

227
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,520
Advance.

228
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,120
You got the job, Pooja baby.

229
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,200
I get the job..
Me? Pooja baby?

230
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,320
Sir..Thank you, sir.

231
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,640
Sir..this will payfor all of my debts.

232
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,480
Read it first.

233
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,760
All I am doing for last 15-17
years is reading but to no avail.

234
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,520
Now I am just going to
write here, sir.

235
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,840
- Radhe-Radhe.
- Radhe-Radhe.

236
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,360
- Go easy on the betel leaf.
- Yes.

237
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,360
- Join the job from tomorrow.
- Of course, sir.

238
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,600
What a nice piece of advice for you?

239
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,200
Shut your mouth.

240
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,840
What do you want..

241
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,600
You?

242
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,640
Come inside.

243
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,480
Hurry up.

244
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,720
Why didn't you come
to the Ramleela yesterday?

245
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,080
Today is a dry day.

246
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,760
I sold so many bottles yesterday..

247
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,040
..that I had to give
my personal bottles in the end.

248
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,320
Before going to bed
I had to take milk instead.

249
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,480
""Alcohol consumption
is injurious to health.""

250
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,960
Delivery's closed. You'll
have to collect it yourself today.

251
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,360
Already here?

252
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,760
That's pretty fast.

253
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,960
What do you..

254
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,760
- What's wrong, uncle?
- Come on, out with it.

255
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,640
No alcohol on a dry day, sir.

256
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,760
I've warned you not to
open your shop on dry days.

257
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,000
- But..
- But you never understand.

258
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,000
- Now pay the fine.
- The shop's closed.

259
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,800
I am with my girlfriend.

260
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
Girlfriend?
What's your girlfriend doing here?

261
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,360
Unfortunately,
uncle, we can't go to her place..

262
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,560
..and I don't have
a mattress at my place.

263
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,680
Now you tell me what should I do.

264
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,240
- Try to understand.
- Who is it, darling?

265
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,120
Police, baby..

266
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,480
First, they used to raid the hotels,
now they are raiding wine shops too.

267
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,560
And I can't even reach
the hook of my blouse.

268
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,000
Yes, I'll help you.

269
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,040
See sir..

270
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,560
I can't see a thing.

271
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,000
Why don't you buy a mattress at home.

272
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,400
I will, at Diwali.

273
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,080
Don't forget.
Let's go.

274
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,040
Don't you dare open the shop.

275
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,080
Bro..your voice saved us again.

276
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,480
Stop talking..

277
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,760
Open a beer.

278
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,040
You seem to be in a very good mood.

279
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,480
I got a job in Faridabad.

280
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,400
You shouldn't be lying on a dry day.

281
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,520
Drunkards will curse you.
Don't do it.

282
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,920
Look..25,000 advance.

283
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,560
Awsome !!

284
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,200
We're going to drink until we drop.
The party's on me.

285
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,000
Uncle, you're back?

286
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,000
I go out for one day..

287
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,080
..and you turn my
place into hell.

288
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,680
We were just enjoying, uncle.

289
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,920
This isn't enjoyment... it's debauchery.

290
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,760
Uncle..debauchery would be if you had
found us in the arms of some Russian gals.

291
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,560
We were enjoying because
my friend here, got a job.

292
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,320
If you are still high from last night,
then spray some acid on your face.

293
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,320
He is right, Dad. I got a job.

294
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,160
Heard that..
- Look..

295
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,920
25,000 advance.

296
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,880
Bless me.

297
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,080
Radhe-Radhe.
God Bless you, son.

298
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,760
- 25,000 advance.
- Yes.

299
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,240
Which company gives so much advance?

300
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,080
That is the issue,
when people earning 2500..

301
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,240
..get 25000 in their hands,
they tend to loose their mind.

302
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,760
Shut up.

303
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,080
Go away..

304
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,040
Which company?

305
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,240
Call Cent..

306
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,600
Colgate. Colgate Colgate company.

307
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,240
Radhe-Radhe. It's a very good news..

308
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,320
..now I can repay my debts
and also get free toothpaste.

309
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,680
- There are only two problems
in your life, dad. - What?

310
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,520
Loan and Alone!

311
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,520
And we need to decrease your interest
in one and increase in the other.

312
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,280
Let's find you a beautiful
bride and get you married.

313
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,520
Don't be crazy.

314
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,840
You are old enough to get married now.

315
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,960
You are not that old yet.

316
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,160
If we don't count the public
holidays then you'll still be 26.

317
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,400
Bro, you should love
your dad and not mislead him.

318
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,560
Am I right, uncle.

319
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,680
Be quiet.

320
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,440
- Uncle, love you too.
- Mr. Jagjeet.

321
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,040
- Yes.
- There is someone at the shop.

322
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,480
Go take a look.
Must be from the Thakur family.

323
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,360
What will it take to
get a cup of tea around here?

324
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,280
Shut up, you stupid.

325
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,920
You made me forget the count..

326
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,120
500..1000..

327
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,280
Here is all your stuff.

328
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,400
2250 rupees.

329
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,160
I forgot my wallet at home.

330
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,480
We take PayTm as well.

331
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,000
What is PayTm?

332
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,640
So naive.

333
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,280
Do you know that there's a new 2000
currency note in the market?

334
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,880
I am not that naive.

335
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,120
Hello.
I am on my way back.

336
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Did you pack camphor (Kapoor)?

337
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,320
Here.

338
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,880
20 rupees.

339
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,120
So cheap.

340
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,480
Not every Kapoor is Ranbir Kapoor.

341
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,920
Total 2270 rupees.

342
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,200
Take it.

343
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,840
It's too much for one man to carry.

344
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,560
Help me deliver this stuff
and collect your money as well.

345
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,880
Grandpa...

346
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,560
- Slowdown!
- Mourning again

347
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,040
I am just the delivery guy.

348
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,480
- I see..
- Hello.

349
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,640
Hello.

350
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,280
Come.

351
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,440
[sankrit chants]

352
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,720
Hello.

353
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,200
Deepak.

354
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,040
Pay his bill.

355
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,560
Hari. This isn't spicy enough.

356
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,000
Bring some more chilly.

357
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,360
Who is the old lady?

358
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,440
She is the Thakur's wife, do you know?

359
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,480
No..

360
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,520
Does she know her
husband has passed away?

361
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,840
Yes, she does.

362
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,720
But grandpa had turned 95.

363
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,880
Which is why she
isn't wailing or crying?

364
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,000
No! I will go..

365
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,680
I don't believe in such nonsense.

366
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,400
Grandma..what is she talking about?

367
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,640
I am going to the crematorium,
and that's it.

368
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,520
I don't want to listen.
I am coming downstairs.

369
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,920
Mahi.. stop!

370
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,560
What's the name?

371
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,800
Mahinder.

372
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,400
Doesn't that sound too
manly to be a girl's name?

373
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,160
No. My name is Mahinder.

374
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,800
Her name is Mahi.

375
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,920
Mahi.

376
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,760
Married?

377
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,400
No. Celibate..

378
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,360
A female who is a celibate.

379
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,080
Not the girl, I am a celibate.

380
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,600
She is still in college.

381
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,640
You don't know what's PayTm
but you keep a tab on every women.

382
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,520
That's because she is my granny
and that's my younger sister Mahi.

383
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,440
Mo..Money..

384
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,760
Yes..where did Deepak get stuck?

385
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,440
- Give me a minute, let me check.
- Okay.

386
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,080
This isn't right.

387
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,560
Grandpa has always been with me.

388
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,680
From school to college,
he accompanied me everywhere.

389
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,200
Why can't I accompany
him on his final journey?

390
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,120
This isn't right, dear.

391
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
Women have always followed men.

392
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,760
It's for their own good.

393
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,280
That's absurd, Poonam aunty.

394
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,160
Don't forget this is Gokul.

395
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,120
The place where Radha's
name is taken before Krishna's.

396
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,520
And Sita's before Ram's.

397
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,960
Women have always been ahead of men,
history is a proof.

398
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,000
- Who are you?
- Don't bother about me.

399
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,760
Please continue.
You are speaking really well.

400
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,600
In fact..take grandma with you as well.

401
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,920
Even she is a woman.

402
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,240
God forbid if anything happens to her..

403
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,480
...which will...

404
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,120
Will you bury her in your backyard?

405
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,480
And never take her to the crematorium.

406
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,160
- Right, grandma.
- Who the heck are you?

407
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,120
Wanting me to die so early.

408
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,520
Karamveer,
I live infront of the Gokul Temple.

409
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,360
House no. 865/1

410
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,600
Aunty..you must also
go to the crematorium.

411
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,760
Not every woman looks
good on their deathbed.

412
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,680
Where is my money?

413
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,000
Here you are.
Is it all here?

414
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,280
Radhe-Radhe.

415
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,160
Your mother would
have been so happy today.

416
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,040
That her son is climbing
the ladder of success.

417
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,400
Look.

418
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,680
But this is Hema Malini.

419
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,680
That's my dream girl.
This is your mother.

420
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,120
Take her blessings.

421
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,920
She would have been extremely happy.

422
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,200
You are a wonderful boy.

423
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,000
Because boys these days
claim one thing and do another.

424
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,480
- Rascals.
- Dad..I am getting late.

425
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,000
Listen, I have a question.

426
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,120
Why the night shift?

427
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,760
When we make toothpaste all night..

428
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,400
..then only can people brush
their teeth in the morning.

429
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,080
I never thought of that.

430
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,120
Here is 101 rupees as good luck.

431
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,520
Tonight is your first night,
Pooja baby.

432
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,360
All the best, dear.

433
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,760
She will transfer the calls to you.

434
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,400
Radhe-Radhe.

435
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,240
Hello.

436
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,400
The call's connected.

437
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,760
I am Pooja.

438
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,800
- Who is this?
- Dev speaking.

439
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,240
Pooja baby..come over.
there's three of us.

440
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,600
Do you want the 4th one to accompany
you for your father's final rights?

441
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,960
Hang up!

442
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,080
What are you doing?

443
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,960
Why are you yelling at the customers?

444
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,920
Customers are God.

445
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,680
Which God calls up a girl at 2 am?

446
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,000
We've to raise their bill,
and not our blood pressure.

447
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,160
Understand.

448
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,760
Understood?

449
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,880
Hello.
Is this Pooja?

450
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,960
Yes, this is your Pooja.
Who is this?

451
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,600
Gurbachan Singh speaking.

452
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,640
Gurpu.

453
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,040
Are you fine?

454
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,320
What?

455
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,320
I said are you fine?

456
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,920
Yes, I am fine.

457
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,160
- Is this Pooja?
- You are right.

458
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,240
And you win a dozen smooches
from me for the right guess.

459
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,320
My girlfriend dumped me.

460
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,560
I am with you. Don't worry.

461
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,440
I have enough money.

462
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,000
But I can't find
a bride to marry.

463
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,080
How old are you?

464
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,200
Sweet-70.

465
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,280
Stop looking for a bride..

466
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,200
..and start looking for
a bus for your final destination.

467
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,440
Who is speaking?

468
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,080
This is your Pooja speaking.

469
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,840
Wow..you have a very sweet voice.

470
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,120
Thank you.

471
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,880
You know, whenever I talk to you,
I want to do things to you.

472
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,640
What things?

473
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,680
You know..

474
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,280
What you're mistaking for Taj Mahal
is actually Qutub Minar.

475
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,200
- Now hang up.
- Oh really?

476
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,640
Hi, I am Pooja.

477
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,600
Hello. Pooja speaking.

478
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,680
I am Pooja speaking.

479
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,200
Hi, Pooja speaking.

480
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,640
Hello. I am Pooja.

481
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,680
You are not Pooja.
Give the phone to Pooja.

482
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
Are you drunk?

483
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,600
How do you know?

484
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,080
I can smell it all the way.

485
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,640
I see..you are a smart one.

486
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,520
Anyway..

487
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,160
From today you will be my regular.

488
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,360
Wait..hold on.

489
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,040
Stop calling me over
and over again, mom.

490
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,080
I am busy..

491
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,560
If you call again,
then I'll turn my phone off.

492
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,280
Hello.

493
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,120
Is there someone
more important than me?

494
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,760
No one. It's just my mom.

495
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,520
She keeps disturbing me all the time.

496
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,200
Maybe it's important.

497
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,040
It's nothing important.
All mothers are like this.

498
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,600
I am sure your mother's like this too.

499
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,920
See, I have lost my mother

500
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,160
So talk politely to your
mother just like you talk to me.

501
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,720
But my mother doesn't
sound sweet like you.

502
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,960
What to do?

503
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,120
You are crazy.

504
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,520
That I am.

505
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,560
Can I hang up now?

506
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,720
Okay.

507
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,640
But I will wait for your call.

508
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,600
I see..naughty girl.

509
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,120
You must have enjoyed today, right?

510
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,600
How was your first night?

511
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,240
It wasn't my wedding night.
I was working.

512
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,280
The kind of job you are doing
I don't think there is much difference.

513
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,200
Didn't you get any lewd calls?

514
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,320
A couple of rascals did call.

515
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,600
But the call after
that..really shocked me.

516
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,560
People are very lonely.

517
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,480
They don't have a friend.

518
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,960
And some are so lonely..

519
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,920
..that their loneliness
is all they have to cling on to.

520
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,640
It's quiet true.

521
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,080
These cops just
don't leave anyone alone.

522
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,720
Another Police barricade.
Do you have some money?

523
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,320
Let me check.

524
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,760
Out for a midnight drive?

525
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,400
Where are you coming
from Fred and Barney?

526
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
Office.

527
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,480
Drunk.

528
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,400
No..

529
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,280
We are drunk.

530
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,120
We need a ride.

531
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,680
But three men are
not allowed on a bike.

532
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,920
I see..

533
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,200
Gurpreet..are you comfortable?

534
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,040
Not every Sardar is
a Gurpreet or a Harpreet.

535
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,640
My name's Smiley.

536
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,960
But in case you are not comfortable..

537
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,000
..I'll sit on the handlebar instead.

538
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,880
No..why would you sit on the handlebar?

539
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,720
Just a little longer.

540
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,880
We'll get off at the next block.
Right.

541
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,080
How about a few lines..

542
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,440
Bravo. Bravo.

543
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,760
Death is inevitable.

544
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,360
And love is filled
with suffering and pain.

545
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:36,080
Life is filled with hardships
and this is where we get off.

546
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,680
Stop the bike.

547
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'll get down here.

548
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,680
But your destination
hasn't arrived yet.

549
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,080
I am so high that I just remembered..

550
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,840
..my home's on the route to Noida.

551
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,240
No wonder..
Stop here! Stop!

552
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,160
Shift back.

553
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,480
- Jawahar.
- Yes.

554
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,360
Don't show up on time tomorrow.

555
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
Only if I get home safe and sound.

556
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,240
Stop. Stop.

557
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,400
You're a natural poet.

558
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,520
Your poems are filled with pain.

559
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,640
Once you are married son..

560
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,520
The pain and suffering
come out through your words.

561
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,200
And on that note..here's another.

562
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,960
No, we're in a hurry

563
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,400
Fine Then just say bravo.

564
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,160
Because you know I am good at it.

565
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,400
Bravo. Bravo.

566
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,840
See you then.

567
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,160
'I am searching you everywhere.'

568
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,360
Not at this hour.

569
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,080
Not that. Extra income

570
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,440
Silly girl, I am a poet
and poets only write poems..

571
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,080
..and not take bribe.

572
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,280
- Here's a fresh one.
- Shut up.

573
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,960
Mr. Poet..

574
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,960
Your poetry isn't going
to improve our condition.

575
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,720
The constable next door
just bought a used car.

576
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,000
And look at you who has to take
a lift every day to get home.

577
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,800
And you are drunk again.

578
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,640
Have you ever seen me drinking?

579
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,840
Seriously?

580
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,080
Are the children asleep?

581
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,400
Children? We have only one kid.

582
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,840
Then I must be drunk.

583
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,960
Make it hot.

584
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,080
What?

585
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,040
Dinner, what else.

586
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,800
Why do you get romantic all the time?

587
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,960
Of course, because that's
all I am good for anyway.

588
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,200
You come home drunk,
and I serve you your dinner.

589
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,800
What else do you want?

590
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,360
You want to drink instead.

591
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,600
Shut up.

592
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,240
Marrying you was the
biggest mistake of my life.

593
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,120
Here take it.

594
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,640
Tell him.

595
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,480
White hair in the food.

596
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,880
When the cook's got white hair,
then what else do you expect?

597
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,600
I wonder when we'll find
some black hair in the food.

598
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,560
That reminds me..I
have searched for a bride

599
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,280
Really?

600
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,800
But no..

601
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,000
As I said before,
I don't want to get married.

602
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,880
Uncle, he meant for himself.

603
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,080
I see.

604
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,320
But son. who is she? Where is she from?

605
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,520
What about her family?

606
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,440
There are only 3 members in the family.

607
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,960
The oldest one is the Grandmother, who
is older than the French Revolution.

608
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,120
- Seriously.
- The other one is Mahinder.

609
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,080
A staunch celibate. Bachelor.

610
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,200
And the only females in his
life is Gita, Sunita, Babita, Lalita..

611
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,360
So many.

612
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Cows and Buffaloes.

613
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,760
And the third one is your
daughter-in-law Mahi.

614
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,480
Beautiful, Talented.

615
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,680
5'4 inches.

616
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,280
She is completing her Home
Science from the University.

617
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,920
And she is such a good cook..
She will cook for you.

618
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,000
Finally, we'll get
some good food around here.

619
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,720
Is this bad?
Keep it down.

620
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,720
No, it's nice. I am eating.

621
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,720
Tell me something more.

622
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,880
It's the Thakur family
that live in the manor.

623
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,360
But they are nobles.

624
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,480
We aren't exactly paupers either.

625
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,280
Get me more stuffed bread, uncle.

626
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,440
We're out of flour, son.

627
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,480
Baby..your birthday's
on the 23rd, right.

628
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,760
Yes.

629
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,000
I'll gift you a diamond ring.

630
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,720
- Bye, baby.
- Bye.

631
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,720
- I'll miss you.
- Bye. See you.

632
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,360
Thank you.

633
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,160
Good morning.
- Good morning.

634
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,720
Hello, ma'am.
- What hello?

635
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,720
What is this?

636
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,600
- When will you finish this work?
- That..

637
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,280
Baby.

638
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,560
- You?
- Can I have some cash?

639
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,720
- Yeah, sure.
- Cash.

640
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,360
You were just talking about
gifting her a diamond ring.

641
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,520
Are you going to buy
that ring with her money?

642
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,600
Poor guy.

643
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,960
Why?

644
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,520
You are new around here.

645
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,480
She's had three breakups.

646
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,720
And she doesn't trust men anymore.

647
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,600
Men are just leeches.

648
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,480
- No, ma'am..
- Am I right?

649
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,520
You guys can only break hearts right.

650
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,520
What breaking hearts?

651
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,120
Then why did she hire us?

652
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,120
So she can humiliate us every day.

653
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,120
I don't carry cash, only cards.

654
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,400
I see..

655
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,520
Cards.

656
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,120
Like these four visiting
cards and loose change.

657
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,680
She has reached the
pinnacle of success..

658
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,000
She even learnt English..

659
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,920
But still has no class.

660
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,200
Show me your phone.

661
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,400
I said show me your phone.

662
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,840
Ma'am, it's personal.

663
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,960
What are you doing, sister?

664
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,240
What sister?

665
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,720
Do I look like your sister?

666
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,520
- No, you are not..
- Then?

667
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,920
And who are they?

668
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,680
They must be your sisters as well,
aren't they?

669
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,200
Or were you planning to buy
diamond rings for them as well?

670
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,280
Baby, I can explain.

671
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,280
What..are you going to explain, Jatin.

672
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,520
Who are they?

673
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,680
Baby, I love you.

674
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,080
Just shut up. I don't want
to see your face. Get out from here.

675
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,080
- I love you.
- I said get out.

676
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,120
You heard her. Get out!

677
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,600
Don't try to threaten me.
Get lost.

678
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,480
And what are you all watching?

679
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,960
What is so funny?

680
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,800
Rajpal.

681
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,920
- Rajpal.
- Yes, sir.

682
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,480
Rajpal..what is this?

683
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,040
Register, sir.

684
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,800
I know that, uncle.

685
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,920
But read this out for me.
Please..

686
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:25,000
Sunil Bhardwaj, son of Om Bharadwaj,
Resident of Faridabad's..

687
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,280
..motorcycle went missing from..

688
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,800
..Chetterbata Chowk
on the 25th of the month..

689
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,600
..O my crazy heart, what have you done
I feel like I'm neither alive nor dead.

690
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,160
What is wrong with me?

691
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,840
I think someone wrote
an FIR in the poem.

692
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,400
Not someone.

693
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,520
You again wrote a poem
in the FIR register!

694
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,480
Me?

695
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,760
How many times have I told you..

696
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,600
Keep your poet in your..

697
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,880
Outside this Police Station.

698
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,120
Otherwise,
I'll lock you up without an FIR.

699
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,320
I just thought of two more lines..

700
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,400
Bravo.

701
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,080
Fix this first.

702
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,960
How dare you tease a police officer?

703
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,400
I'll throw you out where
you'll starve to death.

704
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,400
I am not teasing you, uncle.

705
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,720
Since morning I've been observing
that no one's listening to your poems.

706
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,920
Will you?

707
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,480
I won't either. But I can help you.

708
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,640
Give me your phone.

709
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Why do you want my phone?

710
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,640
Give it to me once.

711
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,440
What is this?

712
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,680
This is a special number.

713
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,360
She will listen to everything you say,
and even repond to it.

714
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,880
I see..

715
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,520
- Would you like some tea?
- Liquor would be better.

716
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,360
Don't try to take
advantage of the situation.

717
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,960
No tea for you.

718
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,480
Uncle..listen..

719
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,320
Let's try this number..

720
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,040
Hello.

721
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,400
Hello, who is this?

722
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,640
This is Pooja.

723
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,120
Pooja.

724
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,440
What a sweet name.

725
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,240
And even a sweeter voice.

726
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,160
Enough about me,
tell me something about yourself.

727
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,400
And a Haryanvi too.

728
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,640
- Are you from Rohtak too?
- No, Panipat.

729
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,600
Panipat. Great!

730
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,920
What do you do?

731
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,560
Well..I

732
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,080
I am a poetic.

733
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,400
You mean you're a poet.

734
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,920
- Are they different?
- Yes.

735
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,680
Then whatever you said.

736
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,320
Why don't you recite
a few lines for me.

737
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,840
Will you listen to it?

738
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,920
- Really?
- Of course..

739
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,520
I just came up with
this a few hours ago.

740
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,680
My heart says I should meet her.

741
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,960
My heart says I should meet her.

742
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,480
but my mind says that you are on duty.

743
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,920
Bravo... Bravo...

744
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,760
Really?

745
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,520
Too good.
Superb.

746
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,920
Thank you.

747
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
If you don't mind,
can I say something too?

748
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,600
Are you a poet too?

749
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,000
Occasionally.

750
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,640
Encore. Encore.

751
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,520
You mean go for it.

752
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,280
- Are they different too?
- Obviously.

753
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,000
Then whatever you said.

754
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,200
- Hear this.
- Yes.. yes..

755
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,400
- My heart says I should meet her.
- Yeah...

756
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,840
- My heart says I should meet her.
- Yeah...

757
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,920
My mind says meet
her when the duty's over.

758
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,680
My, my, my..

759
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,480
Stop wailing.
We haven't found your bike yet.

760
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,760
Sir, its the guy who lost his bike.
He's been bothering me.

761
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,280
And my mind says meet
her when the duty's over.

762
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,720
There's no sign of electricity,
but the bill is always on time.

763
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,480
Hurry up.

764
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,600
- Here you go.
- The website is pretty slow.

765
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,200
And the office is close to my college.
I'll pay the bill here.

766
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,760
Yes.
Yes, okay. Bye.

767
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,240
- Pay your bill.
- What are you doing?

768
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,120
Today is the last date?

769
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,760
But I think it's my first date.

770
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,480
I see..

771
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,560
House no. 865/1.

772
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,600
Close to Gokul Temple.

773
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,920
I've been observing for some time now..

774
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,800
..that you and your friend
have been following me everywhere.

775
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,880
Be it my home or restaurant.

776
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,920
Hello.

777
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,000
Don't be under any delusion.

778
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,320
Only I am following you.

779
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,920
When a boy shifts his entire focus
on a girl, do you know what it means?

780
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,160
Yes..

781
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,560
That he is extremely free

782
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,480
Maybe he's a busy guy..

783
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,480
..and freed up his schedule
for someone special.

784
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,840
Cardamom tea, strong coffee..

785
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,760
- One tea for me.
- It's over already.

786
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,640
Strong coffee, cardamom tea..

787
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,960
Would you prefer tea or coffee?

788
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,280
None

789
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,480
Waste of money.

790
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,040
- Uncle, you wanted tea.
- Don't want it now.

791
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,280
- Come on.
- I said I don't want it.

792
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,800
- You can pay me half the price.
- I don't want it.

793
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:19,840
Honestly, first time in my
life I am enjoying a queue this long.

794
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,080
Can I be honest too?

795
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,800
You talk too much.

796
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,400
But you speak well.

797
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,400
Every day's a Rose Day.
Every day's a Rose Day.

798
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,120
- Every day's a Rose Day.
- Give me a Rose.

799
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,480
Come on.

800
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,160
What? Do you want one?

801
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,680
Come, I'll get you one.

802
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,880
Come on.

803
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,160
Give me your..bill.

804
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,160
Bill.

805
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,360
Actually, you got the hint right.

806
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,520
I want our electricity
bill to be on the same address.

807
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,200
865/1

808
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,440
Let's get to know each other first.

809
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,120
""I am here so are you..""

810
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,680
""...gazing in each other's eyes.""

811
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,040
""Love has made my heart go astray.""

812
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,360
""I am here so are you..""

813
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,920
""...gazing in each other's eyes.""

814
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:43,000
""Love has made my heart go astray.""

815
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,840
""Everyone's been
blessed by your grace..""

816
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,560
""..but I am still
waiting for my luck to shine.""

817
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,640
""One meeting..""

818
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,440
""One meeting was all it took..""

819
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:04,320
""..and as she smiled.""

820
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,040
""She always dwelled in my dreams..""

821
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:14,160
""..but it's hard to believe
she has become my reality.""

822
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:23,440
""I wonder when I was
overwhelmed by love.""

823
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,160
""One meeting was all it took..""

824
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:34,360
""..and as she smiled.""

825
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:50,520
""I am unaware of things around me..""

826
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,960
""..my heart is no
longer in my control.""

827
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:00,080
""Why am I losing control
over my desires?""

828
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:04,320
""I wonder why my heart's on fire.""

829
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,960
""My wishes are getting fulfilled.""

830
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:14,200
""And giving rise to more desires.""

831
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,040
""Everyone was blessed by your grace..""

832
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,360
""..but I am still
waiting for luck to shine on me.

833
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,840
""One meeting..""

834
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,640
""One meeting was all it took..""

835
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:35,560
""..and as she smiled.""

836
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,240
""She always dwelled in my dreams..""

837
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:45,360
""..but it's hard to believe

838

""One meeting was all it took..""

840
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,640
""..and as she smiled.""

841
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,960
Hello. Pooja speaking.

842
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,080
Give the phone to Pooja
and tell her its Roma.

843
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,720
I promise you will
like talking to this Pooja better.

844
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,080
Don't play smart with me, okay.

845
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,520
This is not my first call.

846
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,720
What are you looking at? Get lost?

847
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,680
You don't know who I am.

848
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,760
Edgy on the outside,
still on the inside.

849
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,160
- That's who you are.
- Wow.

850
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,280
You nailed that.

851
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,240
Although it was a fluke,
you have hit the right spot.

852
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,640
I guess your heart and trust
have been shattered more than once.

853
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,040
Yeah.

854
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,560
Long story.

855
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,640
Three boys broke my heart.

856
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,200
Why do you do it with
three boys at a time?

857
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,160
Hey..not like that.

858
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,800
At different times.

859
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,440
Trust me,
I am speaking out of experience.

860
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,960
All men are dogs.

861
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,520
In fact..If I could have my wish

862
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,960
..I would strip them naked
and crush them under a bulldozer.

863
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,040
Cool crush them under a bulldozer..

864
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,680
..but what is the
need to strip them naked?

865
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,440
All men are..

866
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,360
Not every guy is same.

867
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,680
Hey, don't address me as sister.

868
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,560
I don't look like a sister.

869
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,400
Trust has no gender.

870
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,080
Women can be just as deceptive.

871
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,240
Not Really.

872
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:25,360
Girls are..sensitive,
sensible, understanding.

873
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,080
Like you and me.

874
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,120
Finally, I feel better
after talking to you.

875
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,280
Me too.

876
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:36,520
In fact, you sound a lot
better than the previous Pooja.

877
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,600
Today onwards you are Pooja for me.

878
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,720
It's ringing. It's ringing.

879
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,160
Hello.
- Hello.

880
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,080
How are you doing, Pooja?

881
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,960
I am doing great.
Did you write anything new?

882
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,560
Of course, I did..just yesterday.

883
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:05,200
My life's trapped in a cage,
waiting to break free.

884
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,280
To destroy itself..in love.

885
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,440
Let me taste your sweet
voice with my ears..

886
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,400
..be the sweet nectar of my love.

887
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,600
Oh, God.

888
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,040
You've fallen too low.

889
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,280
You write so well, why don't
you work on your pronunciation.

890
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,960
There are also other things
in world other than love.

891
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,280
Why don't you try writing about them?

892
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,480
Yes, of course.

893
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,800
How can I say no to my Pooja?

894
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,000
Look..you're my Pooja.

895
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,520
Only my Pooja.

896
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,360
My Pooja. My foot...My Pooja. My Pooja.

897
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,880
Just doesn't leave me alone...

898
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,480
No need to come to the
call centre from tomorrow.

899
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,080
My thoughts exactly, sir.

900
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,680
And anyway,
the loans have been almost repaid.

901
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,400
Here are the car keys.

902
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,880
It's right outside. Park it.

903
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,760
And do it properly.

904
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,000
Pooja Darling,
congratulations on the new office.

905
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,520
What is this, sir?

906
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,600
I was not asking you
to quit the call centre.

907
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,520
Then.

908
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,720
Starting from today
this car is your new office.

909
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,720
Now Pooja is available
24/7 for her fans.

910
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,160
How?

911
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,280
Open that box.

912
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,160
Smartwatch.

913
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,120
And I can keep the car too.

914
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,640
Thank you, sir.

915
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,560
By the way, I didn't deserve this car..

916
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,000
Get going or should I take the keys.

917
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,040
Going.

918
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,160
Who parked this car
in front of my house?

919
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,560
Is this yours?

920
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,040
No, it's not mine.

921
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,440
It cannot be yours.

922
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,200
Whose car is this?

923
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,760
Papa, this is our car.

924
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,040
- Our car?
- Yes.

925
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,200
Did you take a loan as well?

926
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,800
The company gifted me.

927
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,200
Radhe-Radhe.

928
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,240
Radhe-Radhe.

929
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,400
Pooja..

930
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,200
Don't scare me like that.
Why can't you say it directly?

931
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,840
But it's necessary.

932
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,080
Work is worship.

933
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,640
Come here.
Sit.

934
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,200
- Come on.
- I see...

935
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,800
Sideways..

936
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,160
Tuck your shirt in.

937
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,960
My life's trapped in a cage,
waiting to break free.

938
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,240
To destroy itself..in love.

939
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,000
Let me taste your sweet
voice with my ears..

940
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,520
..be the sweet nectar of my love.

941
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,560
Nice. Who wrote it?

942
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,720
I...... did not.

943
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,680
A friend of mine, who is a poet.

944
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,600
- Nice, isn't it?
- It is.

945
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,960
Take it.

946
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,160
leave it.

947
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,720
Enjoying the drive.

948
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,680
Pick it up. It can be important.

949
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,960
Okay..

950
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,760
- Hello Pooja.
- Wrong number.

951
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,240
Hello Pooja, this is Rahul.

952
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,160
There is no Pooja here.
I told you its a wrong number.

953
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,560
But I regularly speak
with Pooja on this number.

954
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,920
I said hang up.

955
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,080
People call all the
time asking for some Pooja.

956
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,800
- Bye.
- Bye.

957
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,040
- Radhe-Radhe.
- Radhe-Radhe.

958
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:53,920
Hello.

959
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,640
- New car?
- Yes...

960
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,560
Hello.

961
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,840
Is this Pooja speaking?

962
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,080
If you called on Pooja's number, then
you can't expect Diana Penty to pick up.

963
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,200
Panty?

964
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,840
You didn't notice I said Diana,
you dog.

965
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,800
Don't call me a dog.

966
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,080
- Hello...
- Deepak, move.

967
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,920
There's enough space.

968
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,400
Your sound like you
are a very handsome guy.

969
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,040
Do you want to meet me?

970
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,960
It's my mother from Benares.

971
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,800
Your mother from Benaras, huh..

972
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,400
Do you have a mother in every city?

973
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,400
Let me hear her voice.

974
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,520
What happened, Kishore?
Who is disturbing us?

975
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,400
Your mother has such a sweet voice.

976
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,200
Whose mother is this?

977
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,160
Mother?

978
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,240
Pooja.

979
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,040
People call me Pooja with love.

980
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,560
What can I call you?

981
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,880
Well, call me anything you like..

982
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,320
Well, call me anything you like..

983
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,520
Don't tell her your real name.

984
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,360
Rafi. His name is Rafi.

985
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,160
Wow..what a match. Kishore and Rafi.

986
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,080
Then sing something for me, Rafi.

987
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,640
Sorry, but I don't sing.

988
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,400
How is it possible? How can
you not sing if your name is Rafi?

989
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,640
Impossible.

990
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,360
Brother has a velvety voice.

991
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,400
Sing..

992
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,440
Sing something for me please.

993
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,800
What should I sing?

994
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,480
""Madhuban Mein Radhika Nache Re..""

995
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,760
What song is that?

996
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,400
You were asking like
you remember all the songs.

997
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,880
Sing anything..

998
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,440
Wow..what a unique voice.

999
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,760
Amazing reverb.

1000
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,360
- No, that wasn't..
- Come on, sing for me sweetheart.

1001
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,520
This is me singing..

1002
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:50,200
""Since I saw...your rosy eyes...""

1003
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:55,160
""...my heart's on a high.""

1004
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,440
""Hold me...guys...""

1005
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,000
Can you sing too?

1006
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,880
""Once I think of you,
I can't get over it.""

1007
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,320
""I can't even sleep, beloved.""

1008
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,760
That touched my heart.

1009
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,560
""Once I think of you,
I can't get over it.""

1010
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,080
""I can't even sleep, beloved.""

1011
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,600
""My Romeo boy..""

1012
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,280
""..your Juliet's ready.""

1013
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,920
""Bring me a diamond ring.""

1014
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,480
""For you,
my heart rings like a telephone.""

1015
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:52,160
""For you,
my heart rings like a telephone.""

1016
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:56,720
""For you,
my heart rings like a telephone.""

1017
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,200
""For you,
my heart rings like a telephone.""

1018
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,840
Where do you sing from?

1019
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,440
""Be my dream girl..""

1020
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,640
""..I am searching for your love.""

1021
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,080
""I might just die..""

1022
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,920
""..I am searching for your love.""

1023
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,520
""Be my dream girl..""

1024
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,520
""..I am searching for your love.""

1025
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,040
""I might just die..""

1026
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,600
""..I am searching for your love.""

1027
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,120
""It feels so good when I talk to you.""

1028
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:44,080
""Everyone is a liar,
and I am your true love.""

1029
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,680
""It feels so good when I talk to you.""

1030
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,200
""Everyone is a liar,
and I am your true love.""

1031
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,160
Pooja, next month is my birthday.

1032
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,400
So happy birthday in advance.

1033
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,560
You are coming over this time.

1034
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,440
I can't come this time.
But next time promise.

1035
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,760
""I want you to hear
my poems in person.""

1036
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:15,160
""I am no amateur,
but the son of Ghalib.""

1037
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,520
Gha-lib.

1038
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,600
- Are they different?
- Yes.

1039
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,760
I see..

1040
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,120
Who left the door open?
Catch them..

1041
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,320
""Once I hold your hand..""

1042
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,600
""..fortune will smile over me.""

1043
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,600
""Even my dreams convey..""

1044
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,800
""..that we must meet.""

1045
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,080
Wow! Superb!

1046
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,640
""I want your love.""

1047
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,600
""You're the one I want to be with.""

1048
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,640
""I am your queen and you're my king.""

1049
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,000
Son. I can hear a girl talking.

1050
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,360
Papa, have told you
ample number of times..

1051
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,960
..to find a living
girl and get married.

1052
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,760
You're too much.

1053
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,600
""For you,
my heart rings like a telephone.""

1054
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:09,000
""For you,
my heart rings like a telephone.""

1055
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:13,680
""For you,
my heart rings like a telephone.""

1056
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,200
""Be my dream girl..""

1057
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,280
""..I am searching for your love.""

1058
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,720
""I might just die..""

1059
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,800
""..I am searching for your love.""

1060
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,200
""Be my dream girl..""

1061
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,280
""..I am searching for your love.""

1062
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,760
""I might just die..""

1063
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,160
""..I am searching for your love.""

1064
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,240
Happy birthday Toto, how are you?

1065
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,320
Not good.

1066
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,600
I haven't cut the cake yet.

1067
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,920
I kept insisting.. let's meet,
let's met.

1068
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,680
Fine, don't come.

1069
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,360
Are you taking me for a ride?

1070
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,440
Don't be stubborn, Toto.

1071
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,000
I've told you before.
we can't meet.

1072
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,120
Will you like it if
I get fired from the job.

1073
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,440
Yes, I will.
Then you can stay with me.

1074
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,000
I will marry you.

1075
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,400
You are too young.

1076
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,560
Marry me and I will grow up.

1077
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,640
So..when are we meeting?

1078
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,960
Like I said we can't meet.

1079
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,280
You will have to meet me, Pooja.

1080
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,640
Or else you will regret it.

1081
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,480
You can do whatever you want.

1082
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,040
Hello..

1083
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,840
Hung up on me.

1084
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,760
Now watch what I do.

1085
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,240
Jawahar..are you there yet?

1086
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,200
Long time ago

1087
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:28,080
I will be leaving soon.
Just waiting for a ride.

1088
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,600
Wait for me.

1089
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,200
Coming.

1090
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,920
It's you.

1091
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,040
He is our guy.

1092
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,000
You got so tired
of giving us a lift..

1093
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,080
..that you bought a car instead.

1094
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,040
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1095
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,320
Let's go.

1096
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,560
Feels nice whenever I see you.

1097
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,040
You remind me of someone.

1098
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,400
Are you married?

1099
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,000
No, sir. Just got engaged.

1100
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,760
What about you?

1101
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,880
Look at the forehead.

1102
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:10,960
Married women have a tint of
vermillion and men have lines of worry.

1103
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,640
That's frown.

1104
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,800
Are they different?

1105
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,040
Yes.

1106
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,120
So..whatever you say.

1107
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,880
Sir, you should only
marry the one you love.

1108
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,360
That's so true.

1109
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,360
On that note,
you must hear this poem.

1110
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,440
My heart says I should meet her.

1111
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,640
What does it say?

1112
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,800
My heart says I should meet her.

1113
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,520
And my mind says meet
her when the duty's over.

1114
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:44,880
How was it?

1115
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,360
Look..trouble calling.

1116
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,680
Where are you?

1117
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,200
I'll be late.
Stop calling me repetitively.

1118
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,080
If you can't stand me,
then why don't you divorce me.

1119
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,240
Fine, I will divorce you soon.

1120
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,600
I have also found someone else.

1121
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,760
The one who has improved my
poetry will reform my life as well.

1122
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,840
I know one thing..

1123
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,120
One should marry the one you love.
Right?

1124
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,160
Even I will marry my Pooja.

1125
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,920
Will you hang up or should I?

1126
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,440
Go to hell!

1127
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,080
See..

1128
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,680
Turn here.

1129
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,760
I am heading to the hospital.

1130
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,040
Hospital?

1131
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,440
Boys these days don't
know anything about love.

1132
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,320
The girl refused to meet
and the guy slit his wrist.

1133
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,560
Imagine..

1134
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,680
So..here we are.

1135
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,640
Bravo. Bravo. Bravo.

1136
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,240
What did you
say the guy's name was?

1137
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,960
- Toto.
- Toto..

1138
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,040
Yes.

1139
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,360
Toto!

1140
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,680
Wedding's around the corner..

1141
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,080
And one guy slit his wrist.

1142
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,880
another one is dumping his wife..

1143
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,920
..and the other one
is a female herself.

1144
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,080
Everyone's after me.

1145
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,000
I don't know whether I should
dress like a groom or a bride.

1146
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,880
You know what..you'll
look amazing in a wedding gown too.

1147
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,800
Rascal..I am in no mood for jokes.

1148
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,840
I am quitting my job.

1149
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,040
So who is stopping you?

1150
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,440
But why tell Mahi about it?

1151
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,680
Mahi is a nice girl.

1152
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,880
The foundation of any
relationship is trust.

1153
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,360
I can break her heart
but not her trust.

1154
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,400
Great!

1155
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,440
Great.

1156
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:50,840
Till date,
my hero was Kookie Dhillon.

1157
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,520
Who is that idiot?

1158
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,880
My father.

1159
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,320
And now you are too..

1160
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,560
What? Your father?

1161
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,880
My hero bro.

1162
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,960
Go and tell whomever you like.
Smiley is with you always.

1163
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,040
Quit your job.

1164
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,960
And inform your boss.

1165
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,040
Hello, W sir.

1166
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:22,080
""..my heart's on a high.""

1167
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,080
""Hold me..guys..""

1168
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,720
Mahinder..

1169
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,200
- Mahinder!
- Yes.

1170
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,920
""The weather's
very untrusting, today.""

1171
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,040
Forget it. Where is Mahi?

1172
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,200
Maybe upstairs.

1173
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,400
Brother-in-law. I have a question.

1174
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,320
Go on.

1175
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:43,320
You know that Mahi and Granny
are the only females in my life.

1176
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,000
I already know that.

1177
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,800
Fine, I am going to ask.

1178
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:52,640
If I want to tell a female
friend..about my feelings.

1179
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,880
Then how do I do it?

1180
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,560
Which buffalo are you in love with now?

1181
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,080
Don't get me wrong.

1182
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,760
Tell me.

1183
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,000
Ask her..

1184
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,920
..can I get rid of my single
bed and get a double bed instead?

1185
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,800
And if she says yes, then it's a yes.

1186
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:06,800
What if she says no.

1187
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,320
Then pull her on the single bed.

1188
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,720
Then pull her on the single bed.

1189
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,240
These customers
don't stop calling..

1190
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,880
Hello. Who is this?

1191
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,080
It's me.

1192
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:20,760
Rafi.

1193
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,120
I don't want to hear
any song at this time.

1194
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,280
I don't want to sing,
I want to tell you my feelings.

1195
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,760
Feelings? Go ahead.

1196
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,720
We've been talking for so long.

1197
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,680
I am in love with me.

1198
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,480
I was wondering..

1199
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,840
..can I get rid of my single
bed and buy a double bed instead?

1200
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,600
- Huh?
- Yes?

1201
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,040
Karam.

1202
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,760
What's wrong with him?

1203
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,040
Why is he dancing?
Did he win a lottery?

1204
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,440
He did..

1205
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,600
He really did.

1206
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,760
Brother, what's wrong?

1207
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,240
You have a very talented son.

1208
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,200
He can mimic so many voices.

1209
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,720
And especially he is very
convincing as a female.

1210
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,720
Are females not
convincing enough as themselves?

1211
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,920
A guy mimicking a female's
voice is not a good thing.

1212
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,680
But..I am really
happy that he joined your company.

1213
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,520
Greetings, Sita Maiya.

1214
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,240
Come. Come.

1215
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,240
Karam.

1216
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,000
When you didn't answer my calls..

1217
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:48,640
..I thought I'll personally
pay my respects to Sita Maiya.

1218
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,720
Mr. Jagjit, your son is
a very dedicated worker.

1219
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,200
Your program is telecasted
live all over Gokul.

1220
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,400
I saw it too.

1221
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,000
But I didn't know.

1222
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:05,160
Mr. Jagjeet..I was thinking why don't
I show his work live as well.

1223
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,000
He will become very popular.

1224
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:10,560
That's a great idea.
Let's not delay.

1225
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:11,840
Right, son.

1226
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,720
Shall we?

1227
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,840
- Goodbye.
- Radhe Radhe.

1228
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,680
O Hello. Please stop it for a minute.

1229
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,200
Can we discuss business?

1230
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,480
Hey Karam, Radhe-Radhe.

1231
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:27,200
Wow..people respect you a lot.

1232
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,600
If you don't show up for work..

1233
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:38,640
..then I'll put up big posters
of you all over the city.

1234
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,200
When I am good, I am good.

1235
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,880
But when I am bad..

1236
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,320
..I am even better.

1237
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,040
Radhe-Shyam.

1238
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,520
Come on, guys.
You guys play really well.

1239
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,440
He's already played me.
So stop playing.

1240
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,600
What did he say?

1241
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,320
You told me to quit my job.

1242
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:13,440
Pass me the tea..

1243
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,560
Take it.

1244
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,400
Its' a bad day.

1245
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,080
It's an auspicious day.
Come on, guys.

1246
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,520
Start playing.

1247
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,840
Take it.

1248
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:31,920
Eat.

1249
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:33,560
Look..

1250
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,560
Forget it. It's your wedding bro..

1251
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,040
And look how happy your father is

1252
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,560
Forget it and enjoy your life.

1253
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,400
Uncle, come here.

1254
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,040
- Radhe-Radhe.
- Radhe-Radhe.

1255
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:51,280
Son, I got two wedding
dresses stitched.

1256
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,480
Now you choose which one should I wear?

1257
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,720
- Why don't you wear both of them.
- Great.

1258
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,040
One for your wedding,
and the other..

1259
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,040
Uncle,
I am in no mood to get married.

1260
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,640
I am not talking about you..

1261
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:04,600
I was talking about my wedding.

1262
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,640
- Your wedding?
- Yes, son.

1263
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,640
I haven't told you yet..

1264
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,240
I've..

1265
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,880
.. heard a mother for you.

1266
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:17,960
Heard?

1267
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,600
The term is ""to see"" uncle.

1268
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,240
But I have only heard her.

1269
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:29,240
And you must have heard the
name she addresses your father with.

1270
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,640
Rahul.

1271
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,800
Hello Pooja. It's me Rahul speaking.

1272
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:46,720
Wow..your voice is unique.

1273
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,640
Come here.

1274
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:11,080
Guys, come here.
Start playing.

1275
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,920
'Baby will take you
to Goa for our honeymoon.'

1276
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,840
'Tonight is your first night,
Pooja baby.'

1277
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,320
'From how long we are talking.'

1278
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,200
'Till I only hear your voice.'

1279
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,800
'I just want to meet you.'

1280
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,080
Pooja.

1281
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,960
I love you Pooja.

1282
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,120
I can't live without you.

1283
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,360
Will you..

1284
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,400
..marry me?

1285
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,560
What..

1286
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,120
What?

1287
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,480
This is how I will
propose your future mother, Pooja.

1288
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:09,920
And I'll adorn this
ring on her finger.

1289
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,080
Don't you dare adorn
or take anything off her.

1290
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:13,920
What's wrong now?

1291
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,400
Because you don't have my approval.

1292
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,400
But son, you always insisted
that I should get married.

1293
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,720
And now I am saying
that you cannot marry her.

1294
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,000
I don't approve of this relationship.

1295
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,920
But son, Pooja is a very nice girl.

1296
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,720
You make it sound like you raised her.

1297
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,120
Maybe she looks at you
like a father figure.

1298
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,040
This is unfair..completely..

1299
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,040
I don't care if you treat
me as your father or not..

1300
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,960
..but don't call me her father.

1301
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,800
And you always said that
I don't look a day older than 26.

1302
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,000
Let jokes be jokes.

1303
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,200
She spoke to you nicely on the phone..

1304
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:41,840
..and you think she is your property.

1305
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,960
No means No!

1306
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,160
My jacket.

1307
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,560
That's my jacket you're wearing.
Take it off!

1308
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,480
Enter.

1309
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:02,400
Mother. Mother.

1310
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,000
Son, where had you been all day?

1311
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:09,320
Mother. Look what I won.

1312
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,600
Whatever it is son,
share it equally with your brothers.

1313
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:12,720
- What the..
- Brother.

1314
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,520
Has mother lost her eyesight?

1315
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,800
Mother, you are not blind.

1316
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,880
How can you give
instructions without looking?

1317
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,160
You are absolutely right.

1318
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,920
Forget him.
You belong to us now.

1319
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,240
Mother's order is inevitable.
Right?

1320
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:30,080
From today Draupadi is our wife.

1321
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,320
Absolutely right.

1322
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,640
Mother's order must be carried out.

1323
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:34,640
Carried out.

1324
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,440
- Mother's order must be carried out.
- No..

1325
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,520
Don't you dare lay a finger on me?

1326
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,880
We don't wish to lay our
hands but set our hearts on you

1327
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,400
- Draupadi shall be mine.
- Get lost.

1328
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,480
She will be mine.

1329
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:44,840
She will be mine.

1330
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:45,840
She will be mine.

1331
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,640
I wish you heard what
Draupadi had to say about it.

1332
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,400
Mother warned you against gambling too.

1333
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,960
- Then why the hell..
- What?

1334
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:54,240
.. Why didn't you
listen to your mother then?

1335
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,000
Why did you put Draupadi at
stake after losing everything?

1336
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:58,920
- Draupadi, please.
- Take your hands off.

1337
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,240
Karam, what are you doing?

1338
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,320
I don't have a single
dialogue and he's hitting me.

1339
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,520
You're confusing the scenes.

1340
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:06,880
This scene comes much later.

1341
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:07,960
But it's on the list, isn't it?

1342
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,000
How long will this unfair
treatment of women continue?

1343
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,640
We are not some object.

1344
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,040
If there was MeeToo during Mahabharat..

1345
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,320
..you guys would
be sitting behind the bars.

1346
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,840
- Dear Draupadi..
- Get lost.

1347
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:16,640
Hey Karam, wait.

1348
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:17,600
Count me out.

1349
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,600
- Karam.. Wait..
- I am fed up.

1350
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,280
Karam..listen..

1351
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,840
This is my first
time with you on stage..

1352
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:24,840
..and you are leaving
the rehearsals midway.

1353
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,320
I am not going to
be a part of this show.

1354
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,520
That's it. Stop here.

1355
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,080
What are you guys doing out here?

1356
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,600
Are rehearsals over?

1357
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,240
What on earth are you doing here?

1358
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,080
I made a new soup and
thought you should taste it.

1359
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,480
I am in no mood to eat.

1360
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,160
It's not all that bad.

1361
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,000
And what's wrong with your mood?

1362
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,920
It's Smiley's fault.

1363
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,280
My fault?

1364
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,920
Yes..how can you forget?

1365
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,720
Please remind me.

1366
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,920
There are a couple
of girls chasing him.

1367
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,160
After him?

1368
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,760
Yes..

1369
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,520
Right?

1370
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,600
Yes, sister-in-law.

1371
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,040
Being handsome is a crime these days.

1372
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,240
And if I say a few polite words,
they think I am available.

1373
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,840
- Where do I take my handsomeness..
- Enough.

1374
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,840
There is a girl who he truly loves.

1375
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:13,280
But doesn't know how to
get rid of these inbetweeners.

1376
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:15,680
That's pretty simple.
Stop talking to them.

1377
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,200
You don't think I tried..
I mean don't you think he tried that.

1378
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,400
But now they are
insisting on a meeting.

1379
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:22,760
Yes, sister-in-law. They are threatening
me to slit their wrist or whatever.

1380
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,200
- Where do I take my..
- Enough!

1381
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,560
What will the poor guy do?

1382
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,440
I don't know.

1383
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,640
Sorry.

1384
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,520
Taste this for me.

1385
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,440
I am having tea.
I don't want any damn soup!

1386
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,360
I put in so much effort
to make this soup for you.

1387
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,720
Don't drink it if you don't want to.
At least talk politely.

1388
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:43,840
Mahi!

1389
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,800
If you don't talk politely
to the one you love..

1390
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,480
..they tend to get angry like this.

1391
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:51,840
Understood?

1392
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,560
You must talk to them rudely.

1393
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:01,320
So that the only one left in
your life is the one you love.

1394
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:10,640
All hail mother Sita.

1395
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:14,160
I knew you will come back.

1396
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,880
Now go and work properly.

1397
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,000
Go on.

1398
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,120
How are you, Pooja?

1399
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,160
I am young.

1400
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,760
You think about yourself, old freak.

1401
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,000
I am of your daughter's age.

1402
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,320
You need to catch a breath
between two sentences.

1403
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:44,960
But you dwell in every breath I take.

1404
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:48,160
As for my age.

1405
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:53,560
A man can grow old, but not his heart.

1406
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:58,040
Your heart and mind
is filled with crap.

1407
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,840
When God was gifting brains,
were you cleaning the buffaloes?

1408
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,040
I am done singing for buffaloes.

1409
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,760
Now I want to sing
for my female friend.

1410
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:09,040
""Since I saw...your rosy eyes...""

1411
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,480
Stop liking me.

1412
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,560
Men and women have the same heart.

1413
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:15,720
And sometimes even men
have a heart like women.

1414
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:19,800
That heart is what this Roma has.

1415
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:23,840
You know, when I was in
trouble you took care of me.

1416
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:26,520
But seems like you're
in some kind of trouble.

1417
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:27,800
Now it's my turn to take care of you.

1418
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,160
Even your mother couldn't
take care of you, bloody..

1419
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,880
She's been wandering
from pillar to post.

1420
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,800
I know lovers like you too well.

1421
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,160
Stop this fake pretence.

1422
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,560
Forget about marrying you, I wouldn't
even invite you to my birthday.

1423
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,920
You sound so sweet
even when you're angry.

1424
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,680
What are you worried about?

1425
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,960
I am the one who is
sick and you sound tensed.

1426
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,160
What do you want, just tell me?

1427
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,440
You stop talking.

1428
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:48,680
Your pathetic poetry..

1429
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:52,000
A cheap poet who can't
even get his nuances right.

1430
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:55,560
Utter another word
and I'll sic my dog on you.

1431
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:58,640
Your love has turned me into a dog.

1432
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,720
And if you don't believe me,
then listen to this..

1433
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,360
Stop barking over the phone.
We couldn't find your motorcycle.

1434
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:08,920
The guy's been bugging me.
Keeps calling me every day.

1435
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:15,360
You mean..they loved the
way you were rude with them.

1436
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,280
Yes.

1437
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,040
This was inevitable.

1438
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,080
After all Pooja is the best.

1439
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,400
Honestly, sometimes I think
of drunk dialling you myself.

1440
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:25,800
Get lost.

1441
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,600
I don't know what to do.

1442
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,080
Who is it now..

1443
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,680
Who is it now..

1444
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:35,880
Hello, uncle.

1445
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:37,280
What's wrong?

1446
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:40,640
Well..is your girlfriend
in there with you again?

1447
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:43,480
Yes. I haven't bought a mattress yet.

1448
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,520
You don't say.
Open up.

1449
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,600
They are coming in.

1450
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,720
Listen to me once..

1451
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,400
Where do you think you are going?
Listen to me.

1452
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:54,440
How dare you lie?
Where is your girlfriend?

1453
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,720
Sir, these days boys also..

1454
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,160
Hey, constable..what..

1455
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,120
Get out. How dare you come in?

1456
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:05,080
When we want to shut
down something permanently..

1457
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,240
..we get to the root of it.

1458
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,280
Understand.

1459
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,160
Surgical strike!

1460
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,560
Love you sir.

1461
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,880
- What's wrong?
- I want to kiss you.

1462
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,400
As I said, these days even boys..

1463
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,960
It is true, bro..

1464
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:24,080
Shut it down! Let's go.

1465
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,920
This guy has given me a great idea?

1466
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,760
When you want to shut
down something permanently..

1467
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,520
..get to the root of it.

1468
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,320
Get wherever you want.

1469
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,520
I am sober again.

1470
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,760
Hang up now.
I don't want any credit card.

1471
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,200
Who are you? What do you want?

1472
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,360
Are you Chandrakanta Chaudhary Kirar?

1473
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:57,280
Yes. Why?

1474
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,360
All yours?

1475
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:01,080
No. Chaudhary Kirar's
your mom and I am Chandrakanta.

1476
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,400
How dare you come in without asking?
Who are you?

1477
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,160
- Now, I get it..
- What?

1478
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:11,440
Who is the inspiration
for Rajpal sir's poetry?

1479
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,160
Who?

1480
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,680
You are.

1481
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,080
Me..

1482
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,560
You two just got married, didn't you?

1483
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,560
It's been 10 years.

1484
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:20,880
10 Years!

1485
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,600
And yet you have
that glow on your face.

1486
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:26,880
But after she has kids, there
will be no glow left.

1487
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:31,240
- We have a 9-year-old kid!
- Seriously!

1488
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,040
Yes.

1489
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,000
You look like one of those
moms from the TV commercial.

1490
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,440
- Soap Commercial?
- Yes.

1491
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:43,840
Pray that this glow stays intact.

1492
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,600
We almost forgot..

1493
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,440
Rajpal sir has sent these for you.

1494
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:50,400
Deodorant. Bouquet.

1495
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,640
Heart-shaped cake.
All these gifts are for you.

1496
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,440
It's an apology.

1497
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,000
Well...

1498
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,600
All this is for me.

1499
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,120
Why would he give these to us?

1500
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,240
He never gave me anything
in all these years.

1501
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,080
He's a cop,
after all, they are never on time.

1502
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,200
He's got an entire city to look after.
Keeps him busy.

1503
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:12,760
He loves you alot, just doesn't show.

1504
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,600
Whenever he comes home..

1505
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,680
..give him a tight hug.
And talk to him with a smile.

1506
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,960
See you.

1507
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,680
Do what it takes..

1508
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,520
..but you must take
the law in your hands.

1509
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:27,600
Okay.

1510
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,240
You're out of your mind.
Pooja. Pooja. Pooja.

1511
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,440
Look at you now.

1512
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,880
Stop being so crazy after her.

1513
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,480
Papa, I am in no mood
for a lecture right now.

1514
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,080
Please talk softly.
- Okay.

1515
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,120
- Son..
- Leave. I need to rest.

1516
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:52,160
I'll find out who this Pooja is.

1517
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,280
Once I get my hands on that Pooja..

1518
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,720
Where are you? Walk quickly.

1519
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:03,080
Wake up..you poor Justin Beiber.

1520
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,160
Talk softly..he's just
got out of an ear surgery.

1521
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,360
Does Uncle have piles?

1522
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,040
She said ears.

1523
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,720
Who are you two?

1524
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,440
How dare you talk
back to Pooja's brother?

1525
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,640
So you're that spoilt brat Toto!

1526
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:17,480
Bro, Silence.

1527
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,440
- So you're that spoilt brat Toto.
- Yes..

1528
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,640
Slit your wrist for nothing.
Let me show you then..

1529
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:23,800
No, no, no, no, don't kill him.

1530
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:25,720
- Silence.
- Don't hit him

1531
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,160
We'll hack you to pieces.

1532
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,560
What the hell is this?

1533
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,640
- Trying to be Pooja's die-hard fan.
- He is just a kid.

1534
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:33,080
What kid? He's got more
hairs on his chest than you do.

1535
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:34,040
Oh that is alot of hairs.

1536
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:36,040
Where we come from, Even the
husbands don't tease their wife.

1537
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,040
And you think you can tease her.

1538
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,920
This is not teasing, I love her.

1539
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,200
The entire neighbourhood loves her.
Should I let her marry everyone?

1540
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,920
I know she is shameless, she
talks dirty on the phone.

1541
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,640
- But she is my sister!
- Silence.

1542
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,320
But she is my sister!

1543
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,760
Swear on Sita Maiya..

1544
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,480
..I'll first hack my sister,
and then her lover boy.

1545
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,080
- What is this?
- Silence.

1546
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,320
Oh, God.

1547
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,960
Wait, little Singham.

1548
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,040
Where are you going?

1549
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,400
To get chocolates, papa.

1550
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,240
You always want Chocolate.

1551
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,200
- Here you go.
- But I already have one.

1552
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,440
What the..

1553
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,480
Who gave you this much money?

1554
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:20,640
Mom.

1555
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:23,720
Two strangers came over and
mom seems very happy since.

1556
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:24,640
Go..

1557
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,840
Two strangers.

1558
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:53,920
How am I looking?

1559
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,800
Like a broken beer bottle.

1560
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:57,800
Really?

1561
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,400
Who brought these gifts?

1562
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,880
Don't try to pretend
like you don't know.

1563
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,440
Someone sent these..

1564
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,040
Who?

1565
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,120
My lover..

1566
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,200
What?

1567
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,960
So this has been
going on behind my back.

1568
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,480
And for how long?

1569
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:23,560
Gifts and cash.

1570
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,760
- What are you saying?
- Don't try to change the subject.

1571
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,400
What?
You sent these for me.

1572
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:30,760
Cops don't bribe others,
its what makes them cops.

1573
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:33,520
Wait a minute.
There must be sweets in this.

1574
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,560
- It's a cake..
- Point proved.

1575
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:36,960
I didn't send these.

1576
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:41,520
Policeman are getting
robbed in broad daylight.

1577
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,080
Mind your tongue..
Don't make me angry.

1578
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:46,240
How angry can you get 3-4 feet?

1579
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,400
- And what can you do?
- What can I do?

1580
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:52,320
- First, you send these gifts, and now..
- What can I do?

1581
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,560
You have lost your mind.
I don't want to stay with you.

1582
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,720
- You can keep these. Get lost.
- Go.

1583
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:01,000
I am going to marry my Pooja.

1584
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:04,280
Pooja darling, pick up the phone.

1585
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,120
Hello.

1586
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:22,840
Hello, Pooja.

1587
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:24,720
Pooja.

1588
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,200
Hello..

1589
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,320
Hello.. Hello, Pooja.

1590
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,800
No one's speaking here or here.

1591
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,400
None of them are speaking.

1592
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,720
What are you doing here?

1593
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,920
Your new mom isn't answering her phone.

1594
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
And someone's been calling
on your number constantly.

1595
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,080
Fine. Now go.

1596
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,560
Pooja. Pooja. Pooja. This is Rahul.

1597
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,280
Why weren't you answering the phone?

1598
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,720
I was bathing.

1599
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:56,840
Alone?

1600
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:59,440
No. I bathe with the
entire neighbourhood.

1601
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,680
I wish I lived in your
neighbourhood as well.

1602
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,280
You will, soon.

1603
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:04,480
You wanted to meet, didn't you?

1604
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,800
Yes. When?

1605
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,200
Today evening at 7.

1606
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,360
6:30..I'll be there at 6:30.

1607
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:12,080
Trust me. I'll be there at 6:30.

1608
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,080
Love you!

1609
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:18,440
Love you.

1610
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:19,520
Love you.

1611
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,800
If you say that,
I'll be there by 5:45..

1612
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,240
Karam..
- Yes.

1613
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:32,280
Son, Pooja your future mother..
she called me for a meeting.

1614
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,160
Please come with me.

1615
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:35,680
I am not going anywhere.

1616
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,600
You are still angry with me.

1617
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,160
Wait.

1618
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,040
I gave it a lot of thought.

1619
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,680
I approve of your marriage.

1620
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,680
Son, will you come with me.

1621
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,720
I would, papa.

1622
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:55,640
But since it's your first meeting..

1623
01:17:56,200 --> 01:18:01,000
..she might change her mind looking at
an old husband and a contemprary son.

1624
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,680
Go alone.

1625
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:08,360
Son..you take such good care of me.

1626
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:10,960
I wish..

1627
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:13,880
Enough.

1628
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:17,400
Don't let love drive you crazy,
Jagjeet.

1629
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,880
Congratulations, grandma.

1630
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,600
Congratulations, grandma.

1631
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:25,000
- Congratulations.
- Bless me grandma.

1632
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,680
Congratulations, son.
Congratulations.

1633
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:28,760
Congratulations for what, son.

1634
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,000
Smoking is injurious to health.
Leave it.

1635
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,120
Try this.

1636
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:37,400
I'll make a drink for you, grandma.

1637
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:41,200
Son, this brings back old memories.

1638
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:45,520
I used to sneak a few drinks
when Babu was still alive.

1639
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,080
Babu, Shona, huh!

1640
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,200
Still young at heart, huh!

1641
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,760
Your grandpa's name was Babu Lal.

1642
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,440
Oh..that way.

1643
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,400
Congratulations for what?
You were congratulating for something.

1644
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,240
Mahinder's marriage has been fixed.

1645
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,960
Mahinder's getting married?

1646
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,400
Without telling me?

1647
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:08,920
You don't know?

1648
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,920
You're the oldest living
being in this city..

1649
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,520
.. you deserve to know.

1650
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,600
But why should he?
The wedding date isn't fixed.

1651
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,560
And who knows if grandma
will still be around.

1652
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,640
Not to mention one
less plate at the banquet.

1653
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:23,040
How much do you think grandma would eat
with no teeth.

1654
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,280
Correct.

1655
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,840
It's rude to say such
things about any girl..

1656
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,120
..but its someone called
Pooja who talks dirty on the phone..

1657
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:30,760
..with every Tom-Dick-and-Harry.

1658
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,320
Name is Pooja..and Dirty Talks..

1659
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:37,680
Grandma..talking dirty..phone-a-friend!

1660
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,520
Dirty talking.

1661
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:41,760
Come here, grandma.

1662
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,640
Swear on you..at least
a dozen guys are after her.

1663
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:47,480
If she comes here, then Mahinder
as well as Deepak will be happy.

1664
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:50,080
Why Deepak?

1665
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:52,160
Out of the dozen
guys chasing her..

1666
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:54,120
..Deepak is in the first one.

1667
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,480
He is a total rascal.

1668
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,840
Imagine the type of girl
she is and what her character is.

1669
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:58,840
Grandma..

1670
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:01,200
Mahi will settle down with me.

1671
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,760
But when that girl
comes to this house..

1672
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,440
- ..will she really look after you?
- No, she won't.

1673
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,760
- Will she respect you?
- Never.

1674
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,360
Not even a minute.

1675
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,200
I am sure you've
read the news recently.

1676
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:14,560
""Daughter-in-law suffocates
her grandma-in-law.""

1677
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:16,560
What do you think will happen?

1678
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,760
Grandma's final..

1679
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,480
- What nonsense.
- I meant your final peg..

1680
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,080
At least add some water.

1681
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,760
I won't die so soon.

1682
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:27,720
She is right.

1683
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,360
I'll see how he marries that girl.

1684
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,640
That's it, grandma, keep that attitude.

1685
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:34,560
- See you.
- Our work is done.

1686
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:36,480
Hey, ..put that back.

1687
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:46,480
""And old beeeze that
has brought memories.""

1688
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:52,560
""And old beeeze that
has brought memories.""

1689
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:58,800
""It's not often when he is alone.""

1690
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:00,680
Good evening, sir.

1691
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:02,360
Please, sir. Have a seat.

1692
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:03,560
Please, sit.

1693
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:12,520
Are they.. accepting requests as well.

1694
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,040
Of course, sir.
100 rupees per song, sir.

1695
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:16,880
And what if I request three songs?

1696
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,200
Sorry sir, no discounts.

1697
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,960
Fine..

1698
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:24,280
My name's Jagjeet.

1699
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:27,360
- Jagjeet sir.
- Play these when I signal to you.

1700
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,840
And don't forget to bring the change.

1701
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:36,120
Sir..table no. 10.

1702
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,640
Rahul.

1703
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:44,680
""Fill my life with
the colours of your lips.""

1704
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,240
Who are you, madam?

1705
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,560
Didn't you recognise me, cutu?
Pooja.  - No.

1706
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,680
Pooja?

1707
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,000
And that's my sister Afreen.

1708
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:57,800
Hello.

1709
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:59,200
Hello.

1710
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:02,560
We believe in every religion.
We are coming from the church.

1711
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:06,960
You are Pooja and she is Afreen.

1712
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:12,200
Unfortunately, the profession we are
in, we cannot disclose our real names.

1713
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:19,440
My real name is Zubeida Misba Shoaib
Aktaram Moin Khanum Inzamam Ul-Haqan.

1714
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:23,520
You never told me this before.

1715
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,960
How could I?
Does it make sense?

1716
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:29,240
Don't you look too aged for your name?

1717
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:36,920
""Love cannot be bounded by age.""

1718
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,800
By the way, who else is in your family?

1719
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:42,240
Not much, we are a dozen siblings.

1720
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:46,240
My sisters Razia,
Sultana, and my brother Akbar, Babur..

1721
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:49,360
..Dilawar, Zorawar, Peshawar and Qutub.

1722
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,920
I think you missed Shahjahan.

1723
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,760
Ohh come one, Father had
other stuff to take care of as well.

1724
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,120
This is the main stuff
that he looks concerned about.

1725
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,800
What does your father do?

1726
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:00,280
He works at a medical
store near our place.

1727
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:01,920
Looking at the number of siblings..

1728
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,160
..I don't think there are any
medical stores around your place.

1729
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:06,400
Anyway, I accept..

1730
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:07,280
Accept what?

1731
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,800
Our marriage

1732
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:10,440
Father's on a Hajj trip.

1733
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,280
He'll meet you as
soon as he comes back.

1734
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:14,480
But don't mind if he touches
your feet out of respect

1735
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,400
Why would he do that?

1736
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:16,800
He's 20 years younger to you.

1737
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:24,200
""Lord snatched my love.""

1738
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:25,960
- Waiter.
- Yes sir.

1739
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:28,520
Ask him to stop.

1740
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,320
It seems he is singing on my situation.

1741
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,480
Okay.

1742
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,960
Sir, please stop.

1743
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,560
Table no. 10 is asking to stop.

1744
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:38,680
Stop.

1745
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,120
Stop it.

1746
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:43,760
Zubeida,
I must use the loo urgently.

1747
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:47,000
At your age bladder
stones are pretty normal.

1748
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,120
Radhe Radhe.

1749
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,560
But listen..don't run.

1750
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,520
Goodbye. Love you.

1751
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:07,040
""Your love made my heart alive again.""

1752
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:11,480
""My ailing heat kept crying woefully.""

1753
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:13,960
""I was punished for falling in love...""

1754
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:19,640
""What was my crime that I was robbed.""

1755
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:23,040
""Robbed in your love.""

1756
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:26,720
How is Pooja Mom?

1757
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,560
How does aunty look?

1758
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,960
- Pooja is not her real name.
- What?

1759
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:34,720
Pooja is not her real name.

1760
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:36,600
Yes son.

1761
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,440
Since your mother passed away..

1762
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:42,360
..for the first time I
had feelings for someone else.

1763
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:46,760
But I wonder who jinxed my love?

1764
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,600
Rahul couldn't get his love.

1765
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:54,160
Pooja turned out to be a Muslim.

1766
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:59,200
Her real name is Zubieda
Begum etcetera-etcetera.

1767
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,040
What?

1768
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:02,040
Yes. She has 8 to 10 siblings.

1769
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:04,880
8 to 10.
She must be telling you the time.

1770
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:09,080
No, she wasn't, son.
This is my bad luck.

1771
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,520
We can't get married now.

1772
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:13,920
Don't be absurd, papa.

1773
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,080
Who cares about Hindu and
Muslim in this era?

1774
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,320
- Take Shahrukh and Gauri.
- Yes.

1775
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:19,880
- Aamir and Kiran.
- Yes.

1776
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:21,600
- Saif and Kareena.
- Yes.

1777
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:22,760
Suresh and Hameeda.

1778
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:23,760
Who is Suresh?

1779
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,480
- The guy that sells juice at the corner.
- Oh I see.

1780
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,520
And in fact, take Smiley for instance.

1781
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,640
- Is this Sikhs a Muslim?
- No.

1782
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:34,160
But his fiancÃ© Sakeena is a Muslim.

1783
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,480
What? My fiancÃ© is a Muslim?

1784
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:37,440
Did you forget?

1785
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:38,640
Yes, I did. Remind me.

1786
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:40,040
Sakeena.

1787
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,640
Go ahead and tell papa..

1788
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:45,680
..that you don't have a problem
with your girlfriend being a Muslim.

1789
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:49,160
No. I don't have a problem, uncle.

1790
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:51,040
Muslims are classy people.

1791
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,360
Manners, Love, Care..

1792
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:56,600
But son, marrying a Muslim..

1793
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,720
What if there is a problem..

1794
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,000
You are right.
There is a small problem.

1795
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:01,520
What are you saying?
Where is the problem?

1796
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,840
What are you saying?

1797
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:05,120
Tomorrow when I have kids,
what am I going to call them?

1798
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,560
Razia Chadda, Harpreet Hussain.

1799
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:08,200
They will run around
greeting Insah Allah...

1800
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:09,960
How will that look?
You tell me, uncle.

1801
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,040
You are absolutely right,

1802
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,080
What right?

1803
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:14,680
Children are not born with surnames.

1804
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:17,040
No one congratulates saying,
it's Sharma.

1805
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,000
Congratulations, it's Shukla.

1806
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:20,760
Whether it's Agarwal or Ansari.

1807
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,280
Love by any name is still love.

1808
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,280
You are right.

1809
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,960
Let's assume that Baisakhi
and Eid fall on the same day..

1810
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:27,080
..then what will I eat first?

1811
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,920
- Kidney beans or goat meat.
- True.

1812
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,640
Feed the kidney beans
to the goat and eat the goat.

1813
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:35,000
Radhe-Radhe. What nonsense.

1814
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:37,080
Thousands of goats are
sacrificed on Eid, father.

1815
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,440
What difference will it
make if you offer one at home?

1816
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,280
Think about it.
There is no hurry.

1817
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:45,720
If you believe Hindu, Muslim,

1818
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,040
Christian, Parsi,
Jainism (Religion) are above love.

1819
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,360
Then don't marry her.

1820
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:53,920
Let it be.

1821
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,040
What's going on?
- Where are you going, mom?

1822
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:08,440
- Where are you going, grandma?
- Stay back.

1823
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:09,560
Mom, stop.

1824
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,440
- Aunty, stop.
- Be quiet.

1825
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,280
I will talk to Mahinder.

1826
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,200
I won't stay in this house anymore.

1827
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:16,440
Let's go, Deepak.

1828
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:17,240
Where are you going?

1829
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:18,920
Look..here he is..

1830
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,040
He's an embarrassment to this family.

1831
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:22,320
What is grandma saying?

1832
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,800
We are busy preparing for
my marriage and What are you doing?

1833
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,880
Who is Pooja?
What are these dirty talks?

1834
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,000
What dirty talks?

1835
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:31,440
If that girl comes here, then I won't.

1836
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:33,760
- Let's go, Deepak.
- Stop Deepak.

1837
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:35,040
First, decide what to do.

1838
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,520
It's decided. I love Pooja.

1839
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:41,280
Not every girl that talks dirty
on the phone are characterless, Mahi.

1840
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,960
She understands my feelings,
and I understand hers.

1841
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:45,600
Maybe she was forced into this.

1842
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,200
Maybe some sort of helplessness.

1843
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:48,840
And that's why she
does this kind of job.

1844
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:50,360
Why don't you explain it to her, Mahi?

1845
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:54,040
Do you love her?

1846
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:55,920
Are you sure?

1847
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:04,200
Grandma..

1848
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:08,240
Since brother loves her so much,
then let's meet her up once.

1849
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,320
Fine, If you don't want to meet her
why don't you just talk to her?

1850
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:11,920
There is no need to leave the house.

1851
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,720
Have faith in me, grandma.

1852
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,960
Can I ever do anything wrong?

1853
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:18,440
Fine.

1854
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,520
If you think I am wrong?

1855
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:22,440
Then you stay, and I will leave.

1856
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,040
Stop Mahinder!

1857
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,600
That's my luggage.

1858
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:30,040
Fine. You can keep your luggage.

1859
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:32,400
This is true love, grandma.
You won't understand.

1860
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:33,720
Radhe-Radhe.

1861
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,480
Brother, come back.

1862
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,400
What?

1863
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:40,560
Just say yes, grandma.

1864
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:43,560
Say yes..

1865
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:45,960
Do you love her?

1866
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:48,680
I swear I do.

1867
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:52,120
By the way,
brother, all that time among cows..

1868
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,920
..and buffaloes has made you wise.

1869
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,800
Call sister-in-law.

1870
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:57,080
No. I am feeling embarrassed.

1871
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:58,320
Come on.

1872
01:28:58,400 --> 01:28:59,320
Let it be.

1873
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,880
I already dialled her number.

1874
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,040
Look now..

1875
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:06,120
Rafi's rough copy..

1876
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:08,280
He'll start singing
even if you don't want him to.

1877
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:10,720
Hello.

1878
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,960
Hi Pooja. Grandma wants to talk to you.

1879
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:13,920
Grandma?

1880
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:15,920
Daughter-in-law.

1881
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:17,680
Having a peg, grandma.

1882
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,800
I mean hello, grandma.

1883
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:21,680
God bless you, dear.

1884
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:22,960
What are you doing?

1885
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,040
Watering the plants.

1886
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,440
- At this hour?
- Yes.

1887
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,600
- Let me also talk to her.
- Yes, dear.

1888
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:30,120
Hello..sister-in-law.

1889
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,400
This is Mahi.

1890
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:33,000
Hi.

1891
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:34,880
Your sister-in-law.

1892
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:38,400
- Hi!
- Brother told grandma everything.

1893
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,800
And grandma has agreed
for this marriage.

1894
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:46,640
Since you're watering
your plants, dear, water mine too.

1895
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:50,920
Does everyone in
your house have separate plants?

1896
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:51,920
Yes.

1897
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,400
I'll talk to you later.

1898
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:54,600
Papa is calling.

1899
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:55,960
Okay, bye.

1900
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:59,160
Go and get more water
for papa's plants.

1901
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:01,320
Mahinder told everything to her.

1902
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:04,560
By the way, who told you such
negative things about her?

1903
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:05,280
Right?

1904
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:09,880
I just can't remember
who was the one.

1905
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:16,080
What happened?
Water..

1906
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:17,120
Water..

1907
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,640
Fathers are so unique.

1908
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:28,920
Your father is one in a million.

1909
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,080
Sometimes I wonder..

1910
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:37,640
..how he spent a lifetime alone

1911
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,240
And look at us..

1912
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,440
Whenever we are tensed..

1913
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:44,960
..we start drinking.

1914
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,800
And look at this man.

1915
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:50,160
No cigarette, or alcohol.

1916
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,920
In fact, even if he's ever
had a problem in life..

1917
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:56,200
..he hasn't even told me about it.

1918
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:04,360
Not to mention that
I have caused him so much pain.

1919
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,080
You're right.

1920
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:09,880
He's always scolded me.

1921
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:14,080
But I never felt bad.

1922
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:15,960
I swear..

1923
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,720
We will apologise.

1924
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:34,480
Wake up.

1925
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:37,960
Move.

1926
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,080
Try harder.

1927
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:07,040
Listen, Uncle..

1928
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:08,680
Hello..

1929
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:10,360
Waah..

1930
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,640
Papa, it's you.

1931
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:16,440
From Jagjeet Singh to Mehendi Hassan.

1932
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:19,160
Love is responsible for this makeover.

1933
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:21,760
You gave a complete makeover
to yourself and our ancestral shop.

1934
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:24,200
Feels like happiness
has entered my life.

1935
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:27,920
And no more selling
funeral items and caskets..

1936
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:31,440
..instead your Abba will
promote beautiful lovely items.

1937
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,320
Who Abba?

1938
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:35,000
Me of course.

1939
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:36,600
Your Abba.

1940
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:40,720
That night I had an epiphany..

1941
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:42,600
..and I changed for good.

1942
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,600
And Ismail has the biggest
contribution in this changeover.

1943
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:49,840
Ismail?

1944
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:51,520
No, uncle, Smiley.

1945
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:54,120
Take the 'e' out..so Ismail.

1946
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:57,840
But why paint the house again.

1947
01:32:57,920 --> 01:32:58,920
We just got it painted on Diwali.

1948
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,920
But Eid's coming up, son.

1949
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Our Eid?

1950
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:02,880
Yes..

1951
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:06,800
As you said, millions
of goats are sacrificed on Eid.

1952
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:10,120
One more won't make a difference.

1953
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,040
Look there.
See that..

1954
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:16,400
I've even installed a stanchion
for the goat.

1955
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,320
And son, don't forget
to bring Sakeena over for Eid.

1956
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:22,520
Of course.

1957
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:24,040
Who is that?

1958
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:25,840
You're fiancÃ©.

1959
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:29,400
FiancÃ©.. Sakeena?

1960
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:31,640
- But she can't come over, uncle.
- Why?

1961
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:33,920
She has gone for Hajj to Patiala.

1962
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,200
To Patiala for Hajj?

1963
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:38,320
I mean her aunt and
uncle live in Patiala.

1964
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,480
- She will meet them first
and then leave for Hajj. - I see..

1965
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:41,760
Wonderful. Wonderful.

1966
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,720
Uncle, why are you speaking in Urdu?

1967
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:45,520
Ignorant.

1968
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:49,200
Fix your pronunciation.
It's Urdu.

1969
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:55,280
And Urdu is one of the
finest and smooth language.

1970
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:56,280
And listen.

1971
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:58,440
And on that note here
a few lines from a poet..

1972
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:01,880
""I can spend from dawn to dusk
under the refuge of your tresses.""

1973
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:04,600
""I'll do my duties in this lifetime.""

1974
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:07,360
""If you lock eyes with me,
I'll ask for the consequences.""

1975
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,720
""And if you skirt eyes,
I'll just greet you.""

1976
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,200
Nice. Nice.
But I didn't get it, uncle.

1977
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:13,280
I didn't either.

1978
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,320
What are these bricks for?

1979
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,960
Well, son, I am not a Shahjahan
to build another Taj Mahal.

1980
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:22,480
And your future mother
has a dozen siblings.

1981
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:27,840
So I am making four tombs
up there for her siblings.

1982
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:29,720
- You mean rooms.
- Exactly.

1983
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:32,160
Come Ismail, let me show you.

1984
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:36,960
Take a look. See..

1985
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,440
This is where the rooms
are being constructed.

1986
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:42,000
- They are making the rooms right now.
- Great.

1987
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:44,400
My new family will
also stay here with me.

1988
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,000
And my wife.

1989
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:47,880
What happened, uncle?
Are you all right?

1990
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:51,680
My heart skips a beat
whenever I think of her.

1991
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:54,720
She has a mesmerising
and enchanting voice.

1992
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:56,440
- Really?
- Yes, son.

1993
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:03,720
Greetings.

1994
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:04,800
Yes.

1995
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:06,040
Mind your own business.

1996
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:07,640
I just wanted to say..

1997
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:12,400
..that I am ready
to get married to you.

1998
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:18,840
You know what, send your
father over to fix a wedding date.

1999
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:20,320
My father's out of his limits?

2000
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:21,720
Crossing his limits or
crossing borders for Hajj?

2001
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,680
My father is crossing his limits.

2002
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:27,000
Fine, send him over when he returns.

2003
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:33,760
My son's good friend
Ismail is right here with me.

2004
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:35,360
He is like a kid.

2005
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:36,800
I'll give my greetings to her.

2006
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:39,560
Hello, mammi aunty.

2007
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:40,960
Hang up.

2008
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:42,080
This Jagjeet has lost his mind.

2009
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:44,520
The changes that your
father is going through.

2010
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:47,080
You will repent one day.

2011
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:50,320
Be careful.

2012
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:54,760
Time is so bad, even a dog's
bark sounds like advice to me.

2013
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:58,840
You know,
people like to take a flying arrow..

2014
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,920
..but you've taken a spear.

2015
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:04,640
Your beloved father is
in full mood to get married.

2016
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:05,960
She was the one missing.

2017
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:07,040
Roma.

2018
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:12,440
Hello. How are you doing?

2019
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,520
What's the matter?
You seem to be in a great mood today?

2020
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:17,800
yes, there is good news sister.

2021
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:19,040
Good news?

2022
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:22,240
Yes. I am getting
married to my boyfriend.

2023
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:23,520
What?

2024
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:27,760
This might be good news for you,
but not for me.

2025
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:28,840
Listen..

2026
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,720
- Sign.
- Move.

2027
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:35,360
You know that all men are dogs.

2028
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:37,760
No, no, my boyfriend is not a dog.

2029
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:40,880
He is so naive that he
still smooches me on my head.

2030
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,360
All men pretend to
be naive in the beginning.

2031
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:46,480
I don't want anyone to ruin your life.

2032
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:50,080
Pooja, I don't care if we meet up or
not, but I want to meet up with Anurag.

2033
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:52,560
But why meet up.
You can talk to him on the phone.

2034
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:53,600
Anu baby..

2035
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:54,960
Yes, Pooja.

2036
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:57,480
No. Not on the phone.

2037
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:01,120
Everyone sounds sweet
to me over the phone.

2038
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,200
Tell him I want to meet him tomorrow.
I'll text you the time and place.

2039
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:07,320
And listen.
Try to come over if you can.

2040
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:10,320
Hear me out first..

2041
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:13,280
She has called Pooja's
boyfriend for a meeting.

2042
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:15,160
Happy birthday.

2043
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,400
Firstly a woman, secondly
experienced..

2044
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:19,880
And thirdly a news reporter
and fourthly she is very clever.

2045
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:22,640
From where you'll get
Pooja's boyfriend. Online

2046
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:25,320
You are dead man.

2047
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:27,520
Let's go fast.

2048
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:29,800
Let's go. Have fun.

2049
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:33,360
Hey stop! Over there,
that is Pooja's brother.

2050
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,280
Hey move!

2051
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:47,320
So, where did you meet
Pooja for the first time?

2052
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:48,920
We used to speak on the phone.

2053
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:50,760
And liked the voice very much...

2054
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:53,160
Her voice is mesmerising.

2055
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:55,400
No..she liked my voice very much.

2056
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:59,720
And who proposed whom?

2057
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:02,080
As you can guess from the face,
she did.

2058
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:04,680
But please don't tell her this.

2059
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:16,320
Ohh..sorry.

2060
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:18,840
You came to show
off how decent you are.

2061
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:21,920
Oh no, I don't drink, I never smoked.

2062
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:24,800
Shall I order juice instead?

2063
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,320
Hmm?..

2064
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:28,360
Bloody uncool sh**

2065
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:52,400
Will you judge my decency
by whether I drink or not.

2066
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:55,760
In that case,
you're completely spoiled.

2067
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:59,400
Smoking and drinking
can be bad habits..

2068
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:01,880
..but not signs of
a bad character, ma'am.

2069
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:04,320
How dare you?

2070
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,320
Is this a way you talk to a woman?

2071
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:08,040
I am calling Pooja right now.

2072
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:09,040
Wait!

2073
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:11,480
Call her.

2074
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:13,360
Yes, I am calling her..

2075
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:16,040
I will show you.

2076
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:18,880
How was Anurag?

2077
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,800
Don't mind if he gets a little angry.

2078
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,640
He looks cute even
when he loses his temper.

2079
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:27,040
I knew it.
You will like her too.

2080
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:29,160
- I am so lucky.
- Pooja...

2081
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:32,640
Happy?

2082
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,240
Everyone in this world is wrong.

2083
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,600
The right one is with good intentions.

2084
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,320
And yes..your whiskey
was way more classy than you are.

2085
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,320
And don't forget.

2086
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:46,360
I love Pooja.

2087
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:49,200
And I will marry her.
Will give her my everything. Okay.

2088
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,840
Radhe-Radhe!

2089
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:54,960
Who is she?

2090
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,040
- This place isn't for you.
- But why?

2091
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:01,040
- What are you doing here?
- Shopping.

2092
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:02,120
Of all the places..

2093
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:03,080
Karam.

2094
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,360
Mahi. What are you doing here?

2095
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:07,680
Shopping.

2096
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:08,840
What are you doing here?

2097
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,760
I came here for a meeting.
Let's go.

2098
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:12,240
Oh my, God.

2099
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:14,880
So you are Pooja.

2100
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:16,960
Hi. Roma.

2101
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:20,040
I am not Pooja. I am Mahi.

2102
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:22,000
His future wife.

2103
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:23,120
What?

2104
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:25,000
Bloody two-timer.

2105
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:27,600
You're either cheating on Pooja or her?

2106
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:29,160
- She is drunk.
- What?

2107
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:30,680
- Let's go.
- Hold on.

2108
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,480
She can't talk nonsense
even if she is drunk.

2109
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:33,800
What do you mean?

2110
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:36,440
This man is a fraud and a cheat.

2111
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:38,880
He came to meet me
as Pooja's boyfriend.

2112
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:41,120
Which Pooja are you talking about?

2113
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:44,480
She's my phone-a-friend.

2114
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:46,640
That Pooja.
But I love her.

2115
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,680
Mahi.

2116
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:48,680
What?

2117
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:51,600
But Pooja said she loves Anurag.

2118
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:53,760
I see..
Now, who is this Anurag?

2119
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:55,120
This Anurag.

2120
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:56,880
She is definitely high.

2121
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,480
You are mistaken.
He is not Anurag. He is Karam.

2122
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:01,360
Yes.

2123
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:03,760
He is no Karam. This guy's Anurag.

2124
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:05,600
She is lying. She is lying.

2125
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:06,840
Let's go, Mahi.

2126
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:10,360
If she's lying, Karam,
then why don't you tell us the truth.

2127
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,920
It's a long story, Mahi.
I'll tell you sometime later.

2128
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:13,960
Tell me now, Karam.

2129
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:16,400
- I'll tell you some other day..
- You must clear everything right now!

2130
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,120
You are lying.

2131
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:23,920
Roma.

2132
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:24,880
Pooja.
What's the name.

2133
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,680
- Mahi. Listen to me.
- Brother-in-law.

2134
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:28,720
This is completely unfair.

2135
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,480
- You screwed both of us.
- Get lost.

2136
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:32,320
You get lost.

2137
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:33,240
Move, please.

2138
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:34,920
Mahi. Mahi, listen to me.

2139
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:37,960
Wait. Where are you going?

2140
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:40,040
Give me a chance to explain.
Please..

2141
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:42,920
- Hello, bro..
- Get lost.

2142
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,360
I am in a bad mood.

2143
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:45,760
Ohh, don't spoil my mood.

2144
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:47,760
I meant I am already in a bad mood,
you don't have to spoil yours.

2145
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,000
Please tell me honestly.
How do you know Pooja?

2146
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:51,520
I love Pooja.

2147
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:52,960
How can you love her?

2148
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:55,120
I love Pooja..sister.

2149
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:57,080
What sister?

2150
01:41:57,160 --> 01:42:00,080
The other day you were trying to be so
sturdy. But now you're being so mellow.

2151
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:01,880
You know what he was saying.
He'll hack me to pieces.

2152
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:03,320
- Beat him.
- Beat me.

2153
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:06,160
Come on, beat me. There my
sister Pooja's husband is beating her.

2154
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:07,440
You beat me.

2155
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:08,680
- Pooja's husband?
- Yes.

2156
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:09,840
He's a pain in the neck.

2157
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,960
Pooja never told
me that she is married.

2158
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:15,040
How could she?
His demands never end.

2159
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:16,400
Save her, brother-in-law.

2160
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:18,160
- Brother-in-law?
- Yes.

2161
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:22,240
Now we are family. Don't worry.

2162
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,680
I'll show you how
Gujjar's batter.

2163
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:26,640
This is your brother-in-law's promise.

2164
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:28,240
- Come on.
- Yes, come on.

2165
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:30,360
How dare he touch my Pooja.

2166
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:31,400
Don't come any closer.

2167
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:33,200
Don't..or else I will kill you.

2168
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:34,440
Kill her.

2169
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:37,520
Wiseguy..how dare you touch my Pooja.

2170
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:38,320
Your Pooja.

2171
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:39,360
What is he saying, sister?

2172
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,120
Beat him.

2173
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:41,480
What beat him?
Let's talk.

2174
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:43,920
- Wait. How was the recording?
- Don't ask.

2175
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:45,240
Rickshaw.

2176
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:46,760
- But what happened?
- No one's stopping.

2177
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:48,640
I'll tell you later.
Rickshaw.

2178
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:50,000
Rickshaw.

2179
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:52,320
- Where are you going?
- Wait a minute.

2180
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:55,440
- Where is sister-in-law?
- She is at home.

2181
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:59,720
Order's cancelled.

2182
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:00,960
Rickshaw.

2183
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:03,160
Wait. I have my own bike.

2184
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:08,920
There she is.

2185
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:12,680
Mahi.

2186
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:14,920
Stay with her.
This is not a race.

2187
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,320
Wait a minute.

2188
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:20,640
At least tell me why you're hitting me.

2189
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:22,240
At least tell me why you're hitting me.

2190
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:23,720
What do you want?
- Save me, sister.

2191
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:26,600
No need to worry. I am here now.

2192
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:29,120
Mahi. Mahi, wait.

2193
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:30,800
Listen to me, Mahi.

2194
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:32,040
Lower that volume.

2195
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:35,080
It's Daler Mehndi,
he sings this loud even in low volumes.

2196
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:36,240
Then turn it off.

2197
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:38,400
Mahi, listen.
Listen to me, Mahi.

2198
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:39,880
Just listen to me.

2199
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:41,400
Listen to what, Karam.

2200
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,000
And who are you?

2201
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:44,320
It's me..Toto.

2202
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:45,760
We used to romance over the phone.

2203
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:48,640
I even made a tattoo of your name.
Pujja.

2204
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:51,640
My name is Roma.

2205
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,480
And the spelling is wrong.

2206
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:55,280
But my love is real.

2207
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,520
If you love someone else
then why are you marrying me?

2208
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:00,080
Mahi, I only love
you and not some Pooja.

2209
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:02,480
But you couldn't say
this in front of that girl.

2210
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,560
I had imagined so many
things about you, Karam.

2211
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:06,160
And you are still lying to me.

2212
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,240
What is the confusion?

2213
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:10,880
You say that you love Pooja.
So does he.

2214
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:12,280
Even I love her.

2215
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:13,640
Who is Pooja?

2216
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,120
And why is everyone taking her name?

2217
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:17,280
Oh, God. And you think
I have an affair with her.

2218
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:18,960
Yes. I do.

2219
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:20,640
Mahi.

2220
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:22,040
Mahi, wait.

2221
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:25,240
I don't understand one thing.

2222
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:28,240
You sound so sweet over the phone.

2223
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:30,280
But in reality, you sound a bit hoarse.

2224
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:32,040
You think I sound hoarse.

2225
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:33,640
I said I am not Pooja.

2226
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,800
Save me. Save me.

2227
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:39,480
Catch him.

2228
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,480
This way..

2229
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:42,880
Come on.

2230
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:44,760
Catch him.

2231
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:46,320
What is this Pooja's matter?

2232
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:48,200
Step on it, man.

2233
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:52,560
Pooja. That Anurag is a fraud.

2234
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:54,600
Curse you.
Trying to ruin people's lives.

2235
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:56,240
Bloody drunk woman. Hang up.

2236
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:58,360
Who was that?

2237
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:01,080
- Mahi. Just listen to me.
- No, Karam.

2238
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:02,800
Fine, Then here is the truth.

2239
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:04,400
I love Pooja.

2240
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:06,880
I love her and we're one.
One heart and soul.

2241
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:12,200
- Stop the rickshaw.
- You too.

2242
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:17,440
- What did you say?
- I love you.

2243
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:21,440
Pooja and I are one heart and soul.

2244
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Pooja is that lovely.

2245
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:24,240
Not just me.

2246
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:28,120
Your brother Mahinder as well as
your father-in-law love her a lot.

2247
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:29,280
What?

2248
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:32,560
I do. I do. I do.

2249
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:35,240
The marriage gets solomonized
if you repeat it three times.

2250
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:36,920
I'll say it again louder.

2251
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,120
Do you want the entire city to hear?

2252
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:40,880
If you use up all your
strength at the wedding..

2253
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,640
..then what will you
do on your wedding night?

2254
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:48,520
Payal, Pankhudi, Jyoti, Yasmeen..

2255
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:49,800
Where is Pooja, Karam?

2256
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:51,960
Pooja.

2257
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:55,200
Pooja's here too.

2258
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:58,240
Where, Karam?

2259
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:02,040
Karam?

2260
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:03,680
Karam?

2261
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,160
Hello. Pooja speaking.

2262
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:09,560
How are you?

2263
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:11,600
I am fine.

2264
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:16,760
I'll call you later. Please.

2265
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:18,880
Okay, bye. Love you, take care.

2266
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:29,400
Karam is Pooja.

2267
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,400
Pooja who cannot exist without Karam.

2268
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:36,760
And Karam not without you.

2269
01:46:39,720 --> 01:46:41,640
Why didn't you tell me before?

2270
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:43,600
No job, and debts to pay.

2271
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:50,360
Even I am in love with this Pooja.

2272
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:57,920
Hi, Pooja baby..

2273
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:02,800
'The work that isn't getting
done...something something...'

2274
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:07,040
This is Mahi. My fiancÃ©.

2275
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:08,120
Ohh..

2276
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:10,920
She came to see Pooja.

2277
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:16,400
You told her everything.

2278
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:17,760
Isn't that what you wanted?

2279
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:19,560
This is Mr. W.

2280
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:21,240
He runs this call centre.

2281
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:25,200
He came into my life as a guide
but soon turned selfish.

2282
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:32,160
He threatened to expose me if I quit.

2283
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:33,480
No.

2284
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,640
You are a scum.

2285
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:43,280
You should be grateful to everyone
here, who is a breadwinner for you.

2286
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:45,440
What are you without them?

2287
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:49,680
You sound better than him.

2288
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:53,720
If you're under some kind of debt,
I'll clear it for you.

2289
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:56,600
You..

2290
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,640
Don't forget.

2291
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:03,480
Pooja is a man.

2292
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:28,000
Pooja!

2293
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:36,760
Karam. Karam.

2294
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:38,160
Where are you hiding?

2295
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:40,640
Green house.
I think I am in the wrong house.

2296
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:44,240
Mahinder. Greetings.

2297
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:45,760
How is everyone?

2298
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:48,400
Didn't you recognise me?

2299
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:51,920
It's Jagjeet. Uncle Jagjeet.

2300
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:53,080
Radhe-Radhe Uncle.

2301
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:54,120
Hello.

2302
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:55,080
What happened to you?

2303
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:58,320
Forget about me, what happened to you?

2304
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:00,280
Nothing, uncle. I had a fight.

2305
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:02,440
Sorry to tell you son,
but you got beaten up.

2306
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:03,560
Yes, that.

2307
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:05,640
- What happened?
- I am being wronged.

2308
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:06,480
What happened?

2309
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:08,680
You are so decent and your
son Karam's completely opposite.

2310
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:09,760
What did he do now?

2311
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:12,400
The girl I love and want to marry..

2312
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:13,960
- ..he is chasing after her.
- What?

2313
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:18,920
There's someone else
in his life other than Mahi.

2314
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:19,760
Yes, uncle.

2315
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:20,520
Who?

2316
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:22,160
Her name is Pooja.

2317
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:24,040
Pooja who?

2318
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:28,760
A girl with whom I fell in love
while talking on the phone.

2319
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:31,240
- Phone-a-friend Pooja?
- Yes.

2320
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:32,760
My Pooja.

2321
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:35,120
Exclaims.

2322
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:40,640
My son Karam is romancing
his future mother.

2323
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:42,320
Future mother.
What nonsense.

2324
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:43,960
It's not nonsense.

2325
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:46,040
I am in love with her.

2326
01:49:46,160 --> 01:49:47,440
I am madly in love with her.

2327
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:50,240
And her real name isn't Pooja,
her name is Zubeida.

2328
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:52,600
Radhe-Radhe! What a shameless family.

2329
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:54,280
- What shameless.
- Father and son after the same girl.

2330
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:56,120
Mahinder. Mahinder.

2331
01:49:56,240 --> 01:49:58,000
Uncle, they are the
guys that beat me up.

2332
01:49:58,120 --> 01:49:59,320
Who are you?

2333
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:02,200
Your wedding hasn't been fixed yet..

2334
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:04,800
..and your family members
are already showing up.

2335
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:07,280
Uncle, I am not his family.

2336
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:08,640
I am Pooja's future husband.

2337
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:11,240
- Huh..
- Allah..what kind of a woman is she?

2338
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:13,920
She has entraped every variety of
man.

2339
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:15,160
Except for me.

2340
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:18,240
- Hey, Priest..don't provoke me.
- Get lost.

2341
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:21,000
- Pooja is only mine.
- Hey..

2342
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:23,560
If anyone comes between
Pooja and me then I will kill him.

2343
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:25,720
But son, Zubeida is mine.

2344
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:28,120
- Zubeida who?
- I am leaving.

2345
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:30,840
- Stay seated.
- But I have to pee.

2346
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:32,480
Hold it.

2347
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:35,760
Where on earth did you come from?
Who are you?

2348
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:38,320
- I am here for the wedding.
- Here..

2349
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:40,280
Another one..

2350
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:43,200
I can control my pee..

2351
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:45,480
..but someone control that woman.

2352
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:47,880
That woman has more lovers..

2353
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,920
..than we have devotees in the mosque.

2354
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:51,360
By wedding I mean..

2355
01:50:51,480 --> 01:50:53,520
..Karam called me over to
collect advance for the wedding.

2356
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:55,520
Are you going to play
that DJ at his funeral?

2357
01:50:55,640 --> 01:50:57,080
- What nonsense.
- Advance.

2358
01:50:57,200 --> 01:51:00,320
Get lost. Boys beat him up.

2359
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:02,480
Uncle, we dealt with him.

2360
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:04,360
- Now I will deal with your son.
- No?

2361
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:06,720
You won't lay a finger on my son.

2362
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:08,560
I will deal with my son.

2363
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:11,280
He betrayed his own father.

2364
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:14,800
And romancing with his future mother.
Romancing with his future mother.

2365
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:16,680
I swear I won't spare him.

2366
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:18,840
He betrayed his father.

2367
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:24,760
Mahi, this pretending to be Pooja,
the job at the call centre..

2368
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:27,360
Was I wrong?

2369
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:32,320
I once heard someone say..

2370
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:34,240
Everyone in this world is wrong.

2371
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:36,880
The right one is with good intentions.

2372
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:43,800
Don't think about any of this.

2373
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:45,440
Krishna Leela is today right?.

2374
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:50,920
I want to see how my Krishna
looks when dressed like Radha.

2375
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:58,880
""There goes Radha.""

2376
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:02,040
""There goes Radha.""

2377
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:05,560
""There goes Radha beautifully decked.""

2378
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:08,920
""Krishna is waiting for
her at the banks of Yamuna.""

2379
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:46,120
""Look straight into my eyes..""

2380
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:52,760
""..don't listen to your friends.""

2381
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:58,040
""Look straight into my eyes..""

2382
01:52:58,160 --> 01:53:01,120
""..don't listen to your friends.""

2383
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:02,760
""Love has been around forever.""

2384
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:04,400
""I am the queen and you're my king.""

2385
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:07,960
""Together we stay forever.""

2386
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:09,400
""Radhe..""

2387
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:11,080
""Radhe..""

2388
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:14,560
""Radhe-Radhe-Radhe.""

2389
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:17,800
""Without you Krishna's
love is incomplete.""

2390
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:21,080
""Radhe-Radhe-Radhe.""

2391
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:24,280
""Without you Krishna's
love is incomplete.""

2392
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:27,680
""Radhe-Radhe-Radhe.""

2393
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:31,440
""Without you Krishna's
love is incomplete.""

2394
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:57,440
""Complete and yet
incomplete..such is our tale.""

2395
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:07,160
""Complete and yet
incomplete..such is our tale.""

2396
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:10,400
""Love will live forever..""

2397
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:13,720
""..like the river of Yamuna.""

2398
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:16,760
""Cunning and deceiving are your eyes..""

2399
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:20,320
""..that coyly stare at me.""

2400
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:21,800
""Radhe..""

2401
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:23,560
""Radhe..""

2402
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:26,880
""Radhe-Radhe-Radhe.""

2403
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,160
""Without you Krishna's
love is incomplete.""

2404
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:33,400
""Radhe-Radhe-Radhe.""

2405
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:36,720
""Without you Krishna's
love is incomplete.""

2406
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:40,080
""Radhe-Radhe-Radhe.""

2407
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:43,400
""Without you Krishna's
love is incomplete.""

2408
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:46,560
""Radhe-Radhe-Radhe.""

2409
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:49,720
""Without you Krishna's
love is incomplete.""

2410
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:52,800
""Radhe-Radhe-Radhe.""
Move

2411
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:56,080
""Without you Krishna's love is incomplete.""
- Move from here

2412
01:54:57,800 --> 01:54:58,760
Get lost.

2413
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:00,200
Out. Out.

2414
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:02,880
The show's over. The show's over.

2415
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,080
Stop this charade. Stop it!

2416
01:55:05,200 --> 01:55:08,040
How dare you touch our Karam?

2417
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:08,880
Our Radha?

2418
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:14,040
This Radha is not
worthy of your respect!

2419
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:15,760
If you weren't portraying Radha..

2420
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:17,640
..I would've turned
this place into your grave.

2421
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:18,800
Hold on.

2422
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:20,680
Tell me what has he done.

2423
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:21,920
Murder.

2424
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:23,800
- Murder?
- Murder?

2425
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,360
Yes...My Pooja's murder.

2426
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:28,360
Uncle.

2427
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:30,640
And this man must have told you this.

2428
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:33,080
Karam can never kill Pooja.

2429
01:55:33,320 --> 01:55:34,240
He is lying.

2430
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:37,240
It's not a lie.
I am sure he killed Pooja.

2431
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:39,480
He came to the hospital to threaten me.

2432
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:42,160
And he claimed that
he will hack Pooja to pieces.

2433
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:43,320
Come on.

2434
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:45,680
My life's trapped in a cage,
waiting to break free.

2435
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:48,080
To destroy myself..in love.

2436
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:51,600
Let me taste your sweet
voice with my ears..

2437
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:53,760
..be the sweet nectar of my love.

2438
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:01,360
How do you know this poetry?

2439
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:04,800
Only Pooja and I know about it.

2440
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:08,440
Even I knew Pooja.

2441
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:11,320
She was very nice.

2442
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:13,240
Where did he go?

2443
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:14,360
Where did he go?

2444
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:16,920
- Catch him.
- Don't let him go.

2445
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,200
Check there.

2446
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:20,600
- Catch him.
- I won't run!

2447
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:28,360
Even I loved Pooja.

2448
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:30,200
Then why did you kill her?

2449
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:35,280
If I can create her,
then I can kill her.

2450
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:43,800
This little bundle of joy and
a great friend had to die one day.

2451
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:47,040
She could easily win over people.

2452
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:50,440
When Pooja used to say..

2453
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:52,600
""Hello..""

2454
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:54,800
""Pooja speaking.""

2455
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:07,720
I am Pooja.

2456
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,840
When I got talking to people,
I realised..

2457
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:18,080
..that our population might be
increasing, but so is loneliness.

2458
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:22,160
Today we have thousands of friends
over Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

2459
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:25,560
But do you have one
true friend in real life?

2460
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:32,480
Someone who can listen to you,
understand you?

2461
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:35,760
And this loneliness
has increased to an extent..

2462
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:39,560
..that no one bothers
to take a family picture.

2463
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:42,960
Everyone's only worried about selfies.

2464
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:47,040
And for these lonely people,
along came..

2465
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:48,800
..this Pooja.

2466
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:52,760
While talking to people
I gradually understood..

2467
01:57:54,760 --> 01:57:58,280
..that every person
in this world needs Pooja.

2468
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:01,440
And Pooja is not a gender.

2469
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:07,800
Anyone like your friends,
family, relatives, wife, children..

2470
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:10,680
Anyone can be your Pooja.

2471
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:13,760
Someone you can open your heart to.

2472
01:58:14,680 --> 01:58:19,720
Someone who can make you
realise that you are not alone.

2473
01:58:22,040 --> 01:58:24,480
And the day you find your Pooja..

2474
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:31,280
..you won't need some
phone-a-friend Pooja anymore.

2475
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:37,880
Now, do all of you
know the truth of Pooja?

2476
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:41,440
Now, what is Mr. W's truth?

2477
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:45,680
He will only be able
to tell us where Pooja is.

2478
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:48,040
I just did. He must have killed her.

2479
01:58:48,120 --> 01:58:50,040
Leave me. -Come on
-Leave me.

2480
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:52,400
She is the real Pooja.

2481
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:56,120
Tell them. Tell them the truth.

2482
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:57,760
I am Pooja.

2483
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:01,320
And Mr. W paid me to do this.

2484
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:04,040
You bloody..

2485
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:08,320
Trying to make a fool out of me,
are you?

2486
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:11,600
Arrest him. Take him away.

2487
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:18,040
Let's go.

2488
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:25,280
I have a question.

2489
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:27,480
Are you Pooja?

2490
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:30,400
Yes.

2491
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:31,560
Marry me.

2492
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:32,760
Here.

2493
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:34,680
Rajpal Kirar.

2494
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:36,040
You think your wife's too short.

2495
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:37,760
You should be thankful
that you got married.

2496
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:39,600
- Really?
- No romance at home.

2497
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:40,640
Always arguing.

2498
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:43,440
If you stay out all night working,
then where will the romance come from.

2499
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:45,880
My sweet naive Mahinder.

2500
01:59:46,160 --> 01:59:49,000
- Come here, my super singer.
- Hey Brother-in-law, listen to me.

2501
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:50,280
Marry me. Marry me.
- No..No

2502
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:52,080
- Trying to woo girls with your voice.
- No.

2503
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:53,680
If a good voice was
enough to woo girls..

2504
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:56,200
..then no singer would
ever focus on singing.

2505
01:59:56,280 --> 01:59:58,160
- I made a mistake sorry..
- Maary me come on.

2506
01:59:58,240 --> 02:00:00,560
Toto..where are you going?

2507
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:05,800
You know those sweet messages
children write on wedding cards.

2508
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:07,960
You're even younger than those kids.

2509
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:09,320
Minor

2510
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:13,440
Ma'am. You've lost faith in men.

2511
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:18,080
Just because you had three bad bananas,
you want to crush the entire bunch.

2512
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:20,360
You should be ashamed.

2513
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:22,880
All of you should be ashamed.

2514
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:25,720
To become crazy about my innocent son.

2515
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:26,880
Ignorants.

2516
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:28,600
O Uncle.

2517
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:29,760
Yes.

2518
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:32,760
Papa aka Rahul aka
Jagjeet aka Mehendi Hassan.

2519
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:35,600
Dreaming of a honeymoon
when you should be praying.

2520
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:39,840
Son..i made a big mistake.

2521
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:42,600
Swear on that benevolent Lord.

2522
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:49,480
I had no clue that I was dreaming
about my own son to my bride.

2523
02:00:49,560 --> 02:00:53,040
Wow..
So strong Urdu vocabulary

2524
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:56,120
I've been trying to teach this
man computers for past three years.

2525
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:57,320
But he couldn't learn.

2526
02:00:57,640 --> 02:00:59,440
But you learnt Urdu
for a girl in three days.

2527
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:01,960
And he turned Mathura
into mini Karachi.

2528
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:03,240
Marry me.

2529
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:04,640
Marry me.
Who is it going to marry me?

2530
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:07,160
Marry me.
Kirar sir. Marry me.

2531
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:09,960
Marry me.
Madam, you marry me.

2532
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:13,560
- Who wants to marry me?
- I do.

2533
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:28,920
I've been asking you
to marry me for so long.

2534
02:01:34,680 --> 02:01:37,320
""Dance with me..""

2535
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:39,800
""Dance with me..""

2536
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:42,400
""Come dance with me..""

2537
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:45,000

2546
02:02:21,720 --> 02:02:26,920
""You're a soft-hearted boy,
and I am a hottie.""

2547
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:31,560
""Why do you get jealous
if anyone wants to be my friend?""

2548
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:37,200
""You're a soft-hearted boy,
and I am a hottie.""

2549
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:42,400
""Why do you get jealous
if anyone wants to be my friend?""

2550
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:57,080
""My mood makes my heart high.""

2551
02:02:57,160 --> 02:03:02,280
""As you sway that waist,
the boy's go crazy.""

2552
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:05,040
""Your face is sweet,
you're the one for me.""

l am not wo_hy of it.

199
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,533
Chimman echoe_ the ._entiment..

200
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,402
That's when l decided
l've ootta chanoe my wo_h. .

201
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,534
You can use me. all you want..

202
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:28,868
But we ootta be pa_ners.

203
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:31,601
There i._ thi._ man l want..

204
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:32,767
You'll oet him..

205
00:32:33,066 --> 00:32:35,201
but you don't oet anythino for free..

206
00:32:35,733 --> 00:32:37,568
You don't get to play my
probono daddy..

207
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,135
nor do l wanna be
your ''Tax free'' Johnny.

208
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:43,200
Romi Mehta.

209
00:32:43,366 --> 00:32:45,000
Mayor of Bombay.

210
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:48,503
He's got the hotline to the
Prime Mini._ter in Delhi.

211
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:53,237
He's more indispensable to Bombay than
the Chief Mini._ter or the Governor.

212
00:32:59,566 --> 00:33:02,135
One day a tram rammed his car..

213
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:06,070
and that was the last time,
the trams plied in this city.

214
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:10,202
He has a middle man. a procurer..

215
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:12,134
who is a horndoo.

216
00:33:12,466 --> 00:33:13,967
lf he's made to disappear..

217
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,368
Romi Mehta would need a
replacement for him.

218
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:19,869
that horndog does not take
hi._ broad._ to a love motel..

219
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:23,068
he prefers to take them
in the open.

220
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,136
Hiral will lure him to the creek.

221
00:33:27,066 --> 00:33:28,267
Who'._ Hiral?

222
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:30,000
My wife.

223
00:33:31,133 --> 00:33:32,167
Mi._._u._.

224
00:33:56,866 --> 00:33:59,435
When bodies decompose..

225
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,001
they bloat up. And they float up.

226
00:34:01,633 --> 00:34:04,002
which is why you stab the
body to puncture it.

227
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,835
Drown that horndoo into the creek.

228
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:09,267
Will you?

229
00:34:33,933 --> 00:34:35,968
The other man l want to oet to..

230
00:34:36,266 --> 00:34:37,967
but not dead. alive.

231
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:40,001
Rao Saheb De._ai.

232
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:43,603
His inteority can't be bouoht..

233
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,302
so we need to click a picture of his.

234
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,035
Bombay is called the golden bird,
not for nothino.

235
00:35:39,133 --> 00:35:43,036
So much money flows here
that bank._ can't hol_ it.

236
00:35:43,133 --> 00:35:46,669
We need to create a place
that can ''._ta._h the ca._h''.

237
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,668
Where whisky and women
flow and sino..

238
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:50,000
and we talk shop.

239
00:35:50,533 --> 00:35:51,867
Business. l mean.

240
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:54,569
Basically, an exclusive
oentlemen's club.

241
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:59,869
l did not understand a word
of your Enolish!

242
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:02,533
Hey!

243
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:04,535
You want to be a Bio Shot?

244
00:36:05,366 --> 00:36:07,034
l'll make you a Bio Shot.

245
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,134
My place.

247
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,501
Take a good look at
these photos.

neoatives.

249
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,635
And you will find them somewhere
in thi._ new club.

with you forever.

252
00:36:49,533 --> 00:36:52,068
And is now Khambatta's flunky.

253
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,504
Above all my desires

00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:10,769

255
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:16,070

Or i._ thi._ an illu._ion?

257
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:24,705
Oh. sweet enchanter!

258
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:34,309
Bewitched by your thought,

Beneath this happy face,

00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:21,504
Oh ._weet enchanter!

264
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:10,775
Let our inflamed passion enoulf us

265
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:18,540
Let me surrender to your spell,
Oh ._weet enchanter.

266
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:30,109
The fire's burnt out. my love

Your coldness is tormenting me,
l can't bear the sleepless niohts.

269
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:57,307
My love is for real,

278
00:40:41,533 --> 00:40:43,902
Wh_d ya love me so much?

279
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:50,534
You could have loved anyone.

into you.

281
00:40:53,566 --> 00:40:55,801
We all feel something looking
into people.

282
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:58,534
Hmm..

283
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,769

You give me a hundred and

Rosie is DND,

Par._ee man!

304
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:13,071
lf you wanna get a drink
in this city..

305
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:15,568
you need an alcohol permit.
It's compulsoy.

306
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:18,969
But when have we ever
followe_ rule._.

307
00:43:19,066 --> 00:43:24,337
The last Mughal king formally

Out of the way.

We made a deal all those
years aoo..

312
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,435
lf Rosie ever came with me..
l'll never see your face.

313
00:43:41,133 --> 00:43:44,870
So why the hell do you
show up here eveyday?

314
00:43:51,433 --> 00:43:53,368
Fine feathers
_on't make fine bir_._.

00:43:53,433 --> 00:43:55,935
Your language still

You keep the feathers.

320
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,903
The Scotch that was brought in
from the back alley of Bombay Velvet.

321
00:44:30,866 --> 00:44:34,869
ln spite of the spectacular glitter that
enters Bombay Velvet from its orand front..

322
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:37,968
lt's not enough to blind me from
what really ooes on.

323
00:44:39,866 --> 00:44:45,771
The powerhouses of Bombay seem
really happy in paid company and free liauor..

324
00:44:47,066 --> 00:44:50,803
trading lives of
million._ of Mill worker._..

325

over an evening of music
an_ chatter.

326
00:44:54,266 --> 00:44:58,303
And your effo_s in adding some
much needed olitter to the rot.

327
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:04,605
PS: Putting a stitched suit on Johnny
Balrai makes him look oood but..

328
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,272
that street side local will never

329
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:28,641
Hot headed hawk,

330
00:45:39,933 --> 00:45:43,903
Hide it if you could,

342
00:47:10,933 --> 00:47:14,803
Hot headed hawk,

343
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:21,204
Hide it if you could,

00:49:27,133 --> 00:49:29,034
- We will not allow the millworker._..

369
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,969
to take away our livelihood,
and build them._elve._ a fo_une.

370
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,469
We have built this city..
With our bloo_ an_ ._weat.

371
00:49:34,533 --> 00:49:38,270
And we will not allow them their feast
while we oo hunoy.

372
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,802
They cannot shutdown the
cotton mill._..

373
00:49:40,866 --> 00:49:46,204
to build their ivoy towers..
It's our money..

374
00:49:52,033 --> 00:49:53,434
To hell with it.

375
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:07,737
Johnny, what are you wearing?
You look like hired help.

376
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:09,167
Lo._e the bomie.

377
00:50:24,433 --> 00:50:27,702
Does he know that you and Jimmy
used to hook up?

378
00:50:39,533 --> 00:50:44,304
- We want our share of the profit.

379
00:50:44,633 --> 00:50:48,670
We had no money for the oas..

380
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:54,204
Our cars iust stood there..

381
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,868
Unlike you..

382
00:50:58,466 --> 00:51:00,267
We ha_ a lot to lo._e..

383
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,436
Our honour. our family name..

384
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,935
At 17, l was thrust
the responsibility..

385
00:51:08,366 --> 00:51:11,736
to take care of Khambattas,
and our newspaper.

386
00:51:13,433 --> 00:51:15,902
Jimmy and me, grew up together..
But had different iourneys.

387
00:51:16,666 --> 00:51:20,770
He thinks l am an American spy,
a capitalist.

388
00:51:21,366 --> 00:51:23,735
while l know how Russians
cover hi._ a._._..

389
00:51:24,066 --> 00:51:25,967
while l slogged for my
newspaper to orow. .

390
00:51:26,066 --> 00:51:28,601
He went and married the
handicapped dauohter. .

391
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:32,769
of a wealthy father.

392
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:36,735
Wants to topple the government with
Russian money.. Bloody socialist!

393
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,768
That mill worker._' union lea_er..

394
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,869
is his doo.

395
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:43,500
What's your point. boss?

396
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,001
My point is..

397
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:48,669
Bomba_s map is being
redrawn. Johnny.

398
00:51:49,133 --> 00:51:51,101
Seven i._lan_._..

399
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:53,067
We fille_ in the creek._..

400
00:51:53,133 --> 00:51:54,200
Seven became one.

401
00:51:54,933 --> 00:51:56,000
Bombay.

402
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:59,136
And now this reclaimed land
is up for orabs.

403
00:51:59,233 --> 00:52:02,603
A bio investment oppo_unity.

404
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,768
Jimmy is aoainst this development..

405
00:52:04,866 --> 00:52:06,267
But the mill owner._ are with u._.

406
00:52:06,466 --> 00:52:08,301
How do we make more money?

407
00:52:08,933 --> 00:52:11,001
What mu._t we _o?

408
00:52:19,433 --> 00:52:20,333
Mr. Mayor.

409
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,568
Aren't we wasting the
backbay land?

410
00:52:22,666 --> 00:52:25,602
By putting the World Trade Centre
in Nariman Point..

411
00:52:25,699 --> 00:52:28,235
We're throwing away
prime prope_y!

412
00:52:28,566 --> 00:52:31,902
l have the urban development
mini._ter under control..

413
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,702
l have him on camera with my wife.

414
00:52:35,033 --> 00:52:36,734
Now he is playino ball.

415
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:38,568
l mean it's a loss of a
business oppo_unity..

416
00:52:38,666 --> 00:52:39,933
look at that lan_.

417
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:45,537
Had me smitten and left in despair,
even in love. well. that's not fair.

418
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:53,607
Your pride will fall,
becau._e love tower._ all.

419
00:52:54,233 --> 00:52:58,570
Disreoard is as you may

420
00:52:58,666 --> 00:53:03,404
you'll surrender one day,
for your raoe is futile.

421
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,135
Mr. Mayor?
- Johnny Balrai.

422
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:11,671
Hide it if you could,
flaunt it if you should.

423
00:53:11,766 --> 00:53:15,136
This rage, my love,
ain't no oood!

424
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:18,970
- Mayor needs the cigars..
And one of the oirls in the back room.

425
00:53:26,233 --> 00:53:29,102
The World Trade Centre
is beino relocated.

426
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,169
and our paper did not know that..

427
00:53:32,866 --> 00:53:36,469
l got it from
Khambatta's paper TORRENT..

428
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:54,604
The World Trade Centre that
was to come up at Nariman Point. .

429
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:02,771
The Committee has decided
to relocate it at Cuffe Parade.

430
00:54:02,866 --> 00:54:05,835
- Our hunoer for land is so enormous..

431
00:54:05,933 --> 00:54:09,102
that filling the creeks did not
satisfy it.. nor cuttino the iunoles..

432
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:12,736
and now we are asking the sea
to move back..

433
00:54:13,933 --> 00:54:15,868
so you can reclaim it..
Not you mate.

434
00:54:15,933 --> 00:54:18,869
Except the
Worl_ Tra_e Centre relocation..

435
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:29,076
Rest of the Nariman point remains
exactly as planned.

436
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,235
lf the World Trade Centre
is to oo to Cuffe Parade. .

437
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,468
What becomes of the reclaimed land
at Nariman Point?

438
00:54:34,766 --> 00:54:36,234
Manhattan!

439
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:38,702
And who is gonna
build the Manhattan?

440
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,901
Who gets the allotment of the
hioh value land..

441
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,169
You'll find all the details
in the press release.

442
00:54:57,766 --> 00:55:00,301
Check this picture..
Recoonize the ouy?

443
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:06,437
The one we photographed
orabbino melons..

444
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:08,801
Didja know
he wa._ a mini._ter?

445
00:55:09,866 --> 00:55:11,200
We will oet our share too.

446
00:55:13,033 --> 00:55:15,368
Not if we wait for it,
we won't.

447
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,535
When a movie is sold out,
Only those find a ticket..

448
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,836
Who knows when and where to
orab the manaoer.

449
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:25,302
l still haven't got those
neoatives.

450
00:55:26,166 --> 00:55:28,668
The Mayor forced me to
announce the _C relocation..

451
00:55:28,733 --> 00:55:30,334
they have me playing
the oame.

452
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,934
lf you don't find the neoatives..

453
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,369
forget our dream of affordable
housino for mill workers.

454
00:55:34,466 --> 00:55:36,301
That union leader will
buy us time.

455
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:37,867
Don't wory.

456
00:55:37,966 --> 00:55:41,836
They still pay us the same wages
that the British paid us..

457
00:55:41,933 --> 00:55:45,536
and with the increased maroins..

458
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:48,235
they are gonna build a
city for the rich.

459
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:51,402
On our oraves..

460
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,369
On our bloo_..

461
00:55:54,466 --> 00:55:58,636
We will not let them have
their Manhattan.

462
00:55:58,666 --> 00:56:02,369
No homes for Zurich's gnomes.
- No homes. no homes.

463
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,002
We want our share of profit
in our han_._.

464
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:06,534
Why the Red flao?

465
00:56:06,633 --> 00:56:09,068
Red is socialist.
Why not the democratic Indian flao?

466
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:12,135
That's Khambatta's flunky,
shoot his picture.

467
00:56:12,466 --> 00:56:14,901
When God was distributing the
''Sma_._''..

468
00:56:14,966 --> 00:56:17,735
the union leader was
standino there with a sieve.

469
00:56:18,066 --> 00:56:21,102
Poor fellow wants to be a
Mahatma like Gan_hi..

470
00:56:21,166 --> 00:56:24,469
and since there are
no Enolishmen left to fioht. .

471
00:56:24,566 --> 00:56:26,768
He is fighting the
Enolish-speakino men.

472
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:30,736
l have been watching those immigrants,
ever since l came to this city.

473
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,403
l used to wonder why the hell,
do they waste time fillino the sea.

474
00:56:35,466 --> 00:56:38,235
Now l know.
They were bakino a bi_hday cake.

475
00:56:40,866 --> 00:56:43,602
For the pa_y of the bio boys..

476
00:56:45,133 --> 00:56:51,606
but the bi_hday boy can't blow
the candle._ without me.

477
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,135
As lono as l have this..

478
00:56:58,533 --> 00:57:01,569
Khambatta will either give me a
piece of action..

479
00:57:02,766 --> 00:57:04,601
Or kill me.

480
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,536
Keep it with you.
Keep it safe.

481
00:57:13,699 --> 00:57:14,834
No.

482
00:57:16,066 --> 00:57:18,067
What if l lo._e it?

483
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,903
Who asked you to sta_
this protest?

484
00:57:31,966 --> 00:57:33,500
My ''Principal..''

485
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,700
Who'._ he?

486
00:57:36,666 --> 00:57:38,401
l mean Ideolooy.

487
00:57:39,566 --> 00:57:42,502
We got these biscuits
specially for you.

488
00:57:45,533 --> 00:57:47,735
What's Backbay got to do
with your mills?

489
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:50,902
Backbay is the south end of Bombay and
your mills are far away in the centre.

490
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,101
l _on't ._ee the connection.

491
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:54,669
You think l don't know
whose money is beino used..

492
00:57:54,966 --> 00:57:58,002
to build those buildinos.

493
00:57:58,066 --> 00:58:00,401
All the mill owners
are puttino in tenders.

494
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,702
They say they don't have money
to pay our salaries..

495
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,468
but they have it to make
the skyscraper.

496
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,002
What's your ideology wo_h?
Name your price.

497
00:58:11,266 --> 00:58:12,734
Eveyone has a price.

498
00:58:13,033 --> 00:58:16,302
l charge Rs.1000 for an
hour in cou_.

499
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:18,501
l've left a hearing
to be here.

500
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:21,135
Tell me your price.

501
00:58:27,633 --> 00:58:30,135
Sory to waste your 15 minutes..

502
00:58:30,733 --> 00:58:34,036
and your 250 rupees tea.

503
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,268
Hello Ro._ie..

504
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,268
First time l paid a bribe today..

505
00:58:47,766 --> 00:58:49,968
iust to find your phone number.

506
00:58:50,033 --> 00:58:52,101
l tried callino you..

507
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:54,101
At your sea-front house.
But..

508
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:55,934
What were you ooino to tell me?

509
00:58:58,333 --> 00:59:01,002
That you found nothing?
Or that you'll tell me nothino?

510
00:59:01,266 --> 00:59:05,303
You were sent there
to find those neoatives. .

511
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,467
l ._ometime._ won_er..

512
00:59:06,566 --> 00:59:09,368
Why don't l just tell your Romeo..
Who you really are..

513
00:59:11,566 --> 00:59:14,702
This city will go to the dogs, Rosie,
if we don't find those neoatives.

514
00:59:14,766 --> 00:59:18,269
You are the star of Bombay Velvet
because l made you one.

515
00:59:18,366 --> 00:59:23,871
My paper talked you up, talked
up your Romeo's sordid speakeasy.

516
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:26,602
l sent you there to do a iob.

517
00:59:27,099 --> 00:59:28,868
One tiny little iob.

518
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,034
The iob that you foroot.

519
00:59:33,066 --> 00:59:38,337
You don't find those damn negatives
and l'll expose you. Rosie.

520
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:42,135
There'._ ._omeone at the _oor.

521
00:59:57,533 --> 00:59:58,667
What i._ it?

522
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:00,668

01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,835
l felt someone
ha_ come to kill me.

524
01:00:07,866 --> 01:00:08,766
Johnny.

525
01:00:10,566 --> 01:00:11,400
Tell me.

526
01:00:14,099 --> 01:00:15,100
What i._ it?

527
01:00:18,766 --> 01:00:20,734
Take me away from Bombay.

528
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:25,669
You nuts?
You know what's outside Bombay?

529
01:00:27,866 --> 01:00:29,100
ln_ia.

530
01:00:29,766 --> 01:00:32,602
And you know that India is
sta_ed and poor.

531
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:38,436
Here.. We grow eveyday..
From small to laroe..

532
01:00:38,933 --> 01:00:40,834
now it's time to hit by size..

533
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,534

01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:46,535

did you know him?

535

And you ootta say:

536
01:00:50,066 --> 01:00:52,535
He used to be a bio shot.

537

My forger can make
one for me easily.

546
01:01:20,766 --> 01:01:22,334
Builders put up buildinos..

547
01:01:22,366 --> 01:01:23,400
That's what they do.

548
01:01:23,866 --> 01:01:25,601
They mix sand with cement.

549
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:29,336
The mayor brings in the politics..
While the mill owners put up the money.

550
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,202
What have you got to offer,
Johnny?

lt's because you know what l can

ln two days, the millworkers
will staoe a huoe protest rally.

557
01:01:59,866 --> 01:02:03,135
lf that rally happens,
there will be no more Manhattan.

558
01:02:03,666 --> 01:02:06,035
The union leader has to oo..

559
01:02:06,133 --> 01:02:07,434
make him disappear.

560
01:02:07,533 --> 01:02:11,770
Then this whole movement will flounder
like a headle._._ chicken and die out.

561
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:40,203
Union leader will buy us time?
What'._ thi._ now?

562
01:02:47,933 --> 01:02:49,267
He'._ uncon._ciou._.

563

Do you know what it is

You and Khambatta both can't blackmail
the minister over the same pictures.

629
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:38,934
Why not?

630
01:07:39,266 --> 01:07:41,935
l can not let Khambatta mock my English
and not pay me. what's owed to me..

631

l gotta teach him my
Ianouaoe now.

But know that
he won't take it lyino down.

So what ._houl_ l _o?

635
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:51,934
The only way l know..

636
01:07:51,966 --> 01:07:53,934
is you want something,
you kill for it.

637
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,267
Who are you ooino to kill?

638
01:07:55,433 --> 01:07:56,300

You didn't say a word when

You prefer me
not askino auestions..

845
01:20:37,133 --> 01:20:39,201
You preferred me
when l was your toy..

846
01:20:40,166 --> 01:20:42,167
No wonder you married
a cripple.

847
01:20:47,399 --> 01:20:49,468
The Johnny you call a street hood..

You have no idea what will be

851
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:11,136
Does he know he isn't the
first man you slept with?

Does he know that

Do you know you aren't

lf you're infected,
you're on your own!

Love is a deadly plaoue!

856

For those infected,
nothino cures better than liauor.

857
01:22:14,233 --> 01:22:20,906
When god isn't holy enough,
the love_s picture on the wall is.

858
01:22:21,399 --> 01:22:25,070
Seems harmless. but is really lethal.

859
01:22:34,033 --> 01:22:37,403
Love is a deadly plaoue!

860
01:22:44,866 --> 01:22:46,567

01:27:30,933 --> 01:27:35,570
Wandering hopelessly
Dhadam! Dhadam!

887
01:27:36,033 --> 01:27:40,370
My aching hea_ echoes
Dha_am! Dha_am!

888
01:27:40,433 --> 01:27:44,737
This insufferable pain!

889
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:47,109
l had so much to say,
the aoony l lived this far.

890
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:57,843
But you shut me up,
held me captive in a vow.

891
01:28:57,933 --> 01:29:02,971
And now you're sore

892
01:29:03,033 --> 01:29:08,872
That l betrayed you?

893
01:29:10,133 --> 01:29:19,675
l'll still love you anynray,
it's your apathy that hu_s!

894
01:29:20,399 --> 01:29:24,604
My aching hea_ explodes
Dhadam! Dhadam!

895
01:29:24,666 --> 01:29:29,971
This insufferable pain!

896
01:29:52,033 --> 01:29:59,440
You turned away,
broke me in ._hard._.

897
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:02,135
How inseparable were we

898
01:30:02,233 --> 01:30:09,540
Losino you has tauoht me

899
01:30:10,066 --> 01:30:12,535
how unbearably poor
l'm without you

900
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:23,811
My hea_'s a lonely dese_,
embrace me in your cloud.

901
01:30:25,066 --> 01:30:29,136
Let the rain pound
Dhadam! Dhadam!

902
01:30:30,066 --> 01:30:33,602
Wandering hopelessly
Dhadam! Dhadam!

903
01:30:33,966 --> 01:30:35,400
Where's the Maior?

904
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,335
How do l care?
He took his baos and left.

905
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:39,600
Come with me.

906
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:41,868
Where are you takino me?

907
01:31:06,699 --> 01:31:09,335
My aching hea_
Dha_am! Dha_am!

908
01:31:09,399 --> 01:31:11,869
Relentless echo
Dha_am! Dha_am!

909
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:16,670
Like beino on a death row

910
01:31:17,166 --> 01:31:19,735
My aching hea_
Dha_am! Dha_am!

911
01:31:19,833 --> 01:31:22,268
Holding me by the neck
Dhadam! Dhadam!

912
01:31:22,366 --> 01:31:27,104
Countino my last hours

913
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:35,975
Dha_am! Dha_am!

914
01:31:43,399 --> 01:31:49,272
This insufferable pain!

915
01:32:15,333 --> 01:32:18,436
Rosie Noronha.
She used to sino in Bombay Velvet.

916
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,535
A twisted bunch. this lot.

917
01:32:28,733 --> 01:32:30,401
Banoles. Sir.

918
01:32:32,033 --> 01:32:33,467
They were found on the body.

919
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:37,135
- Why bomb the whole place?
Ju._t to kill Ro._ie?

920
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:39,001
A bullet woul_ have _one it.

921
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:40,000
Get out.

922
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:41,601
Go write your piece.

923
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:50,601
And take that away.

924
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:01,968
The one truth
l can vouch for i._..

925
01:33:02,033 --> 01:33:05,136
They were madly in love..

926
01:33:05,933 --> 01:33:07,968
Ju._t like Romeo-Juliet.

927
01:33:08,533 --> 01:33:10,468
You know what l
actually think?

928
01:33:11,233 --> 01:33:15,236
Maybe the_ve had a nasty
Iove_._ brawl.

929
01:33:15,666 --> 01:33:17,834
Maybe?
Or did they?

930
01:33:18,699 --> 01:33:20,134
But l am sure of one thino..

931
01:33:22,433 --> 01:33:25,102
Now tell the stoy.
The real one.

932
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:27,969
Sir, Rosie was vey drunk
that nioht.

933
01:33:28,066 --> 01:33:30,701
She just couldn't stop weeping,
all throuoh the way.

934
01:33:30,766 --> 01:33:33,401
l said: Let me help you to the door
but she oot anoy.

935
01:33:33,833 --> 01:33:35,401
Tell you the truth?

936
01:33:35,466 --> 01:33:39,136
l loved her,
with all my hea_.

937
01:33:39,433 --> 01:33:41,835
But Johnny was her world.

938
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:45,235
She got really mad
that day.

939
01:33:45,333 --> 01:33:47,101
l said: let me walk you
to the door..

940
01:33:47,233 --> 01:33:49,535
l asked you to leave,
didn't l?

941
01:33:51,066 --> 01:33:52,734
My hea_ broke that day.

942
01:33:52,833 --> 01:33:57,971
Rosie, Madame, l can't bear it
when l see you cy...

943
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:05,069
l know you love Johnny.

944
01:34:08,166 --> 01:34:10,801
But l am iust a chauffeur..

945
01:34:11,366 --> 01:34:14,335
Tony. ''The chauffeuf'.

946
01:34:16,333 --> 01:34:19,769
- Someone strangled her before
that bomb exploded.

947
01:34:19,833 --> 01:34:24,270
- The body didn't blow up 'cos the heavy
synthetic dress melted over her body.

948
01:34:24,633 --> 01:34:27,902
- Even if she had su_ived the explosion,
she would have died in 2 years.

949
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,601
- She ha_ Gonorrhoea.

950
01:34:32,866 --> 01:34:35,602
Do we have anything that can
prove this mioht not be Rosie?

951
01:34:35,666 --> 01:34:36,767
No. sir.

952
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:39,901
Okay.
Sion the papers.

953
01:34:41,466 --> 01:34:43,067
And hand over the body
to the family.

954
01:35:19,699 --> 01:35:22,069
Madame Rosie?
- That'._ her ._i._ter.

955
01:35:34,233 --> 01:35:36,068
Johnny!

956
01:35:39,533 --> 01:35:41,434
Leave the drink.
Get chanoed!

957
01:35:42,266 --> 01:35:43,834
l didn't betray you. Johnny.

958
01:35:43,933 --> 01:35:45,934
Rosie, if you want to live,
do as l say!

959
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,468
Take off your clothes now.

960
01:35:47,766 --> 01:35:49,767
Chanoe into my clothes.

961
01:35:52,233 --> 01:35:54,268
Johnny..

962
01:35:54,566 --> 01:35:55,900
What's ooino on?

963
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:04,736
No!
- Ro._ie there'._ a bomb in the hou._e.

964
01:36:04,833 --> 01:36:07,835
We can exit from the door.
- Rosie. iump!

965
01:36:17,399 --> 01:36:18,400
Who was that oirl?

966
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:20,134
That was Rosie.
An_ ._he'._ _ea_.

967
01:36:20,199 --> 01:36:21,200
But l'm alive. Johnny.

968
01:36:21,266 --> 01:36:22,700
No.
Ro._ie i._ not alive.

969
01:36:23,399 --> 01:36:24,234
Ro._ie i._ _ea_.

970
01:36:24,333 --> 01:36:26,368
You are dead and
you have to stay dead!

971
01:36:26,466 --> 01:36:27,200
Got that?

972
01:36:27,266 --> 01:36:29,034
Now shut up and
Iet me think.

973
01:36:30,866 --> 01:36:32,567

974
01:36:33,699 --> 01:36:34,667
Stop cyino.

975
01:36:34,866 --> 01:36:36,867
Or l'll break the
other one too.

976
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,035
This is all your bloody fault.

977
01:36:40,233 --> 01:36:41,467
Hol_ thi._.

978
01:36:42,566 --> 01:36:44,134

01:36:46,366 --> 01:36:47,934
Why didn't you tell me?

980
01:36:48,233 --> 01:36:49,200
You coul_ have ._hown it to me.

981
01:36:49,233 --> 01:36:51,668
That damn photographer

982
01:36:52,066 --> 01:36:53,734
My mind ran wild..

983
01:36:54,066 --> 01:36:56,201
What was in it?
What the hell did he do to you?

984
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,468
You kille_ him..

985

Not me.

986
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,434
You think l couldn't digest
a thino like this.

987
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:06,702
l can never tell
what can oet you worked up.

988
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,435
You don't work like a clock
tick tock tick tock.

989
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:11,201
l am the one who's angy

Let's oo.

Actually, l didn't know
her that well.

1009
01:38:10,333 --> 01:38:12,368
l was vey young
when she ran away from home.

1010
01:38:12,433 --> 01:38:15,002
That'._ Ro._ie. Thi._ i._ me.

Would you write down your
address in Bombay?

You shouldnNgt have trained my
finoers to fiddle with a oun.

1023
01:39:07,633 --> 01:39:08,867
Stop the car.

1024

You've shown him my face,
You i_iot.

1028
01:39:28,933 --> 01:39:32,870
When you guys sta_ rattling off

01:39:33,166 --> 01:39:34,634
He has seen my face!

01:39:48,933 --> 01:39:51,435

01:41:43,133 --> 01:41:45,235
No one is indispensable.

l want this Johnny Balraj
out of this city.

1059
01:41:48,433 --> 01:41:51,369
Nowhere clo._e to me.

1060
01:41:51,433 --> 01:41:52,667
Januay 1st..

1061
01:41:52,933 --> 01:41:56,403
We lay the foundation
._tone of the World Trade Centre.

1062
01:41:56,899 --> 01:42:03,139
lf your boneheaded Johnny, messes
it up even a li'l bit..

1063
01:42:03,733 --> 01:42:05,734
if he ruins our plans..

1064
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:08,168
l will ruin you.

1065
01:42:08,233 --> 01:42:12,737
l will personally supe_ise
the end of you. Kaizad.

1066
01:42:13,066 --> 01:42:14,434
Who the hell is he,
anynray?

1067
01:42:14,666 --> 01:42:17,402
And why would you
Iet him keep the neoatives?

1068
01:42:17,666 --> 01:42:20,702
For God's sake!
We pay him for his se_ices.

1069
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:23,402
This bloody flunky
aspires to be a pa_ner!

1070
01:42:27,666 --> 01:42:31,002
l don't care
how you do it. Commissioner.

1071
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:34,703
But l want this
Johnny Balrai nuisance..

1072
01:42:35,133 --> 01:42:36,734
Out of the way.

1073
01:42:41,166 --> 01:42:42,066
What happened?

1074
01:42:42,233 --> 01:42:44,068
Your boss is here.
- Balrai?

1075
01:42:44,166 --> 01:42:46,568
He's too big a man
to be here.

1076
01:42:46,666 --> 01:42:48,000
lt'._ the Bo._._.

1077
01:42:53,033 --> 01:42:54,300
Chimman,
where are you from?

1078
01:42:54,733 --> 01:42:57,569
Where were you before
you moved to Bombay?

1079
01:42:58,699 --> 01:43:00,234
l come from Multan. Sir.

1080
01:43:00,866 --> 01:43:02,200
And Johnny?

1081
01:43:02,866 --> 01:43:04,167
Sialkot.

1082
01:43:05,733 --> 01:43:07,668
Why did you come
to Bombay?

1083
01:43:07,866 --> 01:43:09,434
Why not Delhi?

1084
01:43:09,833 --> 01:43:13,436
Trains enroute Delhi had
rioters killino eveyone.

1085
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:15,435
My folks sent me here
with some people.

1086
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:19,670
Muslims wanted their own county
._o we had to leave.

1087
01:43:26,333 --> 01:43:28,635
Pa_ition didn't happen..

1088
01:43:28,733 --> 01:43:31,802
because the Muslims wanted
their Paki._tan.

1089
01:43:31,833 --> 01:43:35,503
lt happened because Mr.Jinnah
wanted to rule.

1090
01:43:36,166 --> 01:43:38,001
lf India had remained
one nation...

1091
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,802
he would never have become
Pre._ident or Prime Mini._ter.

1092
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:44,802
He did what he did. for himself.

1093
01:43:45,066 --> 01:43:48,669
Evey man for himself.

1094
01:43:52,433 --> 01:43:54,268
Now Johnny wants to build.

1095
01:43:54,333 --> 01:43:56,601
Johnny Balrai Towers.

1096
01:43:56,666 --> 01:44:00,169
Not.. Johnny-Chimman Towers.

1097
01:44:03,166 --> 01:44:06,202
When l met the two of you..

1098
01:44:06,266 --> 01:44:07,900
you were friends.

1099
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,536
Today, he's the boss
and you're the flunky.

1100
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,034
What are you doing,
Chimman?

1101
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:15,600
Why are you in it?

1102
01:44:15,699 --> 01:44:17,435
Who are you doino it for?

1103
01:44:24,199 --> 01:44:27,603
Someday, l'm going to
bomb this Jap's head.

1104
01:44:29,899 --> 01:44:31,167
Hey pa_ner..

1105
01:44:31,366 --> 01:44:33,267
This isn't enough dough
even for half a meal.

1106
01:44:33,366 --> 01:44:34,934
l oave you what l oot.

1107
01:44:35,699 --> 01:44:37,868
Now. don't push it.

1108
01:44:39,766 --> 01:44:41,200
Listen to me. buddy.

1109
01:44:41,266 --> 01:44:44,202

01:44:45,466 --> 01:44:47,467
l oave you ten the other day.

1111
01:44:47,566 --> 01:44:49,301
Where did that go?
- Spent it.

1112
01:44:49,733 --> 01:44:51,801
My expenses have shot up...

1113
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:55,236
And fo_unately l know
my wo_h now.

1114
01:44:56,566 --> 01:44:57,533
You _rive?

1115
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,734
Of cour._e.

1116
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:02,168
l want to slouch in the
back ._eat.

1117
01:45:02,233 --> 01:45:05,235
l saw your pad buddy, you are rich
and l ._houldn't have known that.

1118
01:45:05,333 --> 01:45:06,400
That wasn't my pad.

1119
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:08,201
The dame was yours.

1120
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:11,869
You need big money
to keep a dame like that.

1121
01:45:12,733 --> 01:45:14,034
Look at thi._ car.

1122
01:45:14,133 --> 01:45:16,001
A baby like this...

1123
01:46:06,633 --> 01:46:08,167
Hano on.

1124
01:46:15,633 --> 01:46:17,334

You'll get me killed,

When will l see

01:46:50,433 --> 01:46:51,867
Never.

1136
01:46:52,066 --> 01:46:54,101
You're Rita.
You're not Ro._ie.

1137
01:46:54,666 --> 01:46:56,601
Let me mourn Rosie
for a month In style!

1138
01:46:57,766 --> 01:47:00,168
And then l will
romance Rita orandly.

1139
01:47:00,933 --> 01:47:02,134
The world will say..

1140
01:47:02,233 --> 01:47:03,300
Bio shot!

1141
01:47:05,966 --> 01:47:07,267
No.
- No?

1142
01:47:07,399 --> 01:47:08,701
They'll say: Look..

1143
01:47:09,466 --> 01:47:11,568
How much he loved
hi._ Ro._ie?

1144
01:47:11,966 --> 01:47:13,367
He even marrie_ her ._i._ter..

1145
01:47:13,466 --> 01:47:14,600
because he couldn't accept
her death.

1146
01:47:14,699 --> 01:47:16,601
Then we're oood.

1147
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:20,002
Our love stoy will be epic.

1148
01:47:20,066 --> 01:47:22,368
And life. a smash hit.

1149
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:23,734
Rita Ma_ame

1150
01:47:24,266 --> 01:47:27,102
You know Rosie ma'am

To tell you the truth, Rita ma'm..
l like you vey much.

Your ._mile..

For those infected,
nothino cures better than liauor.

1156
01:48:01,366 --> 01:48:08,339
When god isn't holy enough,
the love_s picture on the wall is.

1157
01:48:08,433 --> 01:48:12,003
Seems harmless. but is really lethal.

1158
01:48:12,100 --> 01:48:15,603
Seems harmless. but is really lethal.

1159
01:48:21,033 --> 01:48:24,936
Love is a deadly plaoue!

1160
01:48:27,033 --> 01:48:32,905
lf you're infected,
you're on your own!

1161
01:48:41,766 --> 01:48:43,033
Sir.

1162
01:48:44,166 --> 01:48:45,634

it's my hobby.

1166
01:48:54,733 --> 01:48:56,134
That's a oood hobby.

1167
01:48:59,433 --> 01:49:01,268
Did you have similar fights
with Ro._ie?

1168
01:49:02,466 --> 01:49:04,267
You fight with your wife,
don't you?

1169
01:49:04,566 --> 01:49:05,767
Of cour._e l _o.

1170

01:49:08,466 --> 01:49:10,534
l just keep shut.
Not a wor_ ._ai_.

1172
01:49:13,100 --> 01:49:15,101
How long have you been away
from home?

1173
01:49:19,433 --> 01:49:21,868
Let's cut the chase
l won't min_.

1174
01:49:21,933 --> 01:49:24,335
Why did you fight
with Ro._ie?

1175
01:49:25,266 --> 01:49:27,468
Do you know Jimmy Misty?

1176
01:49:28,233 --> 01:49:30,068
He recomen_e_ Ro._ie to me.

1177
01:49:30,133 --> 01:49:31,701
Said she's an amazino sinoer.

1178
01:49:31,933 --> 01:49:35,770
Then l found out
._he wa._ hi._ mole.

1179
01:49:35,866 --> 01:49:38,868
He wanted to dig out evey
detail on Mr. Khambatta.

1180
01:49:40,466 --> 01:49:43,902
Rosie was here as Jimm_s spy
for Khambatta..

1181
01:49:44,566 --> 01:49:46,701
So why fioht with Rosie?

1182
01:49:47,933 --> 01:49:49,034
Fir._t of all..

1183
01:49:49,666 --> 01:49:52,035
Mr. Khambatta's been like a
father to me.

1184
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:53,568
l respect him a lot.

1185
01:49:53,666 --> 01:49:55,067
An_ ._econ_ of all..

1186
01:49:55,133 --> 01:49:57,268
l love Rosie

Before she died,

01:50:11,033 --> 01:50:12,834
You ever fall ill?

1191
01:50:13,033 --> 01:50:14,367
l catch a cold once
in a while.

1192
01:50:14,433 --> 01:50:15,767
Get this gentleman's car.
- Not that..

1193
01:50:16,399 --> 01:50:18,268
Ever oet an itch in your privates?

1194
01:50:18,899 --> 01:50:19,867
What?

1195
01:50:19,933 --> 01:50:22,368
With the kind of relationship
you had with Rosie..

1196
01:50:22,399 --> 01:50:24,235
l thought you might have
contracte_ her _i._ea._e.

1197
01:50:24,766 --> 01:50:26,033
She ha_ Gonorrhoea.

1198
01:50:29,533 --> 01:50:32,102
Listen, Sir, it wasn't like that
between Ro._ie an_ me.

1199
01:50:32,966 --> 01:50:35,034
l loved her and it was pure.

1200
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:42,734
Good for you.

1201
01:51:05,699 --> 01:51:07,501
Where did you bump the car?

1202
01:51:07,699 --> 01:51:08,333
Car?

1203
01:51:08,399 --> 01:51:10,001
The bumpe_s ripped off.

1204
01:51:11,133 --> 01:51:14,336
Major was gettin' too big
for hi._ boot._.

1205
01:51:14,633 --> 01:51:16,501
Had to dump him in
the creek.

1206
01:51:17,333 --> 01:51:18,300
Want one?

1207
01:51:18,966 --> 01:51:20,334
And why was he getting
too bio for his boots?

1208
01:51:20,366 --> 01:51:23,168
Did he also know
you faked Rosie's death?

1209
01:51:24,133 --> 01:51:25,133
What crap?

1210
01:51:25,366 --> 01:51:27,034
l'm not a rookie anymore,
Balrai.

1211
01:51:27,133 --> 01:51:28,767
Rita is not Rita,
Rita i._ Ro._ie.

1212
01:51:29,033 --> 01:51:30,067
She'._ Ro._ie'._ ._i._ter.

1213
01:51:30,166 --> 01:51:31,467
Yeah. rioht.

1214
01:51:31,533 --> 01:51:33,268
With the ._ame face.

1215
01:51:33,333 --> 01:51:35,368
With the same mole in the same place
with the ._ame voice.

1216
01:51:35,399 --> 01:51:36,868
Twins are like that.
Look the ._ame.

1217
01:51:36,966 --> 01:51:39,501
Don't bullshit me Balraj.
Life is not Double Indemnity.

1218
01:51:40,166 --> 01:51:41,967
l've seen Rosie's
childhood pictures.

1219
01:51:42,266 --> 01:51:43,700
Her sister looks
nothino like her.

1220
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:45,368
lf someone tells you..

1221
01:51:45,399 --> 01:51:47,335
Kill Johnny..

1222
01:51:47,766 --> 01:51:48,867
Will you kill me?

1223
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,468
lf l get something
out of it.

1224
01:51:50,533 --> 01:51:51,800
Hey!
- Why not?

1225
01:51:51,866 --> 01:51:53,467
You tell me nothino.

1226
01:51:53,533 --> 01:51:55,301
What you do,
what you don't. nothino.

1227
01:51:55,366 --> 01:51:56,600
An_ what am l?

1228
01:51:56,666 --> 01:51:58,034
You're Khambatta's se_ant.
l'm yours.

1229
01:51:58,133 --> 01:51:59,334

Don't you see a difference?

1232
01:52:03,733 --> 01:52:05,901
You got into the car with Rosie
and off you went.

1233
01:52:05,966 --> 01:52:07,967
Ever cared to turn around

The ouard stands armed

1263
01:59:02,966 --> 01:59:05,268
He had to leave in a hury.
There was a problem.

1264

l ._ai_ l'll han_le it but..

1267
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:16,534
He said he'd write to you.

1268
01:59:17,833 --> 01:59:19,834
He should be back in a
year or so..

1269
01:59:34,533 --> 01:59:36,768
Take your money and
oet out.

1270
01:59:38,133 --> 01:59:41,302
Chimman has set me up for life.

You oet out.

01:59:44,333 --> 01:59:45,834
He's not oone away..

lt's iust that..

1274
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:53,534
He told me yesterday..

1275
01:59:56,933 --> 01:59:59,435
lf l _on't come back home..

1276
02:00:00,766 --> 02:00:02,067
Balrai will be here.

1277
02:00:05,133 --> 02:00:06,968
And if Balrai is here

1278
02:00:09,333 --> 02:00:11,134
Take your money and leave.

1279
02:00:12,533 --> 02:00:15,335
You owe him your life.

1280
02:00:16,533 --> 02:00:17,834
Leave!

1281
02:00:17,866 --> 02:00:21,669
A han_ful of fi._h

1282
02:00:22,133 --> 02:00:26,136
An ocean full of ._hark._

1283
02:00:26,233 --> 02:00:29,836
An_ that'._ the rule

1284
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:34,070
ln this market. that is life

1285
02:00:35,366 --> 02:00:36,767

Chimman'._ _ea_.

1287
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:44,602
Khambatta had sent him
to kill me.

1288
02:00:46,166 --> 02:00:47,267
But Chimman..

1289
02:00:49,300 --> 02:00:50,501
lt's all oone haynrire

1290
02:01:21,899 --> 02:01:27,472
But at the door,
the ouard stands armed.

1291
02:01:41,166 --> 02:01:41,900
Hello?

1292
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,534

Excu._e me.

1294
02:01:45,766 --> 02:01:48,935
lt means his lungs still
pump oyoen.

1295
02:01:50,766 --> 02:01:52,701
He eats. He pees.

1296
02:01:52,766 --> 02:01:53,733
He craps.

1297
02:01:54,033 --> 02:01:56,201
Take some soap and shampoo
if you want to meet him.

1298
02:01:56,666 --> 02:01:57,600
Who's speakino?

1299
02:01:58,399 --> 02:02:05,340
You're the kino of the streets

1300
02:02:05,399 --> 02:02:13,141
Streets is where you will remain

1301
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:22,040
They won't let you in the mansion

1302
02:02:22,133 --> 02:02:29,874
lt's meant for the privileoed only

1303
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:40,368
Comrade Deshpande..

1304
02:02:57,133 --> 02:02:58,801
Kaiza_..

1305
02:02:59,166 --> 02:03:01,868
l don't think l can trust
you anymore.

1306
02:03:02,166 --> 02:03:05,602
The Police, the Press
l'll han_le them all.

1307
02:03:05,633 --> 02:03:07,968
You iust take care of Johnny.

1308
02:03:08,333 --> 02:03:13,805
And yes, pray that Deshpande doesn't
reoain consciousness ever.

1309
02:03:16,766 --> 02:03:18,300
So who was the woman who
died in the explosion?

1310
02:03:18,399 --> 02:03:19,634
Some prostitute.

1311
02:03:19,899 --> 02:03:23,737
Her pimp Major was found
dead in the creek.

1312
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:26,135
He used to be in the Army.
Bomb expe_.

1313
02:03:27,800 --> 02:03:30,135
Chimman Chopra's house has been
Iocked up for days.

1314
02:03:30,233 --> 02:03:32,768
The neighbours said they saw
hi._ wife leave alone.

1315
02:03:33,066 --> 02:03:34,300
With some luooaoe.

1316
02:03:35,399 --> 02:03:37,635
Find Rosie.
You will find Johnny.

1317
02:03:38,333 --> 02:03:42,470
Rosie was put up at the YWCA but she's
been missino for the last 3 days.

1318
02:03:43,333 --> 02:03:44,534
l _on't care.

1319
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:46,535
Put his pictures in the papers..

1320
02:03:46,633 --> 02:03:48,101
Do whatever you have to do..

1321
02:03:48,566 --> 02:03:50,534
Frame him for kidnappino union leader.

1322
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:51,867
He's a fuoitive.

1323
02:03:53,033 --> 02:03:55,034
How lono will we be stuck here?

1324
02:03:55,633 --> 02:03:58,035
They got what they wanted
from you.

1325
02:03:58,633 --> 02:04:00,401
Now they want to kill you.

1326
02:04:00,466 --> 02:04:01,767
What's Tony doino' here?

1327
02:04:03,199 --> 02:04:07,237
Look, you can't run the club,
can't show your face anynrhere.

02:04:07,333 --> 02:04:08,367
Nor can l sino.

1329
02:04:08,466 --> 02:04:10,367
And the_re not going to
oive you your share either.

1330

How do l know what Ton_s up to?
He works for you. not me.

Are you even listening to me?

1336
02:04:25,333 --> 02:04:28,169
l worked my butt off for him
and now he won't pay?

1337
02:04:29,033 --> 02:04:31,535
He picked you off the streets and
made you the manaoer of Bombay Velvet.

1338
02:04:31,566 --> 02:04:33,000
That wasn't the payment?

1339
02:04:33,466 --> 02:04:35,167
l get to decide what
my wo_h is.

1340
02:04:35,566 --> 02:04:37,167
We ha_ a _eal..

1341
02:04:37,233 --> 02:04:38,601
But he reneoed on it.

1342
02:04:39,833 --> 02:04:40,800
lf he hadn't reneoed..

1343
02:04:40,866 --> 02:04:42,267
l wouldn't have
Chimman'._ death on me.

1344
02:04:45,666 --> 02:04:46,666
Look here.

1345
02:04:48,466 --> 02:04:49,466
Let it oo.

02:04:50,366 --> 02:04:52,000
How does it matter anymore?

1347
02:04:53,333 --> 02:04:55,034
You and me
Let's oet out of here.

1348
02:04:55,266 --> 02:04:56,467
We'll oet married.

1349
02:04:57,066 --> 02:05:00,836
And l will love you so much that no
Khambatta would ever matter.

1350
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:06,768
That's not possible. Rosie.

02:05:07,133 --> 02:05:10,302

You used to call me your
world-famous Rosie. rioht?

Scared to death,
._cared into ._ilence.

1355
02:05:19,766 --> 02:05:21,834
Only because l love you.

1356
02:05:23,133 --> 02:05:25,301
l gave up my dream of
sinoino for you.

1357
02:05:25,633 --> 02:05:27,668
Can't you let go of
Khambatta for me?

1358
02:05:27,766 --> 02:05:29,400
How _oe._ it matter?

1359

Give me two days.

1362

We've spent three days
Iookino for you. Miss Noronha.

1364
02:06:51,266 --> 02:06:53,368
He was called Maior Subedar.

1365
02:06:54,266 --> 02:06:57,068
He planted that bomb
in your house. Rosie.

1366
02:06:58,666 --> 02:07:00,234
On Johnn_s orders.

1367
02:07:05,333 --> 02:07:07,068
The corpse we found at
your house?

1368
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:09,401
Burnt from hea_ to toe.

1369
02:07:10,633 --> 02:07:12,668
She was Maior Subeda_s wife.

1370
02:07:12,833 --> 02:07:14,634
An entire family..

1371
02:07:15,766 --> 02:07:17,067
Wiped out.

1372
02:07:17,166 --> 02:07:19,067
Because of you. Rosie.

1373
02:07:27,766 --> 02:07:29,701
l'm not Rosie.
l'm Rita.

1374
02:07:30,533 --> 02:07:32,601
Rita goes to Rosie's home
for the fir._t time.

1375
02:07:32,666 --> 02:07:35,535
She does not react to anything,
except for this rino.

1376
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,869
Because it is the only thing
she doesn't recoonize.

1377
02:07:41,333 --> 02:07:44,302
Your home in Goa has been
Iocked up for years.

1378
02:07:46,266 --> 02:07:47,266
Because after your escape..

1379

the Po_uguese shot your
mother an_ ._i._ter.

1380

Do you know how many people
he ha._ kille_?

1382
02:07:59,366 --> 02:08:01,801
So why not catch those people
who ordered the killinos?

1383
02:08:02,199 --> 02:08:03,334

02:08:05,566 --> 02:08:07,100

Eve_hing's gonna change from
Januay 1st. Mr. Mayor.

1398
02:09:16,399 --> 02:09:19,369
Now the horse decides who

You want the Ministe_s neoatives?

1400
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:28,903

My name is Dharam Prakash

2
00:03:52,013 --> 00:03:55,278
You select any name but
l dont care

3
00:04:07,295 --> 00:04:10,321
l was waiting for this moment
since 4 years

4
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:17,459
So many crimes are registered
under his name

5
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:50,366
they think Prime minister Manmohan Singh
is the most dangerous things for country

6
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:54,236
its spread in more than 200
districts of this country

7
00:05:11,592 --> 00:05:14,493
its spread in so many states
of this country

8
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:17,497
thousands of people have
taken weapons

9
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:20,058
they are fighting against it

10
00:05:20,535 --> 00:05:27,907
they are getting weapons from
this country and from overseas

11
00:05:28,643 --> 00:05:34,138
there is no development here in 65 years
thats why there is so much crime here

12
00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:40,215
you are talking about vikas because
you want his land

13
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:56,994
until we use natural resources of this
land then how we can do development?

14
00:06:10,418 --> 00:06:19,122
as a chairman l want to guarantee you
civilians of nandi ghaat will get all requirements

15
00:06:29,203 --> 00:06:34,436
Mahanta group takes its responsibility
seriously

16
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,012
will there be seat available for
villagers in that university?

17
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:46,853
villagers dont want to leave that place,
will you force them to leave that place?

18
00:06:47,922 --> 00:06:53,326
when media is against development
then how truth will come infront of people?

19
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:12,474
l dont understand 1 thing

20
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,533
l just want to ask some basic questions

21
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:43,003
before you waste my time l want to clear 1 thing,
now l do only 3 works

22
00:07:48,616 --> 00:07:53,110
you can ask anything about them

23
00:07:55,056 --> 00:07:59,993
else l will not give any answer

24
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:13,630
if you want to behave like this then its ok,
l have a record you killed 91 police and 150 civilians

25
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,691

26
00:08:35,396 --> 00:08:37,762

31
00:09:27,815 --> 00:09:29,783

00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:51,937
how l tell what was kabir for me?

34
00:09:56,377 --> 00:09:59,210
he does not have anyone else
except me

35
00:10:01,982 --> 00:10:06,442
l was leaving in dreams.
l'm going back to government college

36
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,291
l dont want your father money

37
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:38,243
until now we have done everything
together

38
00:10:39,854 --> 00:10:44,257
stop drama and do sign on paper

39
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:49,522

l will make you police officer

40
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,999
you have to stand up.

what are you doing?

42
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:30,097
l told him many times do his own work.
dont involve in other's matters

43
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:46,810
l'm like this and l will
remain forever like this

44
00:11:47,488 --> 00:11:49,683
if you know about me then why
did you bring me here?

45
00:11:54,995 --> 00:11:56,895
dont show me your face again

46
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:10,004
l dont know where he was

47
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:50,244
l was doing some boring jobs then
l joined 1 electronics company

48
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:55,488
then l started my company to
make mobile phones

49
00:13:16,677 --> 00:13:22,172
1st consignment sold immediately

50
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:28,981
after 2 months l got complaints
and dealers stopped my payment

51
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:41,564
you beat police officer?

52
00:14:03,991 --> 00:14:05,515
how sure are you?

53
00:14:07,962 --> 00:14:10,692
they are planning for return attack

54
00:14:38,859 --> 00:14:42,090
rajan is here.
he is 400 degress far from target

55
00:14:50,104 --> 00:14:52,800
home minister is on the line

56
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,117
which group is behind it?

57
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:52,658
we are doing investigation.
who is behind it?

58
00:17:09,977 --> 00:17:13,037
l announce infront of whole world

59
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:32,492
we will never give our land

60
00:17:41,074 --> 00:17:45,704
but sir home minister gave permission

61
00:17:49,383 --> 00:17:54,047
did l allow you to send officers?

62
00:17:59,026 --> 00:18:02,484
dont put your tension on me

63
00:18:05,232 --> 00:18:12,695
just now prashant mahanta has called
media

64
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:25,850
until government takes the safety responsibility
of all workers we cannot do any work

65
00:18:38,398 --> 00:18:40,662
show some action DGP sir

66
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:53,507
emotions will be disturbed
by losing our soldiers

67
00:19:01,121 --> 00:19:05,581
l know adi but these politicians
have different compulsions

68
00:19:06,326 --> 00:19:10,422
they put pressure on us

69
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:26,736
timing is not good.
who wants to go nandi ghaat?

70
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:38,657
l dont understand how 84 police
officer died in 1 night?

71
00:19:39,459 --> 00:19:43,327
and how terrorists are ruling
in nandi ghaat?

72
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:06,515
you are going to do
this madness

73
00:20:07,354 --> 00:20:13,418
we got togetherjob after so much hard wor.
just now we decided to start a new life

74
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:12,377
police officers come at their
own risk

75
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:28,197
around 4 to 5 kms

76
00:22:31,298 --> 00:22:34,131
why gate is shut?

77
00:22:37,103 --> 00:22:41,472
key is with sir.
tell him SP sir has come

78
00:23:02,996 --> 00:23:06,591
another police station is 23 kms
far from this place

79
00:23:12,672 --> 00:23:17,473
when we make police station,
terrorists blast it with dynamite

80
00:23:19,012 --> 00:23:22,675
how you get all the information?

81
00:23:30,724 --> 00:23:33,989
they settle all the matters in
their own court

82
00:24:06,192 --> 00:24:09,821
stop this drama

83
00:24:24,311 --> 00:24:31,843
they make billions and when we ask
for 20 millions then they are angry

84
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:59,730
they buy weapons and arms
from this money

85
00:26:03,443 --> 00:26:08,745
l can arrest you

86
00:26:13,987 --> 00:26:17,514
sorry but even police dont reply
us for our protection

87
00:26:18,024 --> 00:26:21,323
millions lose.
what is the solution?

88
00:26:36,743 --> 00:26:39,007
but you also have to help us

89
00:26:46,853 --> 00:26:49,651
we have to fight together

90
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,950
our younsters dont understand politics

91
00:26:53,426 --> 00:26:57,419
they dont understand why we are
fighting with our own people?

92
00:26:58,765 --> 00:27:03,429
they think our politicians dont want
solution

93
00:27:05,505 --> 00:27:11,341
if our soldiers saved from terrorists
then they will die from malaria

94
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,444
they cannot talk to their family

95
00:27:22,088 --> 00:27:26,047
if he is strong then KK and saranjeet
would not be trapped

96
00:27:26,926 --> 00:27:31,386
they have full support of villagers

97
00:27:36,469 --> 00:27:41,463
they are among villagers thats why
its difficult to recognize them

98
00:27:42,242 --> 00:27:46,576
there network is so strong that
they get all our news

99
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:31,015
they are afraid of police man
more than death

100
00:30:25,104 --> 00:30:26,696
your friend

101
00:30:27,407 --> 00:30:30,376
l accept we made a mistake

102
00:30:31,477 --> 00:30:35,174
government did not concentrate on you

103
00:30:35,782 --> 00:30:40,151
you are afraid of police man

104
00:30:41,988 --> 00:30:45,981
if you support us then we can
correct our mistake

105
00:30:46,993 --> 00:30:50,656
this country wants you to be
a part of it

106
00:30:56,369 --> 00:31:03,241
just think what they have done for you?

107
00:31:08,314 --> 00:31:12,774
did they give you all this?
can they give all this?

108
00:31:31,938 --> 00:31:35,897
this war should end

109
00:31:36,876 --> 00:31:42,610
leave this coward life and support us.
we can make a good society

110
00:31:51,724 --> 00:32:00,860
if you have any problem.
no matter who they are

112
00:32:38,538 --> 00:32:41,405
they cheat you

113
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:44,974
they do buttering and then cheat you

114
00:32:51,951 --> 00:32:55,011
this is a police of cheat government

115
00:33:19,112 --> 00:33:21,137
from where all this money comes?

116
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:37,389
they made a contract of
15000 crores

117
00:33:55,781 --> 00:33:58,875
they will open international
university

118
00:34:00,052 --> 00:34:04,853
where our children will speak
and learn english

119
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:14,857

120
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:55,733

00:59:32,283 --> 00:59:35,480
he also listened police
talk on radio

172
01:00:09,854 --> 01:00:12,618
from where you learned all this?

173
01:00:50,561 --> 01:00:54,622
you are great.
you dont know counting after 20

174
01:01:05,042 --> 01:01:09,001
dont take him lightly

175
01:01:10,181 --> 01:01:15,278
they have hired a senior officer

176
01:01:23,361 --> 01:01:26,330
they have hired private soldiers

177
01:01:37,241 --> 01:01:42,736
we will give weapons training to
senate and congress

178
01:02:12,577 --> 01:02:15,375
l do collection and you do accounts

179
01:02:20,484 --> 01:02:23,681
whatever l do collection l
give it to you

180
01:02:43,507 --> 01:02:48,069
control yourself

181
01:03:09,233 --> 01:03:13,465
tell suppliers to give weapons on time

182
01:04:40,091 --> 01:04:42,355
why they are leaving us here?

183
01:05:58,469 --> 01:06:01,495
i'm a bit late.
i will be there in 15 mins

184
01:06:10,614 --> 01:06:17,850
every person has so many names here.
juhi is your real name?

185
01:06:40,778 --> 01:06:45,909
my father wanted me to study.
but something else was written in my destiny

186
01:06:52,923 --> 01:06:59,487
first he kidnapped my 2 brothers
and then he took over our land

187
01:07:17,314 --> 01:07:21,876
i want to make my government

188
01:07:24,088 --> 01:07:27,888
if i will live for 10 more years
then i will kill 100 more people

189
01:08:34,692 --> 01:08:38,594
i thought you are busy in singing

190
01:08:48,872 --> 01:08:52,706
after giving me location then
break your phone

191
01:10:24,068 --> 01:10:25,660
police raid this place

192
01:10:34,078 --> 01:10:37,172
everyone arrested

193
01:11:20,991 --> 01:11:24,188
they had a plan to distribute guns
to villagers

194
01:11:25,929 --> 01:11:29,956
but our intelligence is keeping
their eye on them

195
01:11:38,542 --> 01:11:43,536
no matter what adi do.
even death cannot shake us

196
01:11:47,918 --> 01:11:50,182
this is for civilians

197
01:11:55,426 --> 01:12:03,231
until we kill them all we will
not sit quiet

198
01:17:46,209 --> 01:17:51,374
we have smashed their trainign camp

199
01:17:52,215 --> 01:17:56,447
whole credit goes to adil khan

200
01:17:58,488 --> 01:18:06,088
are you sure 64 people killed are
not innocent?

201
01:18:10,167 --> 01:18:14,263
when police do human rights violent
then why there is no enquiry?

202
01:18:25,415 --> 01:18:28,111
these terrorists dont believe
on any rule

203
01:18:33,957 --> 01:18:37,654
police man died because they
were securing their country

204
01:19:01,785 --> 01:19:04,845
why you did not give warning?
why you did firing?

205
01:19:06,056 --> 01:19:09,685
we gave warning but they were
busy in singing

206
01:19:13,396 --> 01:19:18,698
it was no good. so many innocent
people died

207
01:19:21,671 --> 01:19:26,574
they think government never do anything
for them now they will take there home

208
01:19:30,413 --> 01:19:36,318
l trust you otherwise l would not
allow you to go inside

209
01:19:37,087 --> 01:19:44,323
you are getting confused from there
propaganda and if you want leave this mission

210
01:19:51,468 --> 01:19:53,527
l have taken this mission
to help you

211
01:20:02,979 --> 01:20:06,847
l know you are hurt by looking at them

212
01:20:13,356 --> 01:20:18,225
this place will become hell

213
01:20:22,599 --> 01:20:25,591
what we are doing,
people will get benefit from it

214
01:20:31,274 --> 01:20:34,539
when l get rajan,
you run from there

215
01:21:21,825 --> 01:21:26,558
you have done a solid work for us,
we should also do something for you

216
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:32,031
we thought to send seeta mother to you

217
01:21:38,575 --> 01:21:41,339
we are sending riya memon as
a director here

218
01:21:43,246 --> 01:21:48,980
your president cannot stop
gold medal this time

219
01:22:28,591 --> 01:22:30,616
then country will move further

220
01:22:59,889 --> 01:23:02,653
whatever happened it was not
your mistake

221
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:42,723
rajan is looking so weak

222
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:48,194
you are also human being

223
01:24:01,384 --> 01:24:07,687
money is also a part of game

224
01:24:08,625 --> 01:24:15,292
and adil khan knows this better.
i have seen his record

225
01:24:17,467 --> 01:24:22,632
now you have to think how to
kill his confidence

226
01:24:31,247 --> 01:24:35,547
govind has 1 7 different cases registered
on his name

227
01:24:36,286 --> 01:24:43,988
why dont you transfer all cases to 1 place?

228
01:24:54,304 --> 01:24:57,296
thats why l dont want to leave you behind

229
01:24:58,007 --> 01:25:02,171
we have to accomplish this mission

230
01:25:02,946 --> 01:25:06,905
we will kill enemy by entering
in his own house

231
01:25:24,267 --> 01:25:27,725

235
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:08,087

your power

244
01:31:11,547 --> 01:31:14,846

245
01:31:18,354 --> 01:31:20,914

on our project lands

248
01:31:41,777 --> 01:31:48,444
you need to talk to collector and
revenur department to empty this place

249
01:31:55,825 --> 01:32:03,755
we do work for legal work only

250
01:32:19,849 --> 01:32:24,684
they are arranging arms on
emergency basis

251
01:32:25,521 --> 01:32:31,949
people who got notice to empty the place,
we will go there and talk to them

252
01:32:33,496 --> 01:32:36,397

01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:12,697
we miss him

254
01:33:15,137 --> 01:33:23,408
but we have to move forward his work.
you have to take his responsibility

255
01:33:39,195 --> 01:33:41,459

256
01:33:46,969 --> 01:33:49,369
we have to empty 230 villages fast

257
01:33:51,006 --> 01:33:56,911
after supreme court orders
it does not work

258
01:34:02,885 --> 01:34:03,681
we love to talk directly

259
01:34:12,461 --> 01:34:17,364

260
01:34:20,002 --> 01:34:23,665

263
01:36:59,261 --> 01:37:02,697
they were doing work with guns

264
01:37:09,371 --> 01:37:15,071
you look at terrorists,
they will look at villages

265
01:37:15,878 --> 01:37:21,839
they are angry on governement.
we will lose our newly made goodwill

266
01:37:25,354 --> 01:37:30,018

who breaks law

267
01:37:43,038 --> 01:37:48,169

supervise

268
01:38:12,434 --> 01:38:18,270
adil khan is doing with planning to
make us weak

269
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:22,637
we have to defend ourselves

270
01:38:23,512 --> 01:38:31,044
whatever we have, we have to
arrange food for them

271
01:38:38,327 --> 01:38:42,161

if he will not return then no
investor will return here

nothing will happen to aditya if
you agree on our condition

331
02:04:06,687 --> 02:04:08,211
police will agree on it?

332

333
02:04:36,483 --> 02:04:39,680

336
02:09:28,175 --> 02:09:33,636
is it true adil khan is your friend
and he sent you here?

337
02:09:42,890 --> 02:09:53,528
you are saying this monster is
a police officer?

338
02:10:04,912 --> 02:10:07,745
only 1 reason to show
this reality

339
02:10:11,785 --> 02:10:16,586
kabir was my best friend.
he will anything if he decided

340
02:10:29,770 --> 02:10:38,439
because of your act many soldiers
and innocent people died

341
02:10:41,915 --> 02:10:44,509
i did not know police will
fire on training camp

342
02:10:53,293 --> 02:10:54,590
we gave you place and
trusted you

343
02:10:56,263 --> 02:11:01,257

344
02:11:08,909 --> 02:11:14,313
when i came to know who and your
problems l changed my decision

345
02:11:17,017 --> 02:11:21,852
thats why we gave this news to press
to break us

346
02:11:28,061 --> 02:11:32,464
we kidnapped his son and free rajan
thats why he is taking revenge

347
02:13:43,864 --> 02:13:46,560

348
02:14:28,008 --> 02:14:34,208
this chip was telling adil where are you

349
02:14:37,584 --> 02:14:41,111
you and rajan must be alive

350
02:14:41,855 --> 02:14:45,347

combats will born

351
02:18:36,289 --> 02:18:38,154
why you have done this?

352
02:18:39,426 --> 02:18:43,419
it was my mistake to allow
you to go inside

thousands of people are fighting

358
02:21:19,686 --> 02:21:23,213
why we are not getting exit
of this problem?

359
02:21:24,157 --> 02:21:32,462
in 65 years of independence we got development,
but most of population left behind

360
02:21:33,533 --> 02:21:40,962
reality of india is that 25% population is rich
and 75% can earn Rs 20 per day

00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:57,724
Thinking now there
wiII be an accident.

69
00:06:58,094 --> 00:06:59,391
Now there wiII be an accident.

70
00:06:59,562 --> 00:07:01,029
Not even a singIe car.

71
00:07:01,063 --> 00:07:02,621
DisgracefuI.

72
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,390
Hey, brother.

73
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:08,400
Hey, brother. Bang

Hey, brother..

If you act so badIy peopIe

Yes, no car wiII meet
with an accident here..

80
00:07:27,757 --> 00:07:30,487
..because we are.. very unfortunate.

81
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,419
Now, there's just one way Ieft.
- What way?

82
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,732
The devious way.

83
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:45,568
Adi, what are we doing at this bar?

84
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:51,772
Oh, we are going to
cook omeIet and seII them.

00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:55,749
No omeIet, we are going
to knockout peopIe. Roy.

00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:57,308
Of course!

88
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:18,467
Can I sit?

89
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:31,175
What are you going
to do with this egg?

90
00:08:31,253 --> 00:08:35,349
Mister, if you can keep
this egg in your mouth..

Then give me the egg.

96

He has done an amazing thing.

97
00:08:58,314 --> 00:09:01,477
Forget about the egg and
chicken you have been fooIed, Tony.

98
00:09:05,187 --> 00:09:06,381
Why you..

Look, everyone recognizes me now.

00:10:56,198 --> 00:11:01,261

00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:05,402
Can you do it?
- I can do anything?

131
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:08,068
Fine, first you do it.

Break the egg.

136
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,648
Break the egg.

137
00:11:24,527 --> 00:11:26,222
Break the egg.

138
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:30,461
Break the egg.

139
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:38,134
Break the egg. - Great.

140
00:11:38,207 --> 00:11:39,731
Save me.

141
00:11:41,343 --> 00:11:43,334
Adi. Okay.

142
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,112
Adi.

143
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:50,745
Hit him, hit him, oh shit!

144
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,312
You can't hit me.

145
00:11:58,127 --> 00:11:59,594
Oh no.

146
00:12:12,308 --> 00:12:14,367
There they are. Beat them.

147
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,456
Enough. Enough.

148
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:41,565
No one ever beat us up so badIy.

149
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:45,266
Adi, be thankfuI that at
Ieast they didn't rape us.

150
00:12:45,341 --> 00:12:47,775
Our fate has raped us.

151
00:12:48,177 --> 00:12:49,804
If we had money..

152
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,779
..then we wouId've
had so many things.

153
00:12:51,847 --> 00:12:55,510
Yes, car, bungaIow,
bank baIance and ma..

154
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:57,710
Mother.
- Quiet.

155
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,879
Mercedes Benz.

156
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:01,718
Yes, Mercedes.

157
00:13:02,091 --> 00:13:03,319
Like the one Kabir's sitting in.

158
00:13:03,392 --> 00:13:05,360
Kabir.
- Kabir.

159
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,695
Kabir.
- Kabir.

160
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:12,097
Where did that miserabIe
guy get so much money from?

161
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:15,235
Even he donated his money.

162
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:24,201
Run. Run, run, foIIow him!

163
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:48,861
Such a big car.

164
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:51,136
Such a big office.

165
00:13:51,307 --> 00:13:54,799
How did Kabir become so rich?

166
00:13:54,877 --> 00:14:00,213
LoyaIty, honesty,
dedication and responsibiIity.

167
00:14:00,816 --> 00:14:06,379
Today Kabir Naik is rich
because of these four quaIities.

168
00:14:07,656 --> 00:14:11,285
And I have seen these four
quaIities in the four of you.

Thank you.

170
00:14:12,628 --> 00:14:16,086
And that is why the
four of you are here.

171
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,389
Sir has appointed you
the chief executive..

172
00:14:18,434 --> 00:14:22,063

Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

174
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,536
That's nothing.

175
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,335
Sir is giving you furnished
apartments aIong with fixed saIaries.

176
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:32,608
And yes, everyone wiII
have a personaI car as weII.

177
00:14:32,681 --> 00:14:34,410
CongratuIations.

178
00:14:35,317 --> 00:14:36,443
Thank you.

179
00:14:36,518 --> 00:14:40,352
Sir, how do we thank you?
- Just Iike you do.

180
00:14:41,623 --> 00:14:45,684
Look, if the four of
you keep working hard..

181
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:48,789
..then one day I wiII make
you partners in this company.

182
00:14:48,864 --> 00:14:50,161
Partners.

183
00:14:50,232 --> 00:14:51,392
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

184
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,196
It's okay.

185
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,599
Okay. Okay. Come on.

186
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,262
It's okay.

187
00:15:01,643 --> 00:15:03,804
Instead of us four taIented peopIe..

188
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,377
..he's making these
four fooIs his partner.

189
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:09,383
It shouId have been
us in their pIace.

190
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,611
If we become the partners..

191
00:15:10,686 --> 00:15:13,553
..then we wiII have car, bungaIow,
bank baIance.

192
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:16,557
But how wiII we become partners?

193
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,150
EmotionaI..
- Torture.

194
00:15:19,228 --> 00:15:20,695
Yes, Iet's go.

195
00:15:20,763 --> 00:15:21,821
Adi.

196
00:15:22,097 --> 00:15:24,759
Adi, no. Adi, no. Not this way, Adi.

197
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,290
Not this way.

198
00:15:35,577 --> 00:15:37,169
Napkin, sir. Napkin.

199
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,217
Troy.

200
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:54,685
Roy.
- Wipe, you rascaIs, wipe.

201
00:15:57,866 --> 00:16:00,630
Chaman.
- Boman.

202
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:02,636
Kabadi.
- Adi.

203
00:16:02,704 --> 00:16:04,296
Tandav.
- Manav.

204
00:16:04,373 --> 00:16:06,102
Yes, yes.

205
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:08,242
How are aII of you?

206
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:12,509
What are you doing here?
- CIeaning the toiIets.

207
00:16:12,581 --> 00:16:14,549
What?
- Shocked, aren't you?

208
00:16:15,084 --> 00:16:17,552
That why
inteIIigent peopIe Iike us..

209
00:16:17,619 --> 00:16:20,349
..are doing such a backward job.

210
00:16:20,756 --> 00:16:22,656
Have courage, Roy, have courage.

211
00:16:22,724 --> 00:16:24,419
We wiII be successfuI.

212
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,825
There's hope in our hearts.

213
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:27,562
No matter how much it stinks.

214
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:31,087
Cotton.. just Iike there's
cotton stashed in the piIIow..

215
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,100
..there are four things
stashed in us as weII.

216
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:35,329
No, no, no, we are born with it.

217
00:16:35,404 --> 00:16:38,373
Like.. IoyaIty.
- Honesty.

218
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,840
Dedication.
- Deceit.

219
00:16:41,577 --> 00:16:44,068
No, no, not deceit. ResponsibiIity.

220
00:16:44,113 --> 00:16:45,444
Just a minute.

221
00:16:45,514 --> 00:16:47,846
That's what I said.
- And we heard it.

222
00:16:48,117 --> 00:16:51,518
Outside the window, covertIy.
- QuietIy.

223
00:16:52,154 --> 00:16:54,179
You eavesdropped
on my conversation..

224
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:55,518
..and now are
putting up a charade here.

225
00:16:55,591 --> 00:16:58,253
It's not a drama but
emotionaI torture.

226
00:16:58,327 --> 00:17:00,454
So that you can forget
about those four fooIs..

227
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:03,192
..and make us your partners.

228
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:06,599
Make your four partners.
- Yes.

229
00:17:06,668 --> 00:17:08,363
Good idea. - Thank you.

230
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:13,302
If I even appoint
you watchmen here..

231
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:16,237
..it wiII be insuIting to them.

232
00:17:16,378 --> 00:17:18,175
FooIs.

233
00:17:22,284 --> 00:17:25,481
He humiIiated us so badIy.

234
00:17:25,721 --> 00:17:27,154
Now no matter what happens..

235
00:17:27,222 --> 00:17:29,349
..but we wiII be your partners,
Kabir. - Yes.

236
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:32,518
Otherwise I am the
son of two fathers.

237
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:35,290
And I am the son of three father

238
00:17:35,364 --> 00:17:38,265
I am the son of four fathers.

239
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:41,564
I am the son of the entire India.

240
00:17:49,845 --> 00:17:51,437
There's no one in the office.

241
00:17:51,513 --> 00:17:53,674
Seems Iike Kabir caIIed us first.

242
00:17:53,749 --> 00:17:56,445
He ought to, after aII we are VIP's.

243
00:17:56,518 --> 00:17:57,576
Very important person.

244
00:17:57,653 --> 00:17:59,621
Now we'II have money,
position, power.

245
00:17:59,688 --> 00:18:03,351
Now everyone wiII saIute
us and say.. - ScoundreIs!

246
00:18:03,692 --> 00:18:04,750
RascaIs.

247
00:18:05,494 --> 00:18:06,620
You wiII be punished.

248
00:18:06,695 --> 00:18:09,459
EquaIIy.
- Much more than that.

249
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,064
No.

250
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:17,535
You rascaIs, scoundreIs, fooI,
stupid, morons..

251
00:18:18,774 --> 00:18:20,071
I hadn't sIapped you.

252
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:24,602
You gave a 100 crores
estimate to Kabir sir on month end.

253
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:31,779
Yes. - But the profit
was just 99,99,99,000.

254
00:18:32,054 --> 00:18:34,113
That means there was a
Ioss of 1000 rupees.

255
00:18:34,189 --> 00:18:36,157
You.. you deserve one more sIap.

256
00:18:36,225 --> 00:18:37,283
SIap.
- SIap.

257
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,055
Take them away.
- Okay, boss.

258
00:18:40,362 --> 00:18:42,091
Come on.
- Okay, okay.

259
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:45,431
No, no, no.

260
00:18:45,701 --> 00:18:49,068
Such severe torture
for just 1000 rupees.

261
00:18:49,104 --> 00:18:56,135
Kabir sir has appointed
four new peopIe in your pIace.

262
00:18:56,211 --> 00:19:01,547
That means us.
- That's why you are fired.

263
00:19:01,617 --> 00:19:02,675
Fired!

264
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:05,379
And Kabir sir doesn't just say fire.

265
00:19:05,454 --> 00:19:08,252
Then?
- He fires with his gun.

266
00:19:08,557 --> 00:19:10,218
Give me the gun.

267
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:11,452
You are dirty.

268
00:19:12,094 --> 00:19:14,085
Give me the gun! Gun!

269
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,554
Okay, boss.

270
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:19,767
Where is he taking it out from?

271
00:19:20,168 --> 00:19:21,226
Gun.

272
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,135
JaIIad.
- Yes, boss.

273
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,230
CIose the door.
- Okay, boss.

274
00:19:25,307 --> 00:19:26,672
Don't kiII us.
- No.

275
00:19:26,742 --> 00:19:28,801
Don't shoot us.

276
00:19:38,687 --> 00:19:41,588
Murder. Murder.

277
00:19:47,296 --> 00:19:48,490
Run away.

278
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:52,226
You won't get anything
here except for death.

279
00:19:52,301 --> 00:19:54,394
Run, Arjun, run!

280
00:19:55,537 --> 00:19:57,402
Run!

281
00:19:57,472 --> 00:19:59,440
Just a minute.

282
00:19:59,508 --> 00:20:00,600
Kabir sir.

283
00:20:00,676 --> 00:20:02,234
Look, he is here to kiII us.

284
00:20:02,277 --> 00:20:04,472
Let us go, pIease.

285
00:20:04,546 --> 00:20:06,810
I won't Iet you go Iike this.

286
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:09,175
See, he wiII kiII us.

287
00:20:09,318 --> 00:20:12,116
I wiII kiII you?
- See, he is teIIing us.

288
00:20:12,187 --> 00:20:14,451
''I wiII kiII you.''
- Shut up, you idiots.

289
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:15,683
Otherwise I wiII fire you guys.

290
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,725
See he wiII fire at us.

291
00:20:27,402 --> 00:20:28,767
So this is your doing.

292
00:20:28,837 --> 00:20:30,304
Yes.
- ObviousIy.

293
00:20:30,372 --> 00:20:33,341
And untiI you keep
caIIing such idiots..

294
00:20:33,408 --> 00:20:35,774
..we wiII keep driving them away.

295
00:20:36,178 --> 00:20:40,615
UntiI you don't
make us your partners.

296
00:20:40,682 --> 00:20:42,149
Understand.
- Partners.

297
00:20:42,217 --> 00:20:43,844
No.
- No. No vioIence.

298
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,711
Kabir. - PIease.

299
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:53,789
Nice.

300
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,824
DarIing, what's going on?

301
00:20:55,897 --> 00:20:57,296
Is everything aIright?

302
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,124
Who is she?

303
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:03,495
She is our madam. Kabir sir's wife.

304
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:05,263
Wife?
- Yes.

305
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,773
She's his wife.

306
00:21:07,342 --> 00:21:11,403
Sister-in-Iaw!
- Sister-in-Iaw!

307
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,108
Who.. who are they, Kabir?
- Kabir?

308
00:21:14,182 --> 00:21:17,276
Not, Kabir. Ram, and you are Sita.

309
00:21:17,352 --> 00:21:19,411
And we are Ram's younger brothers.

310
00:21:19,621 --> 00:21:21,316
So sweet.
- Thank you.

311
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,858
Just a minute. Ram onIy
had three younger brothers.

312
00:21:24,126 --> 00:21:25,388
ReaIIy?

313
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,451
That's okay.
Consider yourseIf Draupadi..

314
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:30,464
..and us, four pIus one,
five Pandavas.

315
00:21:33,702 --> 00:21:35,829
DarIing, you go on, I wiII join you.

316
00:21:36,104 --> 00:21:37,196
Okay, darIing, bye.

317
00:21:37,272 --> 00:21:38,796
Bye.
- Bye.

318
00:21:39,207 --> 00:21:41,801
The four of you managed
to barge inside my office.

319
00:21:41,877 --> 00:21:45,244
But if you try to
barge in my bungaIow..

320
00:21:45,447 --> 00:21:47,779
..then I wiII punch your face in.

321
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:51,213
He's very short-tempered.

322
00:21:51,753 --> 00:21:56,781
Kabir, not just your bungaIow but
we wiII foIIow you even to heII.

323
00:21:57,526 --> 00:22:00,120
Come on, foIIow him.

324
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,463
Enough is enough, Kabir.

325
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,166
There's a Iimit to everything.

326
00:22:12,307 --> 00:22:13,740
I don't want to
discuss this any more.

327
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:15,071
You understand.

328
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,738
Did you understand anything?
- No. I mean yes.

329
00:22:17,813 --> 00:22:22,307
But, I need some money..
- I said no means no, Kabir.

330
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,716
I give you money every month for
the monthIy expenses, isn't it?

331
00:22:24,753 --> 00:22:25,845
Not a singIe penny more.

332
00:22:26,121 --> 00:22:29,784
If I couId get 500,000..
- You won't get five rupees.

333
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:33,387
DarIing, juice.

334
00:22:35,197 --> 00:22:37,290
He turned out to be a
poor beggar just Iike us.

335
00:22:37,365 --> 00:22:38,457
Bye. Bye. - Bye.

336
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:40,660
He's a beggar and she's poor.

337
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:43,135
He is Iiving off his wife.

338
00:22:53,448 --> 00:22:57,578
36.
- 24. - 36.

339
00:22:57,652 --> 00:22:59,176
Seven.

340
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:02,583
Shoe size. Shoe size.

341
00:23:02,691 --> 00:23:05,057
You are Iooking at her
shoe size, aren't you ashamed?

342
00:23:05,126 --> 00:23:06,821
She is Iike our sister-in-Iaw.

343
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:08,820
What a sister-in-Iaw.

344
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,155
Honey, Iisten to me.

345
00:23:10,232 --> 00:23:11,665
Kabir, why don't you understand?

346
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:13,462
I don't want to have
this discussion any more.

347
00:23:13,535 --> 00:23:16,231
The discussion is over.

348
00:23:16,304 --> 00:23:18,204
I am going for a shower.

349
00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:28,483
HeIIo, GuIabo.
- GuIabo.

350
00:23:30,385 --> 00:23:33,513
My, sugar honey, sugar pie,
sugar doII, sugar bag.

351
00:23:33,588 --> 00:23:35,818
That scoundreI is having an affair.

352
00:23:36,091 --> 00:23:37,422
That too so sweet.

353
00:23:37,492 --> 00:23:41,155
He wiII die of diabetes.

354
00:23:41,229 --> 00:23:42,856
Idea. Listen.

355
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:54,101
My wife must have been
born after 1000 foxes died.

356
00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:57,810
I am toIerating my wife for money.

357
00:23:57,879 --> 00:24:00,109
Otherwise I wouId
have Ieft her Iong back.

358
00:24:02,117 --> 00:24:03,812
I wiII adjust it in the accounts..

359
00:24:04,085 --> 00:24:06,280
..and get your set by tomorrow.

360
00:24:06,354 --> 00:24:09,414
And after that
Iights off, Jacuzzi on.

361
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:12,551
And have some fun in the Jacuzzi.

362
00:24:16,598 --> 00:24:21,535
Kabir and guIabo wiII be together.

363
00:24:26,408 --> 00:24:27,807
Where is my other phone?

364
00:24:28,143 --> 00:24:29,667
Kabir.

365
00:24:32,314 --> 00:24:36,546
Your mobiIe is right here.

366
00:24:37,285 --> 00:24:38,547
You here.

367
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,281
How did aII of you come here?

368
00:24:40,488 --> 00:24:44,652
And my mobiIe.
- And this mobiIe has an MMS cIip..

369
00:24:44,726 --> 00:24:49,754
..which has Kabir and
GuIabo's conversation.

370
00:24:50,231 --> 00:24:51,357
Yes.

371
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:56,829
'My wife must have been
born after 1000 foxes died.'

372
00:24:57,305 --> 00:25:01,105
'I am toIerating my wife for money.'

373
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:08,807
'Kabir and guIabo
wiII be together '.

374
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:17,385
Adi, what if
sister-in-Iaw sees this cIip?

375
00:25:17,692 --> 00:25:23,153
He wiII be in troubIe.
- Shut up.

376
00:25:24,199 --> 00:25:28,101
You are trying to bIackmaiI me.
- No.

377
00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:30,364
We aren't trying we are doing it.

378
00:25:30,605 --> 00:25:32,334
Quiet!

379
00:25:33,341 --> 00:25:37,368
You think I wiII be scared of you.
- No.

380
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:39,675
We are sure you wiII be scared.

381
00:25:41,716 --> 00:25:45,083
If you don't make us your partner..

382
00:25:45,153 --> 00:25:53,151
..then we wiII send this MMS
cIip on sister-in-Iaw's mobiIe.

383
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:55,259
Kabir.

384
00:25:56,398 --> 00:25:58,457
The button wiII get pressed.

385
00:25:58,533 --> 00:26:02,594
The button wiII get pressed.

386
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,441
Kabir.

387
00:26:12,514 --> 00:26:15,506
Why am I hiding? You hide.

388
00:26:16,685 --> 00:26:20,177
Kabir, what have you sent?

389
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:27,319
What a superb joke you
have messaged me? - Joke?

390
00:26:27,395 --> 00:26:30,831
Yes. Husbands and the
sun are so unfaithfuI.

391
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:32,760
They come with
'Kiran' (Ray of Iight).

392
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:34,462
Stay with 'Roshini' (Iight).

393
00:26:34,536 --> 00:26:36,629
And Ieave with 'Sandhya' (evening).

394
00:26:36,671 --> 00:26:40,300
This better be a joke, Kabir.
- Of course, darIing.

395
00:26:46,748 --> 00:26:48,648
If you don't make us your partner..

396
00:26:48,717 --> 00:26:53,416
..then we wiII make a joke out
of you in front of your wife.

397
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:56,651
Yes. - This isn't how
one becomes partners.

398
00:26:56,858 --> 00:27:01,022
One has to come to the office
and work to become partners.

399
00:27:01,229 --> 00:27:05,290
We wiII sureIy come to the
office but you wiII do the work.

400
00:27:05,366 --> 00:27:08,164
And these goggIes are reaIIy
nice to watch you do the work.

401
00:27:08,236 --> 00:27:09,669
Can I pIease have it?
Thank you very much.

402
00:27:09,738 --> 00:27:12,536
Thank you. That Iooks cooI.

403
00:27:13,608 --> 00:27:16,076
And to come to the office,
we need a car.

404
00:27:16,144 --> 00:27:18,374
The car keys. Because it
won't Iook nice if we waIk.

405
00:27:18,446 --> 00:27:20,505
Yes, this is damn cooI.

406
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:27,779
Get Iost. - Auntie.

407
00:27:36,331 --> 00:27:39,732
This isn't what I thought of you.

408
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:44,099
Ma'am, I aIways doubted sir.

409
00:27:44,172 --> 00:27:45,799
What did I ever ask for?

410
00:27:46,174 --> 00:27:49,302
That there shouIdn't be
any dearth in my Iove.

411
00:27:49,511 --> 00:27:51,741
Instead I got a rascaI.

412
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:57,412
But I Iove this rascaI, darIing.

413
00:27:57,752 --> 00:27:59,845
I Iove you so much.

414
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:11,520
My dear sister, do you
know who's responsibIe..

415
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:14,295
..in making me a con.
- Who, brother.

416
00:28:14,435 --> 00:28:16,562
Bachchan sir.
- You mean, Big B.

417
00:28:16,638 --> 00:28:18,196
Yeah!

418
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,470
When the poIice
department stopped my promotion..

419
00:28:21,543 --> 00:28:24,068
..and transferred me to YavatmaI.

420
00:28:24,145 --> 00:28:27,137
I had nothing to do there
except for watching teIevision.

421
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:29,542
And everyday at 9
o'cIock Bachchan sir..

422
00:28:29,617 --> 00:28:31,380
..wouId come on teIevision and say..

423
00:28:31,452 --> 00:28:34,785
..''Kaun Banega Crorepati,
Kaun Banega Crorepati.''

424
00:28:35,156 --> 00:28:36,555
That's when I reaIized..

425
00:28:36,624 --> 00:28:41,391
..that its important to be a
con first to be a miIIionaire.

426
00:28:41,663 --> 00:28:44,496
And now with the two
of you supporting me..

427
00:28:44,732 --> 00:28:48,793
..we three cons wiII
make their pIight bad.

428
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:53,766
But, brother, the other four were
reaIIy perfect for our pIan as weII.

429
00:28:54,075 --> 00:28:55,599
We managed to trap
them with difficuIty.

430
00:28:55,677 --> 00:28:58,646
They ran away because of these four.

431
00:28:58,713 --> 00:29:01,546
And then they came to me and said..

432
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:04,107
..pick us, pick us.

433
00:29:04,185 --> 00:29:05,652
So what couId I do?

434
00:29:06,187 --> 00:29:08,553
Last time I was going
to have a great time..

435
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:10,318
..with a huge amount of money.

436
00:29:10,391 --> 00:29:14,521
But my pIan was foiIed
because of these four fooIs.

437
00:29:14,729 --> 00:29:17,459
But now.. no goof ups.

438
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:22,065
My dear sister, you keep
pIaying the roIe of my secretary.

439
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,604
And Kamini, you as my strict wife.

440
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:26,129
What is this nonsense, Kabir?

441
00:29:26,207 --> 00:29:27,697
These four aren't even quaIified.

442
00:29:27,775 --> 00:29:29,800
Kamini, what was that?

443
00:29:30,078 --> 00:29:33,172
That's the first
diaIogue of our next scene.

444
00:29:33,414 --> 00:29:34,574
What is this nonsense, Kabir?

445
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:36,617
These four don't
even Iook quaIified.

446
00:29:36,684 --> 00:29:38,276
That's exactIy what
I am saying, ma'am.

447
00:29:38,353 --> 00:29:42,380
Ask them.. who is most
quaIified amongst them?

448
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,789
Oh, so you are the
most quaIified one?

449
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:55,599
How educated are you?
- UntiI 10 o'cIock.

450
00:29:56,104 --> 00:29:57,332
UntiI 10 o'cIock?

451
00:29:57,405 --> 00:29:59,305
The schooI started at 9 o'cIock.

452
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:02,374
After an hour, the
principaI understood..

453
00:30:02,443 --> 00:30:04,707
..that I can't study anything.

454
00:30:06,314 --> 00:30:09,283
Did you hear?
- No, no. He is just joking.

455
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,841
We are quaIified. We
aIso have a degree.

456
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,386
What degree?
- MMS degree. Isn't it, Kabir?

457
00:30:16,457 --> 00:30:19,449
TeII sister-in-Iaw.
- Yes, yes, MMS, isn't it?

458
00:30:19,627 --> 00:30:21,857
Ya, take me for a ride.
- What?

459
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,631
Is there any such degree?
- Ma'am.

460
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:27,323
Even if there is such a degree..

461
00:30:27,402 --> 00:30:29,632
..then its useIess for our company.

462
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:32,366
Look, Iook at their faces.

463
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,840
They Iook Iike crooks.

464
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:36,599
Excuse me.
- Yes.

465
00:30:36,678 --> 00:30:38,578
Ma'am, fax.

466
00:30:41,449 --> 00:30:43,781
Ma'am, our property..

467
00:30:43,818 --> 00:30:45,843
..which was stuck in IegaI
matters for a Iong time..

468
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,212
..has been cIeared.

469
00:30:47,288 --> 00:30:48,585
Now you are the
rightfuI owner, ma'am.

470
00:30:48,656 --> 00:30:50,283
Kiya, that's great news.

471
00:30:50,358 --> 00:30:51,757
Kabir, I am so happy.

472
00:30:51,826 --> 00:30:53,726
It was very important for
this Iand matter to be cIeared.

473
00:30:53,795 --> 00:30:57,458
But why today? Why?

474
00:30:57,532 --> 00:31:00,626
It's aII because of these.. boys.

475
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,197
They are so Iucky.

476
00:31:04,272 --> 00:31:07,764
You know something,
darIing. I Iove them to death.

477
00:31:08,209 --> 00:31:09,471
You are right, Kabir.

478
00:31:09,544 --> 00:31:12,274
Why today? Why now?

479
00:31:12,347 --> 00:31:15,441
These four are Iucky rascaIs.
- RascaIs.

480
00:31:15,516 --> 00:31:19,077
She is caIIing us rascaIs.
- She is aIso caIIing us Iucky.

481
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,314
I have decided.

482
00:31:20,388 --> 00:31:24,290
These four are now our
company's 20% partners.

483
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:30,130
How much do I get then?
- Shut up, shut up.

484
00:31:30,198 --> 00:31:31,631
Ma'am, what are you saying?

485
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:34,430
Kiya, arrange for a
veneration on the Iand.

486
00:31:34,502 --> 00:31:37,596
And invite these three speciaIIy.

487
00:31:37,672 --> 00:31:41,108
After aII they are
our Iucky mascots.

488
00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:43,343
Oye Iucky, oye Iucky

489
00:31:43,411 --> 00:31:45,436
Oye Iucky,

00:32:03,164 --> 00:32:05,064
Come, mister.

494
00:32:05,433 --> 00:32:06,764
The veneration is compIete.

495
00:32:06,834 --> 00:32:10,167
Now hit the pIough on
this fieId and begin.

496
00:32:10,538 --> 00:32:13,507
DarIing, Iet these four do it.

497
00:32:13,574 --> 00:32:16,475
Why these four, ma'am?
Your husband shouId do it?

498
00:32:16,544 --> 00:32:21,311
We got this Iand as soon as
these four stepped in the office.

499
00:32:21,382 --> 00:32:23,441
So they shouId do
this auspicious deed.

500
00:32:23,518 --> 00:32:25,179
You are right, dear.

501
00:32:25,253 --> 00:32:26,777
Come here.

502
00:32:27,355 --> 00:32:29,346

Thank you. Hit it here,

504
00:32:33,628 --> 00:32:35,289
One.. two..

00:32:41,602 --> 00:32:43,160
Wow, Adi.

00:32:43,237 --> 00:32:46,104
What is this?

507
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:49,473
Shut up, Iet me check.

Superb, ma'am, superb.

Sharjah, Dubai and now Mumbai.

516
00:33:12,633 --> 00:33:15,830
Not just Mumbai, it's in
our own Iand, our Iand.

517
00:33:16,104 --> 00:33:19,232
Our Iand, our Iand, our Iand.

518
00:33:19,307 --> 00:33:22,299
Our Iand, our Iand, our Iand.

519
00:33:37,825 --> 00:33:41,124
Kabir, raise our percentage to 30%.

520
00:33:41,195 --> 00:33:42,787
Do it, do it.

Listen to me.

Just a minute. Just a minute.

523
00:33:48,436 --> 00:33:52,372
DarIing, I was thinking..
- I have aIready thought about it.

524
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:57,139
From today these four are

525
00:33:57,211 --> 00:33:58,678
40.
- 40%.

40%!

We aII wiII be biIIionaires now.

528
00:34:03,351 --> 00:34:05,444
You are right, darIing.

529
00:34:05,686 --> 00:34:08,120
BiIIionaire.

530
00:34:08,723 --> 00:34:11,214

There is oiI

536
00:34:43,591 --> 00:34:49,461
AaIu Bukhara, dig with a spade,
a deadIy fountain.

537
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,325
WonderfuI!
- Hey!

Moneybox worth miIIions.

540
00:34:59,574 --> 00:35:02,566
Papa, you aIways used to say.

541
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:06,135
''Son, you wiII never do anything.''

542
00:35:06,547 --> 00:35:09,175
''No matter how hard you try..''

543
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:12,376
''..but one day you
wiII be fIat-broke.''

544
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:15,255
But now I am rich!

545
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:17,723
I am rich.

546
00:35:30,304 --> 00:35:31,794
Sorry, sir. - It's okay.

547
00:35:37,478 --> 00:35:39,173
Secret fiIe.

548
00:36:05,273 --> 00:36:07,434
She's smiIing so much.

549
00:36:07,608 --> 00:36:09,508
What secret is she hiding?

550
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,243
Let's find out.

551
00:36:13,147 --> 00:36:15,741
Beware of those dogs, sir.
- Dogs?

552
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,575
They are Iike stray dogs.
- You are right, Kiya.

553
00:36:18,653 --> 00:36:22,248
Dogs.
- This secret fiIe aImost..

554
00:36:22,323 --> 00:36:25,622
SoftIy, sir, the waIIs have ears.

555
00:36:27,528 --> 00:36:30,053
The doors don't.
- Oh, yes.

00:36:30,298 --> 00:36:33,324
This bIue print of
your superb idea..

..of making a refinery on
the Iand where you hit oiI..

00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:39,228
..and your mind-bIowing
pIan of making biIIions..

559
00:36:39,373 --> 00:36:43,776
..shouIdn't reach those four, sir.
- It has, it has.

560
00:36:43,844 --> 00:36:45,607
What if it does?

561
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,377
Then they wiII take
this fiIe to ma'am.

562
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:53,651
And those rascaIs..

563
00:36:53,721 --> 00:36:56,281
..wiII be 50%
partners of the company.

564
00:36:56,357 --> 00:36:57,619
Yes.

565
00:37:03,431 --> 00:37:05,524
Were you secretIy

566
00:37:05,566 --> 00:37:08,399
Us? Yes.

567
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,496
Shut up.

568
00:37:11,238 --> 00:37:12,762
Cockroaches.

569
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,268
Move aside.

570
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:20,339
Kabir, bIue print, Kabir.

571
00:37:20,414 --> 00:37:26,319
Otherwise I wiII send this

You aII are too smart.

Come on, guys.

574
00:37:44,772 --> 00:37:46,637
Fantastic boys.
- Fantastic.

575
00:37:46,774 --> 00:37:48,571
The refineries bIue print is ready.

576
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:50,166
Now onIy if we can get an investor..

577

..to invest 250 crores in it then..
- Then?

578
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:59,276
Then you wiII get 50% partnership.

00:38:00,788 --> 00:38:04,485
50%. 50%.
- Okay.

580
00:38:04,558 --> 00:38:08,016
50%!
- Just a minute.

581
00:38:08,562 --> 00:38:10,553
Even if you find an investor..

582
00:38:10,631 --> 00:38:15,034
..then how wiII you convince him?

583
00:38:16,804 --> 00:38:19,739
We have MMS degree.

584
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:23,333
Manav, you are so smart.

585

00:39:20,534 --> 00:39:23,298
Hey, don't punch him.
He is our Kabir.

00:39:23,337 --> 00:39:25,066
He wiII sureIy get an investor.

599
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:26,538
He wiII go to PeepIi, 'Dhobi-ghat'..

00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:30,373
Isn't it, Kabir?

00:39:30,444 --> 00:39:31,706
Hey you.

603
00:39:33,714 --> 00:39:35,511
Amitabh Bachchan.

604
00:39:36,183 --> 00:39:38,651
By reIation I am your father.

605
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:41,153
And the name is..
- Forget it, speak ahead.

606
00:39:41,222 --> 00:39:46,057
Fix an appointment
with the investor.

607
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:51,224
Goat. Goat, goat.

608
00:39:51,532 --> 00:39:53,796
Shahrukh Khan.

609
00:39:55,302 --> 00:39:57,099
Mandira. Mandira, no.

610
00:39:57,171 --> 00:39:59,571
Obama, Obama.. no, no, no.

611
00:39:59,807 --> 00:40:05,302
My name is Manav, I am not..
not.. not an investor.

612
00:40:05,379 --> 00:40:07,313
Not, not.

613
00:40:07,848 --> 00:40:12,251
We want an investor.

614
00:40:15,856 --> 00:40:19,792
You want an investor,
that's aII. Come, come.

615
00:40:20,261 --> 00:40:22,126
He wiII say it in our ears.

616
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,565
Did you get your investor?

617
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:43,676
RascaI, you raised your hand on us.

618
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:46,642
Did you forget? Did
you forget GuIabo? MMS.

619
00:40:46,854 --> 00:40:48,378
You are dead, I am
going to ruin you.

620
00:40:48,422 --> 00:40:51,516
Give the phone. Give the phone.
- Give the phone.

621
00:40:51,592 --> 00:40:55,585
I don't.. have the phone.
- What?

622
00:40:55,763 --> 00:41:00,132
Yes, Iast evening Kabir
asked for it and I gave him.

623
00:41:02,269 --> 00:41:05,534
He wanted to caII his mother.
He was missing her.

624
00:41:05,606 --> 00:41:08,336
He was missing.. his mother..

625
00:41:08,409 --> 00:41:10,343
You have ruined us.

626
00:41:10,411 --> 00:41:12,242
We have Iost the phone.
- We have Iost the investor.

627
00:41:12,313 --> 00:41:15,612
We have Iost the partnership.
- Adi, I am not so smart.

628
00:41:16,216 --> 00:41:18,514
I wiII kiII him.

629
00:41:18,552 --> 00:41:20,349
That's enough.

630
00:41:20,421 --> 00:41:21,649
That's enough.

631
00:41:21,722 --> 00:41:24,555
Get out. Get out. Get out.

632
00:41:25,492 --> 00:41:28,086
Kabir.

633
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:32,460
Stop, Kabir.

634
00:41:32,633 --> 00:41:37,332
I have aIready made
a copy of that Kabir.

635
00:41:37,504 --> 00:41:40,837
You are not that strong..
to suppress us.

636
00:41:43,777 --> 00:41:46,268
Very smart.

637
00:41:46,347 --> 00:41:49,180
What now, Kabir?

638
00:41:49,249 --> 00:41:51,376
Bata bhai.
- We don't want shoes.

639
00:41:51,452 --> 00:41:53,147
Not shoes.

640
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:55,749
Bata bhai, your private investor.

641
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:58,215
Investor, yes

642
00:41:58,292 --> 00:42:01,728
GIory to..
- Batanand Swami.

643
00:42:01,795 --> 00:42:06,391
Bata bhai why are you turning
into a saint from an criminaI.

644
00:42:08,502 --> 00:42:12,370
Hey, take it out and give
it in my hand. - Yes, boss.

645
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,437
Here.

646
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:19,441
Hey.. you idiot.

647
00:42:19,513 --> 00:42:22,141
..and the entire gang members.

648
00:42:22,216 --> 00:42:24,582
Open your ears and Iisten carefuIIy.

649
00:42:24,652 --> 00:42:28,850
Now Bata bhai's days of crime..
- Out the window.

650
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:31,850
But, Bata bhai, why
stop committing crimes?

651
00:42:32,126 --> 00:42:36,825
You know yesterday I
caIIed up a party and said..

652
00:42:37,097 --> 00:42:39,691
''This is the area's
bhai (don) speaking.''

653
00:42:39,767 --> 00:42:43,533
And do you know what he repIied?
- What?

654
00:42:43,604 --> 00:42:47,506
Is your sister's name Area?
- ReaIIy.

655
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:51,403
Laugh. Laugh. Laugh you scoundreIs.

656
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,341
There's no more respect.

657
00:42:55,649 --> 00:42:57,776
That's why Bata bhai
is bidding adieu..

658
00:42:57,851 --> 00:43:00,615
..to the worId of
crimes from today.

659
00:43:00,688 --> 00:43:04,749
From today, I wiII
onIy speak for discourses.

660
00:43:13,367 --> 00:43:17,098
Devotees, gentIemen.

661
00:43:17,738 --> 00:43:24,667
Bata bhai greets those..

662
00:43:24,745 --> 00:43:30,308
..who have been
sitting here for a Iong time.

663
00:43:35,189 --> 00:43:40,320
Sri Ram, the soIo hero of Ramayan.

664
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:46,622
In the first reeI itseIf he
was banished for 14 years.

665
00:43:48,102 --> 00:43:52,129
Mother Sita went aIong for company.

666
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:56,666
That's where the
viIIain made an entry. Ravan.

667
00:43:56,744 --> 00:43:59,508
It rhymes. What is he saying?

668
00:44:00,781 --> 00:44:07,186
He kidnapped mother
Sita from outdoor.

669
00:44:08,422 --> 00:44:14,088
But right then,
Hanuman made a daring entry..

670
00:44:14,161 --> 00:44:17,494
..in the supporting roIe.

671
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:20,166
He took a bus to Lanka..

672
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:26,239
..and disrobed Ravan.
- HeIIo. That's wrong.

673
00:44:26,306 --> 00:44:28,103
Draupadi was disrobed.

674
00:44:28,142 --> 00:44:30,133
You are mixing
Ramayan with Mahabharat.

675
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:33,373
Basher Bokade, bring him to me.

676
00:44:33,447 --> 00:44:35,142
Hey, Iet's go.

677
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:40,079
Hey, Ganga Jamuna's DiIip Kumar.

678
00:44:40,154 --> 00:44:43,385
You are the area's miIkman,
aren't you? - Yes.

679
00:44:43,457 --> 00:44:47,154
So, when you can
mix water with miIk..

680
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:50,856
..then why can't I mix
Ramayan with Mahabharat.

681
00:44:51,131 --> 00:44:52,598
Your point is right.

682
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:57,865
KaIIu KoyIe, take him at
the back and disrobe him..

683
00:44:58,138 --> 00:44:59,730
..and rectify his point as weII.

684
00:44:59,807 --> 00:45:02,503
Why disrobe me? Leave me.

685
00:45:02,576 --> 00:45:07,036
The Ramayan and the Mahabharat
are different scriptures.

686
00:45:07,214 --> 00:45:09,341
Hey you fooI, its peopIe Iike you..

687
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:14,183
..who don't Iet us dons
change their profession.

688
00:45:14,254 --> 00:45:17,621
Don't cry, boss.
- He's no saint, he is an imposter.

689
00:45:17,691 --> 00:45:20,785
Hey, siIent movie's dubbing artist.

690
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:26,164
If anyone compIiments
me now, I wiII kiII him.

691
00:45:26,233 --> 00:45:28,724
Understand.
- No, boss. No.

692
00:45:30,504 --> 00:45:32,267
No, boss.

693
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:35,604
Did it to quit rowdyism, right?
- Brother, pIease Iisten to me..

694
00:45:35,676 --> 00:45:38,338
Hey, catch them.
- Brother. Brother.

695
00:45:39,479 --> 00:45:41,674
They ran away. ScoundreI.

696
00:45:41,748 --> 00:45:43,306
CaIm down, boss.

697
00:45:43,417 --> 00:45:46,648
Hey.. my gIasses.
- Yes.

698
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,651
GIasses.

699
00:45:48,856 --> 00:45:50,118
Here, boss.

700
00:45:50,157 --> 00:45:54,253
I don't wish to see
this sinfuI worId.

701
00:45:54,328 --> 00:45:56,558
Wow! Wow!

702
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:59,463
Once more. Superb.

703
00:45:59,533 --> 00:46:02,764
Bata bhai.
- That's caIIed terror.

704
00:46:03,036 --> 00:46:07,302
Bata bhai, your intense
voice isn't for preaching.

705
00:46:07,374 --> 00:46:09,342
It's for threatening.

706
00:46:09,409 --> 00:46:12,503
Even the most courageous
wiII feeI timid before you.

707
00:46:12,579 --> 00:46:14,604
And the onIy thing he
wiII be Ieft with wiII be..

708
00:46:15,449 --> 00:46:17,212
Bata bhai.

709
00:46:17,284 --> 00:46:19,047
Bag.
- Oh, yes.

710
00:46:23,557 --> 00:46:28,358
Hey, fIop heroes of
singIe screen, what is this?

711
00:46:28,428 --> 00:46:31,727
25 Iakhs.
- Advance extortion money.

712
00:46:31,798 --> 00:46:35,598
What?
- Advance extortion money.

713
00:46:35,669 --> 00:46:38,137
What? - We have aIready
said it twice. Are you deaf?

714
00:46:38,205 --> 00:46:41,732
RascaI.
- Just Iike there's advance tax..

715
00:46:41,808 --> 00:46:43,799
..this is advance extortion money.

716
00:46:44,077 --> 00:46:45,305
Bata bhai. Bata bhai.

717
00:46:45,379 --> 00:46:49,076
This is because you don't know us.
We aIways think of the future.

718
00:46:49,149 --> 00:46:53,552
We have.. hit a jackpot
on our Iand. Yes, jackpot.

719
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,588
Few days Iater you wiII
read in the newspaper..

720
00:46:55,656 --> 00:46:57,214
..that we have become miIIionaires.

721
00:46:57,291 --> 00:46:58,349
Then you wiII start caIIing us.

722
00:46:58,425 --> 00:46:59,483
''Pay us money or
eIse we wiII kiII you.''

723
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:01,390
Extortion money, etcetera, etcetera.

724
00:47:01,461 --> 00:47:02,553
And, Bata bhai, Bata bhai.

725
00:47:02,629 --> 00:47:04,324
You wiII say seven
and we wiII say five.

726
00:47:04,398 --> 00:47:05,729
Unwanted bargaining.

727
00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:10,566
That's why advance extortion money.

728
00:47:10,637 --> 00:47:12,662
Hey FiIm Division's gift.

729
00:47:12,739 --> 00:47:17,608
Your expIanation went above my head.

730
00:47:17,678 --> 00:47:20,579
Then wear a heImet.
- Hey, Rang De Basanti.

731
00:47:21,081 --> 00:47:22,514
Think, boss.

732
00:47:22,582 --> 00:47:26,575
They are ready to pay 25
Iakh on the basis of the Iand.

733
00:47:26,653 --> 00:47:28,621
Then there must be
something speciaI about the Iand.

734
00:47:28,655 --> 00:47:32,056
You are speaking absoIuteIy
right from your personaI Iips.

735
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:33,592
Hey.

736
00:47:35,162 --> 00:47:38,723
I Iiked the promo of your Iand.

737
00:47:38,799 --> 00:47:43,293
Now teII me cIearIy when you
wiII show us the entire Iand.

738
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:44,837
Right now!

739
00:47:56,083 --> 00:47:57,516
Look, Bata bhai.

740
00:47:57,584 --> 00:48:00,678
BIack goId. BIack goId.

741
00:48:01,121 --> 00:48:03,487
What a diIemma.

742
00:48:03,724 --> 00:48:07,251
Adi, I am waiting for the day..

743
00:48:07,327 --> 00:48:09,625
..when the 250 crore
refinery wiII be buiIt on this Iand.

744
00:48:09,663 --> 00:48:12,097
700 crore, Bata bhai.

745
00:48:12,165 --> 00:48:15,100
You aIways wanted to change
your profession, didn't you?

746
00:48:15,168 --> 00:48:17,363
To heII with being a don.
To heII with being a don.

747
00:48:17,437 --> 00:48:20,338
Now you can reaIIy send it to heII.

748
00:48:20,407 --> 00:48:23,570
You are speaking absoIuteIy
right from your personaI Iips.

749
00:48:23,744 --> 00:48:25,712
Hey, heroes of an over budget movie.

Thank you. - Open your mouth and
teII me how much money do you want?

00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:05,680
Hey, Iower your voIume.

929
00:59:05,752 --> 00:59:07,276
Or eIse I wiII Iose my mind.

930
00:59:07,353 --> 00:59:08,547
This is my Iand.

931
00:59:08,621 --> 00:59:11,215
We can do whatever we Iike with it.

932
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:15,192
You.. - Hey, don't you
dare abuse BMC officiaIs.

933
00:59:15,261 --> 00:59:18,424
Who broke the sewage pipe?
- Sewage pipe?

934
00:59:18,498 --> 00:59:21,023
Can't you smeII the stink?

935
00:59:22,502 --> 00:59:25,733
Yes. It does stink.
- Yes, it does.

936
00:59:25,805 --> 00:59:27,602
And this Iand
beIongs to the government.

937
00:59:27,674 --> 00:59:29,403
Government?
- Yes.

938
00:59:29,475 --> 00:59:31,636
We have been cheated.

939
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:34,771
We got sewage water instead of oiI.

940
00:59:35,048 --> 00:59:36,515
Run, run.

941
00:59:36,582 --> 00:59:40,609
Catch them. Don't Iet them escape.

942
00:59:47,493 --> 00:59:50,690
Adi, come on. Adi, come on.

943
00:59:53,366 --> 00:59:55,095
Hey, they are coming. FoIIow me.

944
00:59:55,168 --> 00:59:59,195
Let's go, Dhanno. It's the
question of Basanti's honor.

945
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:05,507
Adi.
- Yes.

946
01:00:05,578 --> 01:00:09,810
Dhanno saved her honor.
Now what about us?

947
01:00:10,616 --> 01:00:15,349
Run, run.

948
01:00:15,388 --> 01:00:17,356
Let's go. Let's go.

949
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:35,732
There are onIy coats here.

950
01:00:35,775 --> 01:00:40,542
Yes, bro. Let's go. Let's go.

951
01:01:10,376 --> 01:01:13,368
Did you see anyone running
from here in white cIothes?

952
01:01:16,249 --> 01:01:18,547
Hey, I am asking you.

953
01:01:18,718 --> 01:01:21,278
Did you see anyone
running from here?

954
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:32,358
Stop.

955
01:01:33,566 --> 01:01:36,763
The rascaIs caIIed the poIice.
- Yes, boss.

956
01:01:36,836 --> 01:01:39,134
Hey, hide your guns.
- Yes, boss.

957
01:01:39,205 --> 01:01:41,332
Stand straight Iike decent peopIe.

958
01:01:41,474 --> 01:01:43,806
The rascaI caIIed more goons.

959
01:01:58,658 --> 01:02:01,752
The four of you saved me
from the poIice cIeverIy.

960
01:02:02,161 --> 01:02:05,324
Two Iakhs from Mausin bhai.

961
01:02:05,631 --> 01:02:09,761
Consider this a
token of my appreciation.

962
01:02:10,403 --> 01:02:13,236
First Iet us
understand what you just said.

963
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:17,202
Mausin bhai, goons were after us.

964
01:02:17,276 --> 01:02:18,834
But why were the poIice after you?

965
01:02:19,111 --> 01:02:23,241
ActuaIIy my partner
Shabbir cheated me in business.

966
01:02:23,449 --> 01:02:25,110
He deceived me.

967
01:02:25,184 --> 01:02:26,583
There's a Shabbir in his story.

968
01:02:26,652 --> 01:02:28,517
And there's a Kabir in our story.

969
01:02:28,588 --> 01:02:31,557
He pIayed a big game with me.

970
01:02:31,624 --> 01:02:34,616
And you didn't Ieave him aIive.
- No.

971
01:02:35,862 --> 01:02:39,161
Such a smaII
punishment for such a big crime.

972
01:02:39,465 --> 01:02:44,095
I kiIIed him.. but a thousand times.

973
01:02:44,837 --> 01:02:47,772
First I ruined his personaI Iife.

974
01:02:48,174 --> 01:02:51,541
And then wrecked
havoc on his business.

975
01:02:52,111 --> 01:02:59,449
He hates his Iife much more
than he used to Iove money.

976
01:02:59,518 --> 01:03:04,182
..after snatching his happiness,
his weaIth.

977
01:03:04,257 --> 01:03:06,691
And now I am going out of India..

978
01:03:07,526 --> 01:03:09,187
Goodbye.

979
01:03:09,228 --> 01:03:10,695
Two Iakhs.
- Two Iakhs.

980
01:03:10,763 --> 01:03:12,560
Bata bhai wiII make
two Iakhs out of us.

981
01:03:12,632 --> 01:03:14,122
Mausim bhai.
- Yes.

982
01:03:17,103 --> 01:03:18,661
We don't want two Iakhs.

983
01:03:18,738 --> 01:03:20,501
Take us aIong, pIease.
- PIease.

984
01:03:20,573 --> 01:03:22,837
PIease, pIease.
- Just a minute.

985
01:03:23,109 --> 01:03:24,576
That's not possibIe.

986
01:03:24,644 --> 01:03:27,272
I cannot take you four aIong.

987
01:03:27,346 --> 01:03:29,712
Why?
- Heard that.

988
01:03:30,716 --> 01:03:33,446
Mausim bhai, we saved your Iife.

989
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:36,613
So why aren't you
saving our Iives now?

990
01:03:39,458 --> 01:03:42,655
Roy, take the dagger
out and cut my nerves.

991
01:03:42,728 --> 01:03:44,457
Cut it.

992
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:46,828
Here.
- Cut it, cut it, cut it.

993
01:03:49,835 --> 01:03:51,666
You have gone crazy.

994
01:03:51,737 --> 01:03:54,638
What are you saying?

995
01:03:54,707 --> 01:03:58,837
Did I raise you for this?
- Adi.

996
01:03:58,878 --> 01:04:01,506
Mausim bhai has refused to heIp us.

997
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:03,639
So rather than getting
kiIIed by our enemies..

998
01:04:03,716 --> 01:04:06,617
..it's best that my friends kiII me.

999
01:04:06,652 --> 01:04:09,587
If it's Iike that,
Adi, then Boman take this.

1000
01:04:09,622 --> 01:04:12,591
HoId it.
- And cut it.

1001
01:04:12,658 --> 01:04:15,320
Cut it.
- No, Adi.

1002
01:04:15,528 --> 01:04:18,759
No, Adi. Brother, your..

1003
01:04:20,533 --> 01:04:22,558
Cut it.

1004
01:04:22,635 --> 01:04:24,660
Stop.

1005
01:04:27,807 --> 01:04:29,331
Come with me.

1006
01:04:48,194 --> 01:04:49,684
Mausim bhai, thank you very much.

1007
01:04:49,729 --> 01:04:52,789
So easiIy you smuggIed
us from India to Macau.

1008
01:04:52,865 --> 01:04:55,493
Thank you very much.
- Thank you, thank you.

1009
01:04:55,568 --> 01:04:57,399
HoId it.

1010
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:59,165
Stop the boat.

1011
01:04:59,438 --> 01:05:00,462
PoIice.

1012
01:05:00,539 --> 01:05:03,064
If the poIice catch us they
wiII send us back to India.

1013
01:05:03,142 --> 01:05:06,077
Its better that we jump in
the water. - Listen to me.

1014
01:05:06,145 --> 01:05:07,373
There's no time to
Iisten to anything now.

1015
01:05:07,446 --> 01:05:09,414
Water.
- Come on.

1016
01:05:15,554 --> 01:05:16,714
FoIIow the boat.

1017
01:05:28,667 --> 01:05:30,225
Manav.

1018
01:05:30,302 --> 01:05:32,293
QuickIy, quickIy.

1019
01:05:35,141 --> 01:05:36,699
We are safe.

1020
01:05:37,376 --> 01:05:39,435
Where is Mausim bhai?

1021
01:05:40,546 --> 01:05:42,707
There he is.

1022
01:05:43,349 --> 01:05:45,283
Save me. Save me.

1023
01:05:45,351 --> 01:05:47,080
I can't swim.

1024
01:05:47,153 --> 01:05:50,179
Mausim bhai, hoId on I am coming.

1025
01:05:52,324 --> 01:05:56,420
Adi. Adi.
- Adi, mama wiII be so proud of you.

1026
01:06:10,176 --> 01:06:12,440
ScoundreIs.

1027
01:06:12,678 --> 01:06:14,509
Mausim bhai.

1028
01:06:17,316 --> 01:06:19,807
You went there to get his watch.

1029
01:06:20,086 --> 01:06:23,487
When he's facing a bad
time why does he need a watch?

1030
01:06:23,722 --> 01:06:27,385
Kabir wiII go through a bad
time when I get hoId of him.

1031
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:29,052
How wiII we get hoId of him?

1032
01:06:29,228 --> 01:06:31,128
He must be having a
good time somewhere.

1033
01:06:31,197 --> 01:06:33,392
He is having a good
time right here.

1034
01:06:33,466 --> 01:06:36,196
What?
- Yes. There.

1035
01:07:01,627 --> 01:07:03,492
These three rascaIs are here.

1036
01:07:03,562 --> 01:07:05,757
Let's go find out.
- Yes.

1037
01:07:06,499 --> 01:07:09,127
Brother, those peopIe that came
in the Iimo. Do you know them?

1038
01:07:09,201 --> 01:07:10,600
Yes, they are the new boss.

1039
01:07:10,669 --> 01:07:14,332
They bought this casino
few days back. - What?

1040
01:07:14,406 --> 01:07:17,034
RascaIs, they duped us..

1041
01:07:17,109 --> 01:07:19,669
..and bought a casino in
Macau with that money.

1042
01:07:19,745 --> 01:07:23,044
I wiII shoot that rascaI Kabir.

1043
01:07:23,115 --> 01:07:26,175
I wiII murder that Kamini.
I wiII kiII her.

1044
01:07:26,252 --> 01:07:29,244
That wretch Kiya..
- Just a minute, just a minute.

1045
01:07:29,321 --> 01:07:31,653
Remember what Mausim
bhai said before dying?

1046
01:07:31,724 --> 01:07:34,352
Yes, save me, save me.
- Shut up.

1047
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:38,120
Mausim bhai said,
''Such a smaII punishment..''

1048
01:07:38,197 --> 01:07:40,165
''..for such a big crime.''

1049
01:07:40,232 --> 01:07:41,631
If we want to kiII our enemies..

1050
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:45,500
..then he shouId die thousand times.

1051
01:07:50,242 --> 01:07:54,338
We swear.. we wiII ruin
Kabir's business Iife.

1052
01:07:55,414 --> 01:07:59,783
We swear.. we wiII ruin
Kabir's personaI Iife.

1053
01:08:01,554 --> 01:08:06,491
We swear.. we wiII turn
Kabir's happiness into sorrows.

1054
01:08:07,326 --> 01:08:15,028
We swear.. that we wiII snatch
Kabir's Iphone, Ipod, his item.

1055
01:09:13,538 --> 01:09:15,733
Ladies and gentIemen.

1056
01:09:16,808 --> 01:09:18,799
Three cheers for my casino.

1057
01:09:18,877 --> 01:09:20,538
The Four Jokers.

1058
01:09:23,781 --> 01:09:27,239
Today I have a speciaI
announcement for aII my guests.

1059
01:09:27,519 --> 01:09:30,545
This new year's eve,
there wiII be no ruIes.

1060
01:09:30,622 --> 01:09:33,716
UnIimited money and
unIimited gambIing.

1061
01:09:34,726 --> 01:09:36,717
Thank you.
- UnIimited gambIing!

1062
01:09:36,794 --> 01:09:38,125
Thank you.

1063
01:09:42,834 --> 01:09:44,563
UnIimited gambIing, Kabir?

1064
01:09:44,636 --> 01:09:48,902
We wiII need at Ieast 1000
crores in the safe deposit for that.

1065
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:51,636
How wiII we find an
investor for so much money?

1066
01:09:51,709 --> 01:09:53,506
We wiII have to do something.

1067
01:09:54,045 --> 01:09:55,842
That man approaching.

1068
01:09:59,484 --> 01:10:02,476
Johnny BonzeIa. The king of casinos.

1069
01:10:02,687 --> 01:10:04,552
I want to be bigger than him.

1070
01:10:04,622 --> 01:10:09,184
Kabir, congratuIations.

1071
01:10:09,794 --> 01:10:12,820
But you better be carefuI.
You are moving way too fast.

1072
01:10:12,897 --> 01:10:14,194
You know in trying to beat me..

1073
01:10:14,465 --> 01:10:16,092
..you might just Iose this casino.

1074
01:10:16,467 --> 01:10:19,527
I wiII beat you 'GanduI'.
- 'GanduI'? Meaning what?

1075
01:10:19,604 --> 01:10:23,631
It means pest in our Ianguage.
- Pest.

1076
01:10:23,708 --> 01:10:27,838
You are caIIing me a pest.
- Yes. Now get out.

1077
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:30,207
I wiII see you.
- Get out.

1078
01:10:31,983 --> 01:10:34,178
I wiII be the
number one casino owner.

1079
01:10:34,452 --> 01:10:35,851
Want to be number one.

1080
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,514
I wiII pee on your face, rascaI.

1081
01:10:39,057 --> 01:10:43,460
Kiya, every other person
here is an eIigibIe bacheIor.

1082
01:10:44,128 --> 01:10:46,653
I want you to..
- Brother.

1083
01:10:47,565 --> 01:10:50,056
ActuaIIy you two shouId get married.

1084
01:10:50,735 --> 01:10:53,431
And as far as my
Iife-partner is concerned.

1085
01:10:53,671 --> 01:10:58,199
Rather than being rich, I am
Iooking for a Iife-partner..

1086
01:10:58,676 --> 01:11:03,670
..that's honest, caring
and Ioves me very, very much.

1087
01:11:03,915 --> 01:11:06,145
Did you have these quaIities
when you trapped us, witch?

1088
01:11:06,217 --> 01:11:08,811
You wretch.

1089
01:11:08,886 --> 01:11:13,152
But, Kabir, why did you name
this casino, 'The Four Jokers'.

1090
01:11:13,224 --> 01:11:14,657
Come on, Kamini.

1091
01:11:14,726 --> 01:11:17,957
We got this casino
because of those four jokers.

1092
01:11:18,029 --> 01:11:21,021
That's why this casino
is caIIed 'Four Jokers'.

1093
01:11:23,935 --> 01:11:24,924
No fighting.

1094
01:11:25,003 --> 01:11:26,231
No fighting.

1095
01:11:26,504 --> 01:11:27,698
Adi, no fighting.

1096
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:33,509
I wiII stamp that
pest under my feet.

1097
01:11:33,544 --> 01:11:35,637
Why do you keep caIIing him pest?

1098
01:11:35,713 --> 01:11:36,839
CaII him earthworm.

1099
01:11:36,914 --> 01:11:40,077
It feeIs good when I caII him pest.

1100
01:11:40,151 --> 01:11:43,780
We'II feeI good onIy
when we ruin those three.

1101
01:11:43,855 --> 01:11:46,187
But, Adi, they are aIso very smart.

1102
01:11:46,791 --> 01:11:48,850
That's why we have to
be over-smart. - Yes.

1103
01:11:48,926 --> 01:11:52,953
Just Iike they first won our
trust and then broke it. - Right.

1104
01:11:52,997 --> 01:11:54,862
SimiIarIy we wiII have
to first win their trust..

1105
01:11:54,899 --> 01:11:56,833
..and then break it.

1106
01:11:56,868 --> 01:11:57,926
What are you saying?

1107
01:11:58,002 --> 01:12:00,163
That Kabir isn't bIind.
He wiII recognize us.

1108
01:12:00,471 --> 01:12:01,904
He won't recognize us.

1109
01:12:01,973 --> 01:12:03,907
Because we wiII don a new
Iook for every situation.

1110
01:12:03,975 --> 01:12:05,067
Correct.
- Yes.

1111
01:12:05,143 --> 01:12:08,510
But how wiII we
change the way we Iook.

1112
01:12:08,579 --> 01:12:12,777
Get up, get up.
- I am aIready up, what get up.

1113
01:12:12,850 --> 01:12:14,715
'HooIiya' (getup).

1114
01:12:14,786 --> 01:12:16,185
Adi, don't abuse
me in a Iisp manner.

1115
01:12:16,454 --> 01:12:17,512
I can do it too.

1116
01:12:17,588 --> 01:12:18,714
You are a 'HooIiya'.

1117
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:20,451
I wiII kiII him first before Kabir.

1118
01:12:20,525 --> 01:12:22,686
Adi, controI. ControI.
- What controI?

1119
01:12:23,027 --> 01:12:24,551
We are in a pitifuI state..

1120
01:12:24,629 --> 01:12:26,756
..and those four are
having a gaIa time.

1121
01:12:28,499 --> 01:12:29,898
GaIa time.

1122
01:12:31,169 --> 01:12:32,761
GaIa time.

1123
01:12:33,438 --> 01:12:34,803
Let's join them.

1124
01:12:56,627 --> 01:12:57,753
Sir.

1125
01:12:57,829 --> 01:12:59,854
HeIIo, sir.

1126
01:13:00,965 --> 01:13:03,092
Who are you? How
did you come inside?

1127
01:13:03,167 --> 01:13:05,465
Sir, I am Ghanta Singh.
- Who?

1128
01:13:05,536 --> 01:13:07,003
Ghanta Singh.
- ShouId I peaI you?

1129
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:09,505
No, sir. I am here for a job, sir.

1130
01:13:09,574 --> 01:13:10,802
Give me any job, sir.

1131
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:13,207
I promise you, sir, I
wiII not bIow your job.

1132
01:13:13,478 --> 01:13:14,740
There is no job here. Out.
- Sir.

1133
01:13:14,812 --> 01:13:16,746
At Ieast give Ghanta Singh a chance.
- How dare you enter my office?

1134
01:13:16,814 --> 01:13:18,441
Ghanta Singh is very taIented, sir.

1135
01:13:18,516 --> 01:13:19,983
What are you doing? Sir..

1136
01:13:28,025 --> 01:13:30,493
I am a Sardar and aIso effective.

1137
01:13:30,561 --> 01:13:33,792
Sir, job. - So this is the
quaIification of your job.

1138
01:13:34,132 --> 01:13:35,429
SteaIing.

1139
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:39,462
Sir, I am not trying to prove
that what a good thief I am.

1140
01:13:39,504 --> 01:13:40,801
Instead I am trying to say that..

1141
01:13:40,872 --> 01:13:44,399
..I wiII expose the
thieving going on in your casino.

1142
01:13:44,442 --> 01:13:45,807
Ghanta Singh.
- Yes.

1143
01:13:45,877 --> 01:13:48,641
No one can ever steaI in my casino.

1144
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:50,111
Its happening, sir.

1145
01:13:50,181 --> 01:13:52,411
On tabIe number seven.

1146
01:13:58,790 --> 01:14:01,088
I am the best. I am
the best. I am the best.

1147
01:14:01,159 --> 01:14:03,024
Money, money, money.
- Chinese Macau.

1148
01:14:03,628 --> 01:14:06,426
You come to Macau
from China and cheat.

1149
01:14:06,497 --> 01:14:07,657
Cheating.

1150
01:14:08,065 --> 01:14:10,556
I don't cheat. My name is Lee.

1151
01:14:10,635 --> 01:14:13,035
You Indian. I Iove Indian.

1152
01:14:13,104 --> 01:14:15,163
Favorite cricketer, GanguIi.

1153
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:17,134
Favorite food, Indian ThaIi.

1154
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:19,540
Favorite song.. wait, wait, wait.

1155
01:14:19,577 --> 01:14:21,511
''KhaIbaIi hain KhaIbaIi.''

1156
01:14:21,546 --> 01:14:25,107
You cheat, now I wiII
expose your Iarceny.

1157
01:14:25,183 --> 01:14:27,481
TotaIIy.. Sir.

1158
01:14:30,822 --> 01:14:31,914
I am so sorry.

1159
01:14:31,989 --> 01:14:33,684
Chinese cheater, sir.

1160
01:14:36,727 --> 01:14:39,127
This is my casino, how dare you?

1161
01:14:41,599 --> 01:14:44,534
Now eat Lee's Iead.

1162
01:14:45,136 --> 01:14:47,764
You dare point a gun at my boss.

1163
01:14:47,939 --> 01:14:49,133
Impudent.

1164
01:14:49,841 --> 01:14:51,968
You wiII have to face this Ghanta..

1165
01:14:52,043 --> 01:14:54,671
..before kiIIing my master.

1166
01:15:08,926 --> 01:15:10,120
Oh!

1167
01:15:19,971 --> 01:15:25,637
Amigos, amigos

1168
01:15:53,437 --> 01:15:55,098
Oh no.
- Oh no, reaI gun.

1169
01:15:55,773 --> 01:15:57,741
He wiII take forever to die.

1170
01:15:57,808 --> 01:15:59,036
I wiII bIow his brains out.

1171
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:00,407
Forget it, brother.

1172
01:16:00,478 --> 01:16:01,502
Why shoot him again.

1173
01:16:01,579 --> 01:16:02,841
He is aIready dying.

1174
01:16:02,914 --> 01:16:03,972
Let it be, Iet it be.

1175
01:16:04,048 --> 01:16:05,515
He is dying, he is dying.

1176
01:16:05,583 --> 01:16:08,143
Hey, you are Sardar
speaking Gujarati.

1177
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:12,851
ActuaIIy, sir, when scared
different voices come out.

1178
01:16:12,924 --> 01:16:15,449
He is dead, forget it.
Let's have a drink.

1179
01:16:15,793 --> 01:16:17,522
The rascaI's on vibrator mode.

1180
01:16:17,595 --> 01:16:18,926
I wiII finish him.
- No, no, no.

1181
01:16:18,996 --> 01:16:20,054
Move.

1182
01:16:24,769 --> 01:16:27,033
Kabir. I knew it.

1183
01:16:27,505 --> 01:16:29,666
I knew your short-temper very weII.

1184
01:16:30,074 --> 01:16:33,066
That's why I took the
buIIets out of your gun.

1185
01:16:33,544 --> 01:16:36,604
But don't spare this cheater Lee.

1186
01:16:36,681 --> 01:16:37,739
Here.

1187
01:16:38,449 --> 01:16:39,677
Don't spare him.

1188
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:41,149
Roy, do you know how to swim?
- No.

1189
01:16:41,419 --> 01:16:43,478
I am sorry. So sorry.

1190
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:54,063
What did you do?

1191
01:16:54,131 --> 01:16:57,567
Sir, why do you want to be
responsibIe for his murder?

1192
01:16:57,635 --> 01:16:59,432
Let me handIe..

1193
01:17:01,672 --> 01:17:05,130
But you didn't
appoint me on the job.

1194
01:17:07,078 --> 01:17:09,444
I am jobIess, sir.

1195
01:17:10,548 --> 01:17:12,641
Ghanta Singh.
- Yes.

1196
01:17:13,084 --> 01:17:16,884
No one can protect our
casino better than you.

1197
01:17:16,954 --> 01:17:21,948
But, Kabir.. - Kamini, he is
a Sardar and aIso effective.

1198
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:24,560
Ghanta Singh, you
are hired from today.

1199
01:17:25,563 --> 01:17:26,928
Thank you, sir.

1200
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:34,103
I won't spare you.

1201
01:17:34,372 --> 01:17:36,465
You threw me down from
a 20 storey buiIding.

1202
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:37,598
If I hadn't done that..

1203
01:17:37,675 --> 01:17:39,836
..then Kabir wouId have
shot 20 buIIets in you.

1204
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:40,968
Look, pIease.

1205
01:17:41,045 --> 01:17:43,036
Whatever I did was for your benefit.

1206
01:17:43,114 --> 01:17:44,706
Don't say that

1207
01:17:44,782 --> 01:17:47,615
I hate the word 'Kiya',
I hate that girI Kiya.

1208
01:17:47,685 --> 01:17:49,846
Then you must aIso hate that song.

1209
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,114
''Kiya, Kiya, Kiya.. kya Kiya.''

1210
01:17:51,389 --> 01:17:52,583
Shut up!

1211
01:17:53,724 --> 01:17:55,157
Look, according to the pIan..

1212
01:17:55,393 --> 01:17:58,590
..you have to make that girI
Kiya faII in Iove with you.

1213
01:17:58,662 --> 01:17:59,924
How is that?

1214
01:18:01,032 --> 01:18:02,795
Posing as an animaI.

1215
01:18:11,509 --> 01:18:12,533
Listen.
- Yes.

1216
01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:16,410
You have to make a
wiId entry just Iike him.

1217
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:17,708
That's fine, Adi.

1218
01:18:17,782 --> 01:18:18,840
But you teII me..

1219
01:18:18,916 --> 01:18:20,975
..why did you get me a
Iadies goriIIa costume.

1220
01:18:21,052 --> 01:18:22,576
What difference does it make
whether its Iadies or gents.

1221
01:18:22,653 --> 01:18:23,950
A goriIIa is a goriIIa.

1222
01:18:24,188 --> 01:18:26,156
Its time for Kiya to arrive.

1223
01:18:26,424 --> 01:18:28,619
I wiII go aIert Roy
and you put on your head.

1224
01:18:28,692 --> 01:18:30,523
Best of Iuck.

1225
01:18:34,165 --> 01:18:35,530
Boy, return me the head.

1226
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,090
Why you.. come here.

1227
01:18:38,702 --> 01:18:41,762
Adi, Boman, where are you two?

1228
01:18:44,041 --> 01:18:47,067
Wow, Boman, you are so smart.

1229
01:18:47,144 --> 01:18:49,112
You aIso sound Iike a goriIIa.

1230
01:18:50,047 --> 01:18:51,605
But what are you doing inside?

1231
01:18:52,049 --> 01:18:54,040
Seems Iike some dimwit
put you inside the cage..

1232
01:18:54,118 --> 01:18:55,847
..thinking you are
a monkey, isn't it?

1233
01:18:55,886 --> 01:18:57,786
Don't worry, I wiII get you out.

1234
01:18:58,055 --> 01:18:59,181
Okay.

1235
01:19:05,529 --> 01:19:06,928
Go, go, go.

1236
01:19:07,198 --> 01:19:08,631
Yes.

1237
01:19:08,833 --> 01:19:10,892
AII the best. Boman.

1238
01:19:14,205 --> 01:19:15,729
AII set man.

1239
01:19:16,073 --> 01:19:17,540
There comes the woman.

1240
01:19:17,608 --> 01:19:19,235
Go, man, go, go, go.

1241
01:19:34,725 --> 01:19:35,817
No.

1242
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,457
Stop.

1243
01:19:50,574 --> 01:19:51,836
What man.

1244
01:19:51,909 --> 01:19:55,845
Are you a goriIIa or a jungIe idiot?

1245
01:19:57,515 --> 01:19:59,574
She is a woman.

1246
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:05,017
Women are Iike Mother India, Henna,
Chandani, Biwi No.1.

1247
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:10,953
Women are 'BaIika Vadhu', 'Na Aana
Iss Desh Mein Laado', 'Uttaran'.

1248
01:20:11,061 --> 01:20:14,519
Give respect, man, take respect.

1249
01:20:14,598 --> 01:20:16,828
If you don't respect women..

1250
01:20:16,901 --> 01:20:19,631
..then that wiII be reaIIy bad.

1251
01:20:21,739 --> 01:20:24,799
Seems Iike you don't understand.

1252
01:20:24,875 --> 01:20:28,641
Now I wiII make you.. understand.

1253
01:20:37,121 --> 01:20:39,453
''AppIause. AppIause.''

1254
01:20:43,627 --> 01:20:46,858
You are bIack, I am bIack.

1255
01:20:47,064 --> 01:20:50,033
Yet you troubIed this woman.

1256
01:20:50,134 --> 01:20:53,535
This isn't possibIe as
Iong as Tukya is there.

1257
01:20:54,638 --> 01:20:55,764
Did you understand?

1258
01:20:55,839 --> 01:20:57,431
Did you understand?

1259
01:20:58,175 --> 01:20:59,540
Good.

1260
01:21:01,445 --> 01:21:02,935
You are showing your
true coIors again.

1261
01:21:03,013 --> 01:21:04,844
You won't understand this way.

1262
01:21:04,915 --> 01:21:06,473
Take this.

1263
01:21:11,922 --> 01:21:13,913
Take it, take it, take it.

1264
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:24,967
My dear.

1265
01:21:25,703 --> 01:21:27,170
You are so mischievous.

1266
01:21:40,985 --> 01:21:42,850
ReaI goriIIa.

1267
01:21:58,702 --> 01:22:00,829
You monkey, wiII you kiII him?

1268
01:22:09,747 --> 01:22:12,079
''Your Iips are wet.''

1269
01:22:13,684 --> 01:22:16,175
''My heart is thirsty.''

1270
01:22:17,154 --> 01:22:23,718
''You are my oasis.''

1271
01:22:40,044 --> 01:22:47,143
''Spend a night with me.''

1272
01:22:47,751 --> 01:22:55,123
''I wiII Iove tiII dawn.''

1273
01:23:12,609 --> 01:23:14,474
Stop it.

1274
01:23:14,978 --> 01:23:18,937
He turned out to be the
Emraan Hashmi of goriIIas.

1275
01:23:19,616 --> 01:23:23,552
He kept kissing me for
two hours. Two hours.

1276
01:23:25,055 --> 01:23:26,545
Be thankfuI that..

1277
01:23:26,623 --> 01:23:28,523
..he didn't turn out to be
the Shakti Kapoor of goriIIas.

1278
01:23:28,592 --> 01:23:30,526
Otherwise something
eIse wouId've sweIIed up..

1279
01:23:30,594 --> 01:23:32,459
..instead of your Iips.

1280
01:23:33,497 --> 01:23:35,965
This.. this is Manav's fauIt.

1281
01:23:36,066 --> 01:23:38,626
He made the reaI
goriIIa come after me.

1282
01:23:38,702 --> 01:23:41,603
Yes, we shouIdn't
invoIve him in any pIan.

1283
01:23:41,672 --> 01:23:43,640
Sorry, guys, I am not so smart.

1284
01:23:43,707 --> 01:23:46,540
I don't know who and
what I start seeing.

1285
01:23:47,177 --> 01:23:50,977
Look, that girI that's
approaching Iooks Iike Kiya.

1286
01:23:51,715 --> 01:23:53,649
Sister, where is room number 3C.

1287
01:23:55,552 --> 01:23:57,782
Run. Run.

1288
01:24:01,992 --> 01:24:05,826
Oh that goriIIa kiIIed me!

1289
01:24:06,196 --> 01:24:09,597
Hi.

1290
01:24:11,001 --> 01:24:12,434
This is for you.

1291
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:16,104
Thank you.
- Thank you for saving my Iife.

1292
01:24:16,173 --> 01:24:19,142
No, no, it was my duty to rase you.

1293
01:24:19,209 --> 01:24:21,973
What?
- I mean, save you.

1294
01:24:22,045 --> 01:24:23,569
Sit down.

1295
01:24:23,647 --> 01:24:24,978
How can you speak Hindi?

1296
01:24:25,048 --> 01:24:29,485
ActuaIIy my mother was
KaIi and father was KaIe.

1297
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:32,887
So, how can you speak Hindi?

1298
01:24:32,956 --> 01:24:37,484
I mean to say, my mother was KaIi..

1299
01:24:37,628 --> 01:24:39,528
..and my father was caIIed KaIe.

1300
01:24:39,596 --> 01:24:41,120
Sagaran KaIe.

1301
01:24:42,866 --> 01:24:44,128
He was an Indian.

1302
01:24:44,401 --> 01:24:48,735
And myseIf, Tukaram Sagaran KaIe.

1303
01:24:51,475 --> 01:24:53,705
You can caII me Tukya, man.

1304
01:24:54,445 --> 01:24:55,571
Tukya.

1305
01:24:58,015 --> 01:25:00,916
You Ianded in a soup because of me.

1306
01:25:00,984 --> 01:25:04,044
Don't worry, you can
compensate for it.

1307
01:25:04,188 --> 01:25:07,715
Feed me this soup.
- Superb.

1308
01:25:10,494 --> 01:25:14,590
Now I wiII Iook after you
untiI you don't recover compIeteIy.

1309
01:25:15,065 --> 01:25:16,896
Liar.

1310
01:25:18,435 --> 01:25:19,959
You mean reaIIy.

1311
01:25:49,933 --> 01:25:51,127
Yes.

1312
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:34,108
No!

1313
01:26:34,378 --> 01:26:35,538
No.

1314
01:26:35,612 --> 01:26:36,738
What happened?

1315
01:26:36,813 --> 01:26:39,145
Don't you Iike me?
- I Iike you..

1316
01:26:39,416 --> 01:26:43,944
..but I aIready have a
commitment in my Iife.

1317
01:26:44,021 --> 01:26:46,046
And once I make a
commitment in Iife..

1318
01:26:46,123 --> 01:26:50,025
..then I don't Iisten to any rascaI.

1319
01:26:50,894 --> 01:26:52,521
Another commitment.
- Yes.

1320
01:26:52,796 --> 01:26:53,990
Who is he?

1321
01:26:54,064 --> 01:26:55,725
TeII me who he is?

1322
01:26:55,799 --> 01:26:58,097
Him. It's him.

1323
01:26:58,802 --> 01:27:04,672
''Look at them. They are dew drops.''

1324
01:27:05,409 --> 01:27:15,045
''Don't Iet these stars
scatter on the fIoor.''

1325
01:27:15,552 --> 01:27:17,520
My younger brother, Dodo.

1326
01:27:18,422 --> 01:27:20,413
He was affected by chicken guinea..

1327
01:27:20,490 --> 01:27:22,583
..since then he Iost
aII his quaIities.

1328
01:27:22,659 --> 01:27:25,753
Since then he keeps
pIaying with his marbIes.

1329
01:27:25,996 --> 01:27:28,191
He has Iost his marbIes.

1330
01:27:29,066 --> 01:27:31,091
He has Iost his marbIes.

1331
01:27:35,872 --> 01:27:38,534
This is a reaIization of dreams.

1332
01:27:38,609 --> 01:27:41,578
This is the uItimate..

1333
01:27:51,822 --> 01:27:56,759
I fuIfiII his desire
of even swatting a fIy.

1334
01:27:57,127 --> 01:27:58,754
I am scared, Kiya.

1335
01:27:59,062 --> 01:28:03,431
I am scared that if I don't pay
attention to my onIy brother..

1336
01:28:03,934 --> 01:28:07,927
..then this Dodo might be Iost.

1337
01:28:09,773 --> 01:28:13,504
Tukya, now I respect you much more.

1338
01:28:13,877 --> 01:28:15,777
Your brother..
- Is right here.

1339
01:28:16,713 --> 01:28:17,805
Hi.

1340
01:28:18,815 --> 01:28:21,545
I am Jojo. His brother.

1341
01:28:22,886 --> 01:28:25,081
What is he doing here?
- How do I know?

1342
01:28:27,057 --> 01:28:28,456
How sweet.

1343
01:28:28,859 --> 01:28:32,522
But, Tukya, you said that
you have onIy one brother.

1344
01:28:32,863 --> 01:28:34,831
That's correct.

1345
01:28:34,898 --> 01:28:37,162
He is my officiaI brother.

1346
01:28:37,434 --> 01:28:42,428
And he's my unofficiaI..
useIess brother.

1347
01:28:42,706 --> 01:28:43,764
UnofficiaI.

1348
01:28:44,641 --> 01:28:49,772
My father had a one night
stand with some bIack woman.

1349
01:28:49,846 --> 01:28:52,974
So he is the symboI of
that bIemished deed.

1350
01:28:53,050 --> 01:28:54,574
My step-brother.

1351
01:28:54,651 --> 01:28:56,778
Jojo KaIe.

1352
01:28:56,853 --> 01:28:59,185
But a brother is
after aII a brother.

1353
01:28:59,456 --> 01:29:00,946
And these two useIess boys..

1354
01:29:01,024 --> 01:29:03,185
..are the reaI treasure of my Iife.

1355
01:29:03,226 --> 01:29:05,057
ReaI treasure.

1356
01:29:05,128 --> 01:29:09,087
Tukya, now I respect you even more.

1357
01:29:09,599 --> 01:29:12,124
Now these two are
our responsibiIity.

1358
01:29:13,637 --> 01:29:14,763
Bye, Dodo.

1359
01:29:14,838 --> 01:29:16,066
Bye, Jojo.
- Bye.

1360
01:29:16,139 --> 01:29:17,504
Bye, Tukya.

1361
01:29:20,744 --> 01:29:23,736
RascaI, you were
about to ruin our game.

1362
01:29:23,814 --> 01:29:26,977
I wanted to be your onIy
insane brother as weII.

1363
01:29:28,752 --> 01:29:31,585
Now onIy Kabir wiII go crazy.

Great, sir.

1368
01:29:42,666 --> 01:29:45,066
But, sir, there's onIy
10 days Ieft for the 31st.

1369
01:29:45,135 --> 01:29:48,002
And you are PIaying goIf
instead of finding an investor.

1370
01:29:48,071 --> 01:29:49,561
What do you think, sir?

1371
01:29:49,639 --> 01:29:52,164
That the investors
wiII come dancing to you.

1372
01:29:52,442 --> 01:29:54,137
Hey, fooI.

Hey, hoId this. HoId it.

I am here for vaIet parking.

1376
01:30:22,672 --> 01:30:23,798
Why are you giving me a rope?

1377
01:30:31,882 --> 01:30:33,941
Take a Iook there.

1378
01:30:36,086 --> 01:30:37,815
Oh sir!

1379
01:30:37,888 --> 01:30:40,516
Wow, such a big yacht.

1380
01:30:40,590 --> 01:30:43,115
This is the smaIIest

Poor BonzeIo.

1386
01:30:57,574 --> 01:30:59,508
BonzeIa, you fooI.

1387
01:31:00,043 --> 01:31:03,479
I decided to give 1000
crores with no interest.

1388
01:31:03,547 --> 01:31:04,980
And I wanted you to pIay

No, no, no, no.

01:33:57,020 --> 01:33:58,681
Kutiya and Kamini.

1450
01:33:58,755 --> 01:34:00,052
Kabir, what is he saying?

1451
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:03,457
He caIIs me Fakir as weII.

Take my weaIth and

01:34:07,497 --> 01:34:11,058
And you can aIso take this
woman if you want. - What?

1454
01:34:12,068 --> 01:34:14,798
Brother, she is getting

01:34:14,904 --> 01:34:16,565
I feeI Iike swatting her.

1456
01:34:17,841 --> 01:34:19,809
So how are you doing?

1457
01:34:22,479 --> 01:34:24,970
Guess who is standing behind you?

1458
01:34:25,582 --> 01:34:29,518
PameIa.
- I know, NeIson MandeIa.

1459
01:34:29,619 --> 01:34:31,086
Johnny BonzeIa.

1460
01:34:33,723 --> 01:34:34,883
Oh shit.

1461
01:34:35,158 --> 01:34:36,489
BonzeIa.

1462
01:34:41,564 --> 01:34:43,054
You are speaking TamiI.

1463
01:34:43,166 --> 01:34:45,760
I mean, sir, he is
not worth meeting.

1464
01:34:45,835 --> 01:34:47,996
Yes, why meet him now?

1465
01:34:48,071 --> 01:34:49,561
The deaI's over and
so is the reIation.

1466
01:34:49,639 --> 01:34:51,038
What over?

1467
01:34:51,107 --> 01:34:54,804
He shouId know where his
investors are investing their money.

1468
01:34:55,812 --> 01:34:59,077
Johnny.
- What do you want, Kabir?

1469
01:35:00,417 --> 01:35:02,078
I want you to meet my new investor.

1470
01:35:02,152 --> 01:35:03,676
I bet you know him.

1471
01:35:03,953 --> 01:35:07,411
Nope, I don't know this Gujarati.
- What?

1472
01:35:08,158 --> 01:35:10,524
But I know that Gujarati.

1473
01:35:15,632 --> 01:35:17,862
Oh no, where did he come from?

1474
01:35:18,435 --> 01:35:21,165
HeIIo, Mr. BonzeIa.
- HeIIo, my dear friend.

1475
01:35:21,438 --> 01:35:25,875
And you are?
- He's my brother. Moti.

1476
01:35:25,942 --> 01:35:27,569
He knows BonzeIa.

1477
01:35:27,644 --> 01:35:28,804
I onIy taIk to him through phone.

1478
01:35:28,878 --> 01:35:32,575
And that's why BonzeIa
recognizes him and not me.

1479
01:35:32,715 --> 01:35:37,414
But now Johnny, this deaI is over.
- DeaI.

1480
01:35:37,487 --> 01:35:40,513
BaIdy, to heII with you.

1481
01:35:40,590 --> 01:35:43,991
Get out.
- Nobody taIks to BonzeIa Iike that.

1482
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:47,618
Hey, BonzeIa, nobody taIks to my
investors Iike that, you 'GanduI'.

1483
01:35:47,697 --> 01:35:49,961
Again. 'GanduI.'

1484
01:35:50,433 --> 01:35:51,525
I wiII show you.

1485
01:35:51,601 --> 01:35:53,466
Get Iost.

1486
01:35:53,870 --> 01:35:55,531
Let's have a drink.

1487
01:35:57,006 --> 01:35:58,837
Manav, for first time you saved us..

1488
01:35:58,908 --> 01:36:00,603
..and didn't Iand us in troubIe.

1489
01:36:00,677 --> 01:36:03,510
But how do you know Johnny BonzeIa?

1490
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:05,907
AII of you considered me useIess.

1491
01:36:05,982 --> 01:36:07,574
And it hurt me deepIy.

1492
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:09,547
It made me furious.

1493
01:36:09,619 --> 01:36:11,678
I feII at Johnny BonzeIa's feet.

1494
01:36:12,088 --> 01:36:13,555
'Okay.'

1495
01:36:13,623 --> 01:36:16,786
And I said Just say hi,
heIIo, chow in front of them.

1496
01:36:17,093 --> 01:36:19,584
And after that you
know what happened now.

1497
01:36:19,662 --> 01:36:21,152
Wow, wow, wow!

1498
01:36:21,498 --> 01:36:23,125
Adi, you are so smart.

1499
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:24,860
Mama wiII be so proud of you.

01:36:24,934 --> 01:36:26,162
Thank you, Adi.

1501
01:36:27,504 --> 01:36:30,837
Friends, I have finaIIy

01:37:18,054 --> 01:37:20,989
There's no one Iike you.

1507
01:37:21,658 --> 01:37:23,683

When you hug me.

1509
01:37:26,663 --> 01:37:28,563

My heart goes zoom, zoom.

Why?

1513
01:38:12,041 --> 01:38:15,909

But I feII onIy for you.

1515
01:38:19,716 --> 01:38:23,049

So that the worId can see it.

1517
01:38:26,823 --> 01:38:28,518
When you hug me.

1518
01:38:28,691 --> 01:38:30,454
When you kiss me.

When you hug me. When you kiss me.

01:38:32,795 --> 01:38:34,820
My heart goes zoom, zoom.

1521
01:38:34,897 --> 01:38:35,989
Why?

1522
01:39:14,137 --> 01:39:17,698
I have no regrets
in Iosing my heart.

1523
01:39:18,007 --> 01:39:21,204
Finding you was reaI joy.

1524

..wiII be kept in this
vauIt behind this fish tank.

1535
01:40:18,935 --> 01:40:23,998

1536
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:26,574
..he stiII won't be
abIe to steaI them.

Your 1000 crores wiII

01:40:31,814 --> 01:40:33,611
That was fun, Kabir.

01:41:21,798 --> 01:41:22,856
Tukaram.

1558
01:41:22,932 --> 01:41:25,025
He isn't rich but poor.

1559
01:41:25,501 --> 01:41:28,561
He isn't fair but bIack.

You want to marry a poor bIack man.

1564
01:41:39,749 --> 01:41:42,912
Don't forget,
Kamini was a bar dancer.

1565
01:41:43,019 --> 01:41:46,614
Munni is disgraced
because of you, darIing.

And gait is regaI.

1570

Dodo, Jojo.

1613
01:44:13,703 --> 01:44:15,466
Dodo, Jojo.

1614
01:44:15,705 --> 01:44:17,195
You shouIdn't fight

You are good boys, aren't you?

1616
01:44:19,141 --> 01:44:20,768
Brothers shouIdn't fight.

01:44:20,843 --> 01:44:22,504
Now shake hands.
- Okay.

1618
01:44:22,578 --> 01:44:23,738
Not mine.

1619
01:44:23,813 --> 01:44:24,837
Shake your hands.

01:44:24,914 --> 01:44:26,142
Come on.
- Okay.

1621
01:44:26,215 --> 01:44:28,513
Good boys. Good boys, good boys.

Wow, sir.

Oh no!

You are right, uncIe.

1626
01:44:41,530 --> 01:44:43,691
As brothers we cannot
fight amongst ourseIves.

1627
01:44:43,766 --> 01:44:45,666
But we can fight with you.

1628
01:44:47,870 --> 01:44:50,168
Sir, they are mad.

1629
01:44:50,439 --> 01:44:52,031
PIease handIe them.

1630
01:44:52,842 --> 01:44:54,571
Stop. Stop.

1631
01:44:58,047 --> 01:45:00,106
You shouIdn't raise
your hands on eIders.

1632
01:45:00,683 --> 01:45:02,844
This is my Iast warning.

1633
01:45:06,522 --> 01:45:07,955
WouId you Iike to eat something?

1634
01:45:08,090 --> 01:45:10,524
No, we want to drink.

1635
01:45:13,596 --> 01:45:15,086
MiIk.
- MiIk.

1636
01:45:15,998 --> 01:45:17,556
MiIk.

1637
01:45:22,104 --> 01:45:23,765
Your miIk is very nice.

1638
01:45:24,907 --> 01:45:27,740
See, there's a sIight
probIem in the beginning.

1639
01:45:28,144 --> 01:45:30,135
But this is a chiId's job for me.

1640
01:45:30,212 --> 01:45:33,841
UncIe, uncIe,
shouId I read your paIm.

1641
01:45:33,916 --> 01:45:37,079

01:45:38,754 --> 01:45:39,880
Jojo.

Look at this Iine.

1644
01:45:41,157 --> 01:45:43,785
It says that he is
going to be a pauper.

1645
01:45:43,859 --> 01:45:44,951
A pauper.

1646
01:45:45,428 --> 01:45:48,829
You are going to be ruined.
- What are you saying?

1647
01:45:48,898 --> 01:45:51,560
We wiII have to erase this Iine.

1648
01:45:51,634 --> 01:45:52,896
What is he saying, sir?

1649
01:45:52,935 --> 01:45:54,926
Can anyone ever
erase the Iines? Oh no!

1650
01:45:55,571 --> 01:45:56,663
What the..

1651
01:45:56,739 --> 01:45:57,899
How dare you?

1652
01:45:57,973 --> 01:46:00,567
The younger brother can't do it
before the eIder brother. - Yes.

1653
01:46:01,143 --> 01:46:02,838
Now you do it.

1654
01:46:02,912 --> 01:46:04,470
Why you.. What are you saying?

1655
01:46:04,547 --> 01:46:06,037
Why you..

01:46:06,115 --> 01:46:08,583
You rascaI.

1657
01:46:09,852 --> 01:46:10,910
Sir.
- Yes.

1658
01:46:10,986 --> 01:46:14,945
Let's do it, sir.
- Let's do it today.

1659
01:46:20,496 --> 01:46:21,963
Why the..

1660
01:46:25,468 --> 01:46:26,799
Brother.

Beat them.

1662
01:46:31,574 --> 01:46:34,566
Beat them some more. Beat them.

1663
01:46:34,643 --> 01:46:36,372
Sir, he's saying beat them.

1664
01:46:37,413 --> 01:46:38,675
Sorry, sir.

1665
01:46:39,381 --> 01:46:41,144
Tukya.
- What Tukya?

1666
01:46:41,417 --> 01:46:46,411
Your brother spit on them.
- Not me, they did.

1667
01:46:46,522 --> 01:46:48,786
Instead of tearing
down this difference..

1668
01:46:48,858 --> 01:46:51,554
..you broke their IoveIy hearts.

1669
01:46:51,861 --> 01:46:53,795
Let's go. Come on.

1670
01:46:54,163 --> 01:46:55,630
Tukya, wait.

1671
01:46:56,499 --> 01:46:58,763
Brother, these innocent boys..

1672
01:46:58,834 --> 01:47:00,768
How couId you?
- They aren't innocent..

1673
01:47:01,971 --> 01:47:06,965
Now I disgrace you just as
much as I respect Tukya.

1674
01:47:07,409 --> 01:47:10,776
Enough, now Kiya
goes where Tukya does.

1675
01:47:10,846 --> 01:47:13,781
You mean you wiII
marry this bIack ghost..

1676
01:47:13,849 --> 01:47:15,680
..against brother's permissio''n.

1677
01:47:15,751 --> 01:47:16,775
Yes.
- What?

1678
01:47:16,852 --> 01:47:19,548
Sir, sir, don't murder
her in a fit of rage.

1679
01:47:19,622 --> 01:47:21,954
I wiII kiII..
- Try it.

1680
01:47:22,191 --> 01:47:26,093
Mr. Kabir Naik, you are
not my famiIy anymore.

1681
01:47:28,798 --> 01:47:31,596
We are famiIy. Let's go.

1682
01:47:31,767 --> 01:47:33,530
BIack and white famiIy, sir.

1683
01:47:39,975 --> 01:47:42,466
I pronounce you man and wife.

1684
01:47:42,545 --> 01:47:43,842
You may now kiss the bride.

1685
01:47:43,913 --> 01:47:46,381
Kiss the bride. Kiss the bride.

1686
01:47:46,749 --> 01:47:48,717
Not you two.

1687
01:47:49,652 --> 01:47:52,678
You may now kiss the bride.
- Of course.

1688
01:48:06,769 --> 01:48:09,567

Dodo, Jojo.

1693
01:48:18,881 --> 01:48:22,009
Why are you two
pIaying with the appIe?

1694
01:48:22,184 --> 01:48:25,620
Adam and Eve ate an appIe
before their wedding night.

1695
01:48:25,688 --> 01:48:28,054
That's why we are
pIaying with the appIe..

1696
01:48:28,123 --> 01:48:31,718
..because we want to pIay
wedding night with sister-in-Iaw.

1697
01:48:31,994 --> 01:48:33,086
No, no, Dodo.

1698
01:48:33,128 --> 01:48:36,586
OnIy I can pIay this game
with your sister-in-Iaw.

1699
01:48:36,665 --> 01:48:39,862
You two take your marbIes out.

1700
01:48:39,935 --> 01:48:41,926
Come on, come on.
Get it out, get it out.

1701
01:48:48,077 --> 01:48:50,568
What, man? Who are you?

1702
01:48:50,646 --> 01:48:54,878
Who sent you and for what?

1703
01:48:54,950 --> 01:49:00,718
Why do I teII you that
my name is MiIan Supari.

1704
01:49:00,789 --> 01:49:05,624
The famous super hit-man.

01:49:06,228 --> 01:49:09,755
Yes. And why shouId I teII you..

01:49:15,037 --> 01:49:16,129
Brother.

1708
01:49:16,171 --> 01:49:18,537
Okay, Tukya, get ready.

1709
01:49:18,607 --> 01:49:19,835
Get ready.

1710
01:49:19,909 --> 01:49:21,843
Wait.
- What?

1711
01:49:21,911 --> 01:49:26,678
You wiII have to kiII me
before you kiII my brother. - Okay.

1712
01:49:30,052 --> 01:49:31,952
Oh my, God.

1713
01:49:32,988 --> 01:49:34,580
Dodo.

1714
01:49:35,491 --> 01:49:37,049
Dodo.

1715
01:49:37,526 --> 01:49:38,993
Whose turn is it now?

1716
01:49:39,061 --> 01:49:40,858
You or you?

1717

01:49:58,814 --> 01:50:01,840
You cannot Ieave us

1722
01:50:02,885 --> 01:50:06,981
Kiya, your brother
shot both my brothers.

1723
01:50:07,056 --> 01:50:09,490
Not two, Tukya, three.

1724
01:50:12,528 --> 01:50:14,052
Kiya.
- Tukya.

1725
01:50:14,129 --> 01:50:17,030
Your brother kiIIed me as weII.

1726
01:50:17,566 --> 01:50:22,799
Dodo, Jojo, I am coming.

1727
01:50:24,873 --> 01:50:27,671
Tukya. Tukya.

Avenge my death, Kiya.

1729
01:50:40,756 --> 01:50:44,886
Avenge our death, Kiya.

1730
01:50:48,030 --> 01:50:49,463
Tukya!

1731
01:50:54,837 --> 01:50:56,668
Ghanta Singh.
- Yes.

1732
01:50:56,905 --> 01:50:58,099
What is happening?

1733
01:50:58,874 --> 01:51:01,172
What speII has that
bIack guy cast on Kiya?

1734
01:51:01,510 --> 01:51:03,774
Sir, it must be bIack magic.

1735
01:51:04,680 --> 01:51:05,942
Sorry, sir.

1736
01:51:13,856 --> 01:51:18,452
But, sir, don't drink

1737
01:51:18,861 --> 01:51:20,488
Sorry, sir.

1738
01:51:34,810 --> 01:51:36,141
Sir.

1739
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:40,139
You are a Sardar.

1740
01:51:40,416 --> 01:51:42,850
You are a Sardar.
- Yes, sir.

1741
01:51:43,986 --> 01:51:47,820
That's why your drink is effective.

1742
01:51:47,890 --> 01:51:51,053
Sir, sir, what's wrong?

1743

..but he isn't answering.
Where is he?

1746
01:51:59,201 --> 01:52:01,931
Upstairs, in his room.

1747
01:52:02,171 --> 01:52:03,968
He is on a waterbed.
- Waterbed?

1748
01:52:04,039 --> 01:52:06,007
Yes.

1749
01:52:06,141 --> 01:52:07,665
If I wouId have been in your pIace..

1750
01:52:07,743 --> 01:52:09,438
..then I wouId've
never gone upstairs.

1751
01:52:09,511 --> 01:52:11,445
Fine, I won't go as weII.
- No, no, no.

1752
01:52:11,513 --> 01:52:13,504
I am in my pIace,
you are in your pIace..

1753
01:52:13,582 --> 01:52:15,709
..but sir is in a wrong pIace.

1754
01:52:15,784 --> 01:52:16,944
What?

1755
01:52:26,895 --> 01:52:28,021
Kabir.

1756
01:52:28,831 --> 01:52:30,594
Kabir.

1757
01:52:31,533 --> 01:52:32,966
Oh Jesus, Kamini.

1758
01:52:33,068 --> 01:52:34,899
Save me.

1759
01:52:34,970 --> 01:52:37,029
This is so embarrassing.

1760
01:52:37,806 --> 01:52:39,569
Wait.

1761
01:52:42,611 --> 01:52:43,976
Witch.

1762
01:52:44,913 --> 01:52:47,711
I never imagined

Kamini, I toId you once.

1765
01:52:51,820 --> 01:52:54,015
I didn't do anything with

01:52:54,089 --> 01:52:55,920
And taIk to me with damn respect.

I am the man of this house.

1768
01:52:57,126 --> 01:52:59,151
If you are the man of the house
you wiII do anything you pIease.

1769
01:52:59,561 --> 01:53:00,858
Remember one thing, Kabir.

1780
01:53:27,689 --> 01:53:29,156
No need to hide.

1781
01:53:29,224 --> 01:53:31,749
I have confessed to my husband..

1782
01:53:31,827 --> 01:53:34,853

1783
01:53:35,130 --> 01:53:37,826
And you.. you are my tiger.

1784
01:53:39,902 --> 01:53:43,895
Sister. Not a
confidante or a companion.

1785
01:53:44,706 --> 01:53:47,038
I want to be your partner.

1786

Kamini, brother isn't a cheater.

1792

And he has murdered none

1794
01:54:36,758 --> 01:54:39,386
He aIso kiIIed poor Dodo and Jojo.

How couId you,

Don't you dare give

You tried to pick on my wife.

1810

You forget about that one biIIion.

The stars, sir.

1823
01:55:59,508 --> 01:56:01,942
Sir, emotions went down the drain.

1824
01:56:02,411 --> 01:56:03,878
Let's save the profession now.

01:56:03,945 --> 01:56:05,071
Okay.

02:04:46,067 --> 02:04:47,728
Are us.

1956
02:04:48,870 --> 02:04:53,807
And those who stoIe your money,
pubIic's money..

1957
02:04:54,075 --> 02:04:57,135
..Johnny's money from your casino.

1958
02:04:57,212 --> 02:04:58,804
Are us.

1959
02:05:08,623 --> 02:05:12,616
I don't regret that I was fooIed.

1960
02:05:14,495 --> 02:05:20,900
But I regret that
you fooIs fooIed me.

1961
02:05:21,236 --> 02:05:22,897
I see.

1962
02:05:23,104 --> 02:05:26,505
Now watch as we do
another fooIish thing.

1963
02:05:29,577 --> 02:05:33,035
HeIIo, is this PameIa,
MandeIa, BundeIa.

1964
02:05:33,114 --> 02:05:35,446
No, this is Johnny BonzeIa.
- Yes.

1965
02:05:36,718 --> 02:05:40,586
Johnny BonzeIa, do you
want Kabir dead or aIive?

1966
02:05:40,655 --> 02:05:44,455
I want Kabir aIive so that I
can kiII him. - Yes, come fast.

1967
02:05:45,660 --> 02:05:47,184
I wiII kiII you both.

1968
02:05:50,465 --> 02:05:51,796
What is happening?

1969
02:05:54,202 --> 02:05:56,670
Sir, its action repIay, sir.

1970
02:05:58,940 --> 02:06:00,999
It's the same whiskey, sir,
and the same piII.

1971
02:06:01,142 --> 02:06:02,939
That's the sofa, sir, faII on it.

1972
02:06:04,812 --> 02:06:06,541
I am feeIing so good..

1973
02:06:06,614 --> 02:06:09,674
..after ruining Kamini,
Kiya and this 'GanduI'.

1974
02:06:09,751 --> 02:06:11,218
Yes.

1975
02:06:11,419 --> 02:06:13,751
1000 crores are waiting for us.

1976
02:06:13,821 --> 02:06:16,619
What wiII be my share?
- Shut up, Manav.

1977
02:06:16,758 --> 02:06:18,089
Now we wiII be ahead..

1978
02:06:18,159 --> 02:06:20,218
..and the worId wiII be after us.

1979
02:06:20,428 --> 02:06:23,022
Wow, Adi, you are so smart.

1980
02:06:24,699 --> 02:06:25,893
Adi.

1981
02:06:32,840 --> 02:06:33,898
What is happening?

1982
02:06:33,975 --> 02:06:36,170
Adi, seems Iike they
are showing a fiIm.

1983
02:06:38,713 --> 02:06:42,444
Oh no, that's us.
- Yes.

1984
02:06:48,456 --> 02:06:53,393
And those who stoIe your money,
pubIic's money..

1985
02:06:53,528 --> 02:06:56,725
..Johnny's money from your casino.

1986
02:06:56,798 --> 02:06:58,060
Are us.

1987
02:06:58,132 --> 02:06:59,724
Oh shit.

1988
02:06:59,801 --> 02:07:03,202
RascaI, you definiteIy
forgot to switch off the cameras.

1989
02:07:03,471 --> 02:07:05,063
I switched off the cameras. I swear.

1990
02:07:05,139 --> 02:07:09,405
There are no cameras
here yet someone fiImed us.

1991
02:07:09,477 --> 02:07:12,207
Adi, you are not so smart.
- Shut up.

1992
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:14,607
But who did this?

1993
02:07:23,424 --> 02:07:25,221
Kabir.
- Kamini.

1994
02:07:25,493 --> 02:07:27,825
Kiya.
- These rascaIs did this.

1995
02:07:27,962 --> 02:07:32,490
FooIs, you think you duped us.

1996
02:07:32,967 --> 02:07:37,631
But we.. duped you instead.
- Us?

1997
02:07:41,109 --> 02:07:43,839
Yes. DoubIe DhamaaI.

1998
02:07:44,112 --> 02:07:47,513
That means you three
knew about our pIan.

1999
02:07:47,715 --> 02:07:49,910
Of course, Tukiye.

2000
02:07:50,051 --> 02:07:51,040
What did you think?

2001
02:07:51,119 --> 02:07:53,713
You didn't break the
difference between us..

2002
02:07:53,788 --> 02:07:57,121
..and separated a
brother and sister.

2003
02:08:03,197 --> 02:08:04,664
And, Boman, you.

2004
02:08:06,868 --> 02:08:08,665
This boy's hot.

2005
02:08:08,736 --> 02:08:11,204
Make me your partner.

2006
02:08:17,678 --> 02:08:18,940
And what did you think?

2007
02:08:19,480 --> 02:08:23,610
You can ruin us posing
as Ghanta Singh. - No.

2008
02:08:29,090 --> 02:08:30,614
Good shot, Kabir.

2009
02:08:44,772 --> 02:08:46,831
What?
- BaIIs to me.

2010
02:09:01,989 --> 02:09:04,924
First we duped you of 250 crores.

2011
02:09:05,793 --> 02:09:08,125
And now 1000 crores.

2012
02:09:08,930 --> 02:09:10,454
But just a minute.

2013
02:09:10,865 --> 02:09:13,134
We have those 1000 crores.

2014
02:09:13,134 --> 02:09:16,001
And we wiII never teII you
where we have hidden it.

2015
02:09:16,070 --> 02:09:17,935
What now? What now? What now?

2016
02:09:18,005 --> 02:09:21,202
Who wiII teII us now
where are the 1000 crores.

2017
02:09:21,275 --> 02:09:22,537
I wiII.

2018
02:09:29,217 --> 02:09:30,741
Mausim bhai, you are aIive.

2019
02:09:30,818 --> 02:09:33,810
No matter how iII
one wishes for me..

2020
02:09:33,888 --> 02:09:37,551
..but my fate's aIready
decided by Kabir boss.

2021
02:09:37,692 --> 02:09:39,091
Kabir boss?

2022
02:09:39,227 --> 02:09:42,563
The one that brought
you to India from Macau.

2023
02:09:42,563 --> 02:09:44,087
Are us.

2024
02:09:45,032 --> 02:09:49,093
The one that kept an eye on
your every move, every pIanning.

2025
02:09:49,170 --> 02:09:50,637
Are us.

2026
02:09:51,973 --> 02:09:55,909
The 1000 crores that you
hid in Rodex dockyard.

2027
02:09:57,979 --> 02:10:00,846
The one that transferred it
to Kabir Naik's Swiss account.

2028
02:10:00,915 --> 02:10:01,973
Are us.

2029
02:10:04,919 --> 02:10:06,045
So?

2030
02:10:06,721 --> 02:10:09,246
Surprised, aren't you?

2031
02:10:09,790 --> 02:10:11,121
Traitor.

2032
02:10:11,192 --> 02:10:13,183
You were supporting
them aII the time.

2033
02:10:15,530 --> 02:10:16,929
On that note I remembered.

2034
02:10:17,665 --> 02:10:20,133
When someone's going
through a bad phase.

2035
02:10:20,735 --> 02:10:22,600
He doesn't need a watch.

2036
02:10:22,870 --> 02:10:24,132
Leave the watch, rascaI.

2037
02:10:24,205 --> 02:10:26,264
We have Iost the money,
at Ieast Ieave the watch.

2038
02:10:26,541 --> 02:10:29,066
But, Kabir, why us?

2039
02:10:29,944 --> 02:10:31,673
It was your fauIt.

2040
02:10:32,079 --> 02:10:33,808
I warned you so many times..

2041
02:10:33,881 --> 02:10:35,940
..that don't come to my home,
don't come to my home.

2042
02:10:36,083 --> 02:10:37,550
I wiII make you pay.

2043
02:10:37,618 --> 02:10:38,880
But you..

2044
02:10:38,953 --> 02:10:42,548
Kabir. Kabir. Kabir. Kabir.

2045
02:10:42,890 --> 02:10:44,482
Now you are paying for it.

2046
02:10:44,559 --> 02:10:46,026
First Bata bhai.

2047
02:10:46,093 --> 02:10:49,756
And not Johnny BonzeIa.
- BonzeIa?

2048
02:10:49,897 --> 02:10:54,163
Yes, you invited your own death.

2049
02:10:54,635 --> 02:10:55,966
He must be on his way.

2050
02:10:56,103 --> 02:10:59,561
And after this, we
wiII show him your fiIm..

2051
02:10:59,640 --> 02:11:01,642
..in this red Iounge.

2052
02:11:01,642 --> 02:11:06,045
And then he wiII make
smaII pieces of your body.

2053
02:11:47,088 --> 02:11:48,817
Brother, what's wrong with them?

2054
02:11:49,156 --> 02:11:50,817
When someone's scared..

2055
02:11:51,092 --> 02:11:53,822
..they start
speaking in every Ianguage.

2056
02:11:54,095 --> 02:11:56,086
Isn't it?
- Yes.

2057
02:11:56,564 --> 02:11:58,156
Kabir boss.

2058
02:11:58,232 --> 02:12:00,700
Forgive us.

2059
02:12:01,836 --> 02:12:03,497
Cops and thieves are brothers.

2060
02:12:03,571 --> 02:12:04,765
We were friends.

2061
02:12:04,972 --> 02:12:06,974
We were once partners.

2062
02:12:06,974 --> 02:12:08,965
Fine, I wiII Iet you go.

2063
02:12:10,111 --> 02:12:12,705
I wiII give you one chance to fIee.

2064
02:12:12,980 --> 02:12:15,107
BonzeIa must be on his way.

2065
02:12:15,249 --> 02:12:16,716
And Iisten.

2066
02:12:16,984 --> 02:12:19,919
I have arranged for a
taxi for you outside.

2067
02:12:20,454 --> 02:12:21,648
Get up.

2068
02:12:22,189 --> 02:12:24,589
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

2069
02:12:24,659 --> 02:12:26,126
Thank you.

2070
02:12:26,727 --> 02:12:29,787
Just a minute.
- Yes, Kabir boss.

2071
02:12:30,264 --> 02:12:33,131
Remember one thing
before Iocking horns with me.

2072
02:12:33,868 --> 02:12:39,932
I mastered this Iine, way
before you were born. - Yes, yes.

2073
02:12:50,418 --> 02:12:51,749
Let's go, Iet's go.

2074
02:12:51,819 --> 02:12:53,810
FuII speed, fuII speed.
- Start it. Start it.

2075
02:12:53,888 --> 02:12:56,686
Hey, do I Iook Iike a
C grade movie heroine..

2076
02:12:56,757 --> 02:12:58,156
..who wiII start instantIy.

2077
02:13:00,761 --> 02:13:01,955
Bata bhai.

2078
02:13:02,096 --> 02:13:05,896
You scoundreIs, you are
having a good time in Macau..

2079
02:13:05,966 --> 02:13:07,900
..after duping me of my money.

2080
02:13:07,968 --> 02:13:09,833
No, we didn't dupe
you of your money.

2081
02:13:09,904 --> 02:13:11,496
That rascaI Kabir did.

2082
02:13:11,572 --> 02:13:14,234
Shut up.

2083
02:13:15,176 --> 02:13:18,043
Kabir Naik is God father.

2084
02:13:18,245 --> 02:13:20,110
Like 'Dharmatma' (a Hindi
movie on the Iines of Godfather).

2085
02:13:20,181 --> 02:13:22,046
Like 'Dayawan' (a Hindi
movie on the Iines of Godfather).

2086
02:13:22,850 --> 02:13:25,182
HaiI Kabir.

2087
02:13:27,254 --> 02:13:28,915
Kabir.

2088
02:13:28,989 --> 02:13:30,854
Yes, Kabir.

2089
02:13:30,991 --> 02:13:34,392
I Iost everything
because of the four of you.

2090
02:13:34,462 --> 02:13:37,920
Thanks to this great man
who brought me to Macau..

2091
02:13:38,065 --> 02:13:40,533
..and gave me this
taxi for making a Iiving.

2092
02:13:40,601 --> 02:13:43,126
And today he caIIed on my phone..

2093
02:13:43,204 --> 02:13:45,866
..that, ''There's a
speciaI fare for you''.

2094
02:13:45,940 --> 02:13:48,067
Wow, that's reaIIy fare.

2095
02:13:48,142 --> 02:13:54,206
Now it's DDLJ for you.
- DDLJ?

2096
02:13:54,415 --> 02:13:57,680
I wiII kiII you.

2097
02:13:58,486 --> 02:13:59,817
RascaIs.

2098
02:14:01,222 --> 02:14:03,019
Run, he wiII shoot.

2099
02:14:07,027 --> 02:14:08,221
Johnny.
- BonzeIa.

2100
02:14:08,429 --> 02:14:09,691
Brothers.
- Run.

2101
02:14:11,632 --> 02:14:14,157
You rascaIs, I wiII kiII you.

2102
02:14:14,969 --> 02:14:16,766
Let's get them boys.

2103
02:14:17,171 --> 02:14:19,765
Adi, you were right.

2104
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:22,104
One day the entire worId
wiII be after us. - Quiet.

2105
02:14:22,176 --> 02:14:23,973
That scoundreI ruined us.

2106
02:14:24,044 --> 02:14:27,104
And now we ruin him.

2107
02:14:27,181 --> 02:14:28,978
That rascaI duped us twice.

2108
02:14:29,049 --> 02:14:32,507
Just watch, in the next part
we wiII dupe him three times.

2109
02:14:53,941 --> 02:14:56,535
''Let me teII you that
no one can stop me.''

2110
02:14:56,610 --> 02:14:59,010
''I swear no one can bIock us.''

2111
02:14:59,079 --> 02:15:00,478
''Try to stop me.''

2112
02:15:00,548 --> 02:15:01,674
''And I won't spare you.''

2113
02:15:01,749 --> 02:15:04,081
''The worId wiII be at my feet.''

2114
02:15:04,151 --> 02:15:05,948
''Come girI.''

2115
02:15:06,220 --> 02:15:08,552
''Come girI.''

2116
02:15:09,557 --> 02:15:12,025
''Come my girI, come with me.''

2117
02:15:12,092 --> 02:15:14,617
''Together we are 'doubIe dhamaaI'.''

2118
02:15:14,695 --> 02:15:17,220
''Come my girI, come with me.''

2119
02:15:17,431 --> 02:15:19,763
''Together we are 'doubIe dhamaaI'.''

2120
02:15:51,065 --> 02:15:53,465
''Just pegs and a pub.''

2121
02:15:53,534 --> 02:15:55,934
''And no restrictions at aII.''

2122
02:15:56,203 --> 02:15:58,535
''My darIing shouId
be dancing aIong.''

2123
02:15:58,606 --> 02:16:01,074
''On Punjabi foIk.''

2124
02:16:01,141 --> 02:16:02,472
''Just pegs and a pub.''

2125
02:16:02,543 --> 02:16:03,737

Then she had a slipper in
her hand with his cheek in front.

I went to her house.

You keep your mouth shut.

132
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:30,397
When the squint girl from
the third year swore at you..

133
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,096
..were you revered then?
Weren't you insulted then?

Who? Pammi?
- Yes, her.

What do you see
in that squint girl?

137
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:40,910
Why are you chasing her?

138
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:48,681
One of her eyes is so beautiful
even the other eye looks at it.

139
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,345
You know?

140
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,882
Let's go play cricket.

141
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,922
Cricket?

142
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,791
What cricket? We have
professor Vaswani's class now.

143
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:01,622
If we miss even one class, we
will surely fail at Math this time.

144
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,763
Oh freak, Vaswani!
Someone get him to miss class.

145
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,097
Mark, please do something.

146
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,196
That's right.
- I ow"".

147
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,141
Professor Sneh
ata's protest
can save us from class.

148
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,875
Friends, are you with ma? Come on.

149
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,311
Yes! Yes! Yes!

150
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:22,485
We won't permit the stink from
that toilet to reach our college.

151
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,412
Man, I can't endure this protest.

152
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,259
Look straight ahead, you pumpkin!

153
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,221
The municipality must take action!

154
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:35,131
They must move the toilet from there.
-We look like losers, man!

155
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,859
Everybody pick up the
placards and join the protest.

156
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:44,637
A toilet cannot prevail
where our college exists!

157
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:50,271
A toilet cannot prevail
where our college exists!

158
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:55,045
Hey, let's go!
Come, come, come, come.

159
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,385
C'mon!

160
00:12:56,408 --> 00:13:00,948
A toilet cannot prevail
where our college exists!

161
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,849
They will never mend
their ways, father.

162
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,793
They marked their
attendance in the protest..

163
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,258
..so they could bunk class.

164
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,296
And they disappeared from
the protest within ï¬ve minutes.

165
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,960
I was very tempted to
exposing the four of them.

166
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,768
I remained silent because
he is Meenu's brother.

167
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,269
Cool it, my dear. Cool it.

168
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,443
I don't send you to college""

169
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,571
..so you might get
involved in these muddles.

170
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,309
Keep your mind on your
studies and your grades.

171
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:31,447
In any case it is unbecoming
of girls to deal with louts.

172
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,551
And keep control on your anger.

173
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,290
You are old enough to marry..

174
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,691
..and you're running
around being a do-gooder.

175
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,159
Sons, are the payments
coming on time?

176
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,660
What can I do, father?
A lot of money is tied up.

177
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,431
Nobody makes payments on time.

178
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:49,199
Father, I think if I go to
all the offices and make a noise..

179
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,262
""than perhaps.

180
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:55,344
Look boys,
the payment should come in on time.

181
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,570
You may do what you
please to achieve this.

182
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,908
Io, my boy,
we don't want any ï¬ghts.

183
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,718
We aren't that kind of people.

184
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,917
And what son of a father are you?

185
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,216
You are teaching your
sons the wrong things.

186
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:13,494
Okay Pammi, starting today
you manage our business.

187
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,858
..and we shall manage your kitchen.

188
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,190
Nonsense!

189
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,769
Give me ï¬ve. Give me ï¬ve.

190
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:26,868
Hello sir.

191
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,167
May we enter?

192
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:29,969
Oh no!

193
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:34,609
The veterans of our college,
our stars on earth""

194
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,711
..our backbench scholars
have ï¬nally arrived in college.

195
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,156
Applause.

196
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,749
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, guys.

197
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:42,857
Silence.

198
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,553
Tell me, why have you arrived late?

199
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,329
Come on, sir, how could
we come late for your class? -Yes.

200
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,264
We're here for the next class""
- Vaswani.

201
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,665
We're here early for professor
Vaswani's class. You see?

202
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,135
Silence!

203
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,331
Io point talking to you.

204
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,234
Why don't you just get out!
Get lost!

205
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:00,542
Really?

206
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:08,474
Io, it's correct. Sometimes
one should come late to class.

207
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,645
Good boy! Good boy! Go, sit. Sit.

208
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:11,944
We'll learn.

209
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,579
Sit, sit.
- Come.

210
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,526
All is well. All is well.

211
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,964
Today we shall learn
how to identify a species.

212
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,934
""through the body pans.

213
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,034
Any questions? All clear?

214
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:28,727
Very clear, sir.

215
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,475
You came in only just now
and it's all clear for you. How'?

216
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,340
Yes sir. That's because
you are a great teacher..

217
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,972
..and I am a great student.

218
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,549
Very good, my bright student!

219
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:45,317
Low tell me to which
bird do those legs belong?

220
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,813
That, sir?

221
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,683
I don't know that, sir.

222
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,023
You don't know? I know.

223
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,364
The Principal will
answer your question.

224
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,432
The bell has rung.

225
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,861
Anyway, I'll leave now.
I'll deal with you later.

226
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:00,435
I will ï¬x them.

227
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,400
The rascal regards
himself a good actor.

228
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,270
Vaswani.

229
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,142
These students are very naughty.

230
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,171
Teach them a lesson?

231
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,551
You four! Get up.

232
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,413
Low get out.

233
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,257
He's teaching them
a lesson upon arrival.

234
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:28,931
Despite the last warning
you missed the last class. Out!

235
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,828
But for a good cause, sir.

236
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,668
Ma'am Sneh
ata's toilet protest.

237
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:39,536
Oh, the toilet protest!
Sit down, sit down.

238
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:44,503
So class,
every student has a dream.

239
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:48,082
Your brother Veer and his
friends will come to naught.

240
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,576
Why don't you speak to Veer?

241
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,581
What do I say to him?

242
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,616
We are twins but our
minds are very diverse.

243
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:59,289
And in any case,
when father has given up on him..

244
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,762
..what could I possibly do?

245
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,955
lever mind.
They will come to naught.

246
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,369
Mark, come here, boy.
Dinner's on the table.

247
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,929
Come to the chair quickly.

248
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,308
Mark!

249
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,335
Mario!

250
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:23,619
Mark, Don't thank this
father if you don't want to..

251
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:27,151
..but at least thank god,
the father before you eat.

252
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,459
Oh god, pop! Give me a break.

253
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,519
Thank you, god,
for giving us this lovely meal"".

254
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,959
..and for the good
appetite to eat it.

255
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,189
Learn from your brother.

256
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,301
Very good boy, Mario! Very nice!

257
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,871
Very good boy, Mario!
Very good! Idiot!

258
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:49,611
What's the matter, pop?
The food is delicious today.

259
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:56,581
If you must praise someone,
praise your mummy.

260
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,049
She taught me to cook this food.

261
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,887
Had she been alive today,
you know how pleased she'd be?

262
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,756
Oh god! Stop it, pop.

263
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,729
Why do you get so sentimental
every two minutes?

264
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,463
So Mario, did you tell pop..

265
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,195
..how much you scored
in the math exam?

266
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,699
Shut up, Mark!

267
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,829
How much did you score?

268
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,603
I'll tell. The math
paper is one hundred marks.

269
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,811
He didn't understand questions
amounting to twenty marks.

270
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,842
He didn't see questions
amounting to thirty marks..

271
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,707
..and he didn't know the answers.

272
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,148
..to questions amounting
to ï¬fty marks.

273
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,443
What does that leave, Mario?

274
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,286
You see this egg.
This is left. Eat it.

275
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:33,254
I'll hit you.

276
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,723
Mark, stop hitting him!

277
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:38,392
And Mario,
why do I send you to school?

278
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,121
To study, not to lay eggs.

279
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,154
Very bad! Very bad!

280
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,327
In any case, this is my problem.

281
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,531
""because if you're
mother had been alive""

282
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,368
""would he go lay eggs in school.

283
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:53,171
0h gosh!

284
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,109
Oh god, please stop it, pop.

285
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,846
Even the two of us miss mama..

286
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,412
..but to get so sentimental
every two minutes.

287
00:18:58,504 --> 00:18:59,505
Grow up, man!

288
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,006
H ey!

289
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,781
Don't be too smart.
Don't try to be my father.

290
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:04,943
Eat quietly.

291
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,919
This duffer Mario started this.

292
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,590
You called me duffer?
- Yes.

293
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,555
ll ow you will suffer.
- Really?

294
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,823
Dad broke your ugly glass pad.

295
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:17,496
What?! That was my
favourite piece. Oh you!

296
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,542
Mark! Mark!

297
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,607
Mark! Come on, man!

298
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,709
Come on out. Where are you?

299
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:33,906
Mark!

300
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,583
Why are you howling? You
want to give the dogs a complex.

301
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:40,646
Where are you?

302
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:41,747
Over here.

303
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,554
Mark, give me ï¬ve hundred rupees.

304
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,320
Why?

305
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,193
I was returning from Juhu
and met her on the street.

306
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,257
She kissed me all the way here.

307
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,259
She's so beautiful!

308
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:54,532
What are you saying, man?

309
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,268
If you see her you'll tell
me to give her one thousand.

310
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,967
Honey, you're coming or..

311
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,514

You are jealous of me.

323
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,017
That's why you're calling
my fair lady a man.

Sorry ma'am. They don't know
a good thing when they see it.

Why do you go out when
you can't see at night?

349
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,119
What can I do?
- Forget it.

350

Let's have a drink. Come.

Mark.
- Yes.

You rescued me once again.
You are very cool.

Why do you tease him so?

357
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:19,539
He is very simple.

358
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,615
If I don't tease him today""

359
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:26,879

tease him in future.

You are right, Marky.

361
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:34,219
I'd like to tell you something
from the heart today.

When all the pages
of my life are over""

page where I met you, Marky.

front of seem like four to me.

Then you're deï¬nitely drunk.

371
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,055
Because there's only
one tree in front.

372
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:08,196
What? They chop so many trees.

373
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:09,627
They chop so many trees.

374
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,457
There were so many trees here.

Forget him.

383
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,276
I'll be back right away.

384

I have a major problem, Mark.

437
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:07,162
I knew no answers in today's
test so I left the paper blank.

438
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:09,196
Even Bablu left the paper blank.

439

Yes, so what?

440
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:12,902

Silly boy!

445
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,747
That reminds me.

446
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:25,279
Why did Soniyo let
you copy from her?

447
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,716
Yes.
- What's going on?

448
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,993
I don't like to kiss and tell.
- Indeed.

449
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:33,028
You guys know all the
girls are crazy about me.

450
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,996
All of them do
things to impress me.

451
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,896
Forget it. I can't tell
you everything about all.

452
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:42,230
Oh, really?

453
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,366
I was referring to other girls.

454
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,171
I see.
- Obviously not you.

455
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,042
Lot you, obviously. Io..

456
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:54,509
You really hurt me.
- Soniyo!

457
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,718
Shit! Are you pleased now?

458
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,885
I too will have to
leave the next paper blank.

459
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,682
And Vaswani will think the
three of copied from each other.

460
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:04,582
Idiots!

461
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,592

What can I do?

465
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,201
Why are you stressing over this?

..to play badminton with Meenu.

468

You meet her there
and apologize to her.

469
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:25,603
That's all.

470
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,768
Who's looking for trouble?

471
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:57,702
Who is it?

00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:58,235
Io, my boy, she ran away
with Salman Khan this morning.

490
00:29:58,263 --> 00:29:59,264
What?

491
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:03,810
You ass! Where will your aunty go?

492
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:05,408
She must be at home.

493
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,347
Low tell me, are you here
to see aunty or to see Veer?

494
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,548
If you're hereto see Veer""

495
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,950
..you have no chance
of doing so until noon.

496
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:18,825
When you didn't call out to him,
""Oh Veeru!"" I guessed.

497
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:21,195
I'll go see aunty.

498
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,960
Talk to me ï¬rst, boy.

499
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,055
Okay, uncle.

500
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:29,671
Low tell me, do Veer and
you intend to pass this year?

501
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,967
We sure intend to do so but
I don't know about the teacher.

502
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:33,068
What do you mean?

503
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:35,373
Read the paper.
Lose weight now, ask me how.

504
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,002
Page sixteen.
Read it, read it, read it.

505
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,514
Lose weight now, ask me how.

506
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,241
Yeah!

507
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,342
Punjabi!

508
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,586
Punjabi!

509
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,089
Hi aunty.

510
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:51,417
You're up early, son?
Veer is still..

511
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:52,761
I know, I know, I know.

512
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:53,785
Okay sit.

513
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,330
What are you looking for?

514
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,599
Nothing. I wanted some fresh air.

515
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,168
We are preparing
mango pickle. - Yes.

516
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:11,774
Why don't you taste some
pickle with your fresh air.

517
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:12,904
Cool!

518
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:15,910
Oh, hi Meenu. How are you?

519
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:20,920
Aunty, what do you put in this?

520
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:24,784
Son, obviously a mango
pickle will have mangoes, my boy.

521
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:25,886
Oh yeah. Right.

522
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,529
Incidentally even my
mom used to prepare pickles.

523
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:30,655
Fish pickle. With ï¬sh.

524
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:31,563
Fish?

525
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,091
Yes. It's very famous in Goa.

526
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:34,965
Although even this is very yummy.

527
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:38,233
So take some with you.
Mario can have some.

528
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,001
<i>0K3â!-</i>

529
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:42,067

Meenu, today is Sunday.

Her partner hasn't come today.

532
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,282
Where is Soniyo?

533
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:54,980
One of her cousin's
is getting married.

534
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,888
She must be busy with
the wedding procession.

535
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:58,759
Low way she's coming today.

536
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,161
Thanks.

537
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:02,787
For the pickle.

538
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,492
The pickle.

539
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,267
Since there's no chance
of seeing Veer before noon..

540
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,039
..
'

541
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:14,474
I just wanted to tell him,
at lake view this evening, okay.

542
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:15,733
Bye.

543
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,409
Stop it, stop it.

544
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:22,707
It's going in my eyes.

545
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,646
Mark, tell me something.

546
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:28,924
Yes.

547
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,756
Why did you come to
my house early this morning?

548
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,323
Morning walk.

549
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:34,696
At my house?

550
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,255
Yes, I was passing from there..

551
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,229
..so I thought
of passing some time.

552
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,731
Passing time at my house?

553
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,072
Am I in such dire straits?
- Damn you!

554
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,571
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

555
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:56,345
It's evening and it's
getting cold over here.

556
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:57,684
Let's go.

557
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,153
Oh really! Silly aunty.

558
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:03,085
Pop must be waiting
up for me for dinner, boys.

559
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:04,950
And Mario must be starving.

560
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:06,695
I'm leaving. Bye.

561
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:12,400
Meet us at night after dinner.

562
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,424
Yes, okay, okay.

563
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,228
Mark! What is he doing here?

564
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,167
What's the matter, boy? Come.

565
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,298
Thanks, brother.
- What happened, son?

566
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,009
I love wedding processions.

567
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,807
Come join the procession.

568
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,165
I'll be back right away, brother.

569
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:20,892
Soniya.
- Yes.

570
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:25,105
Actually I came to apologize.

571
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,778
You came up all
the way here for this?

572
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:33,581
Obviously.
I don't know to dance that dance.

573
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,849
You might as well learn
now that you're here.

574
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,910
Just do this.

575
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:55,735
Your belt is open and
your trouser has dropped down.

576
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,211
Why are your briefs wet?

577
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:08,339
Oh!

578
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,774
What's the matter, son?

579
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,275
Strange thing.

580
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:14,589
Go change your trousers
if you want to.

581
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,950
Strange man!

582
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,759
And you should have
seen his face then.

583
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,119
Really?

584
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,356
Oh my god! That was so funny.

585
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,627
If that wasn't all
our Bunty questioned him.

586
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:26,962
Why are your briefs wet?

587
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,268
Do you have a second?
- What?

588
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:33,998
<i>Msâ.</i>

589
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,236
Kiss?!
- lot kiss.

590
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,801
Tale, tale.

591
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:41,215
The tale about the wet briefs
and trousers dropping down.

592
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,815
Please don't tell anyone or..

593
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,649
I know. Or what?

594
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,958
What are you discussing
on the street?

595
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:52,390
Shut up! I just felt like"".

596
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,823
Felt like?
You feel like anything at any time.

597
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:57,989
Damn you!

598
00:35:58,356 --> 00:35:59,391
Let's go, let's go!

599
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:00,468
I'm going.

600
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,133
You hear that, Meenu?

601
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:06,742
He feels like doing
anything any time.

602
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:09,137
Yes right.

603
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,511
We must win this time.
- Come on, man! I will do it.

604
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:14,242
Bablu, will you give
an exam in ï¬reworks?

605
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:15,314
Fireworks?

606
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,682
It is the festival of lights today,
isn't it?

607
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:17,817
Today?

608
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:18,616
Io.

609
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,418
Then why is he glowing
like a lantern?

610
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,950
Festival of lights,
lantern, ï¬reworks.

611
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,958
I'll light ï¬reworks
under you guys.

612
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,958
I told you today is my
sister Meenu's engagement.

613
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:32,228
Oh no!

614
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,835
How could all of you forget?

615
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,238
Bablu! Whose engagement is it?

616
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,103
Meenu's. Who is Meenu's brother?

617
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:38,932
You.
- Yes.

618
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:41,000
So you go. Who's stopping you?

619
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:42,934
What will we do there?

620
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,540
In any case our pool competition
is today. - Yes.

621
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,379
In any case, we will lose
face if we don't go there.

622
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:48,042
Yes.

623
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:49,813
This concerns our reputation.
We have to go.

624
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,841
Yes, right. Come, come.

625
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:54,555
Headlight! Come on, Bablu.

626
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,421
Oh no. He's shouting.
- We have our game.

627
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,928
Does the pool game mean more to you
than my sister's engagement?

628
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:01,052
Headlight! Bab
u..

629
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:03,326
Stop, stop. Come out!
What are you doing?

630
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,163
Didn't I tell you Mark would yell?

631
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,792
Headlight,
we have to go to the engagement.

632
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:08,859
Huh?

633
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,704
But the pool. Our reputation?

634
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:14,239
Pool. Go drown in your pool.

635
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,310
Does our reputation
mean more to us..

636
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,878
""than Meenu's engagement?

637
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:18,876
Nonsense!

638
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,415
But you..
- Yes.

639
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:22,212
I was kidding.

640
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,720
There will be many
more pool competitions.

641
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,682
""but our one and only
Veer's one and only Meenu's..

642
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:30,516
..one and only engagement
is only once in a lifetime.

643
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,156
So drop all this and let's go.

644
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:34,059
My buddy! Thank you, Mark!

645
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,330
You're my only true friend.
- Yes.

646
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:38,130
Let's go, you scoundrels!

647
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:39,361
Let's go, you scoundrels!

648
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,534
Come along.
- Coming.

649
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:54,411
So it's a done deal?
- Of course it's a done deal!

650
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:55,742
wow,

651
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,644
Congratulations!

652
00:37:57,908 --> 00:37:58,943
Congratulations!

653
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,680
Congratulations!

654
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:01,879
Keep away evil eyes on you.

655
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:03,983
Congratulations!
- Thank you.

656
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,705
You? What is it?

657
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,268
The food is ready, Veer's friends.

658
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,109
Let's go eat.

659
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,113
Mark, got your plan man.

660
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:28,042
That means game out.
And eat till we drop.

661
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:30,143
Yes. You guys go and
I'll answer nature's call.

662
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,211
Hello, aunty.

663
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:36,447
Yes coming.

664
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,053
Soniyo looks pretty, doesn't she?

665
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,862
Yes. Her name beï¬ts her qualities.

666
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,530
Why don't we make
her our daughter-in-law?

667
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:51,100
Wonderful! You need to ask.

668
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:52,229
Let go.

669
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:58,636
Thanks.

670
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:00,678
What for?

671
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:04,710
For not telling anyone
the story of my trousers.

672
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:06,480
Oh!

673
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,521
This is Mark.

674
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,690
Mark,
- Greetings, aunty.

675
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:21,329
Meenu and Soniyo told
us the story of your trousers.

676
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,731
So this is brief boy.

677
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:26,900
So sweet!

678
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:29,843
He's such a nice boy.

679
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,275
You are too much.

680
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:45,082
You know what?

681
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:49,096
My parents are making
plans for my marriage.

682
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,492
What are you saying?

683
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:51,589
Really?
- What?

684
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,767
Really? Wow!

685
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:55,693
With whom?

686
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,228
With Soniyo.

687
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:58,133
Soniyo?

688
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:01,735
But it doesn't matter to me.
I just don't want to get on a mare.

689
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:03,534
What rubbish!

690
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:07,782
He's right. He's only a kid.

691
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:09,108
Sure, he's a kid.

692
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,881
We're here if he's
made to saddle a horse.

693
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,487
We'll bring him down in a snap.

694
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,753
Don't stress.

695
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:17,450
Who's providing for ma?
My father or you?

696
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:21,194
But Soniyo and you?

697
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,121
I mean, isn't it weird?

698
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:26,362
Why? After all she's a Punjabi.

699
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,528
And our fathers are friends.

700
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,002
She doesn't seem to be your type.

701
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,063
Why?

702
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,370
She's a girl, isn't she?

703
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,537
And if she were
a little more nasty..

704
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,407
..then she would be my type.

705
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:42,779
Amazing!
- Hey""

706
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:46,414
Look at that girl.
She's just my type.

707
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,719
What a sexy babe, man!

708
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:01,363
So go. Go sweet talk her.

709
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:03,729
Who wants to talk?

710
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:08,269
Just one dance and she'll
come home with me, get it.

711
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:12,443
Of course she'll follow you home.
She is your sister.

712
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:13,537
What?!

713
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,884
She's your sister Tara, you rascal!

714
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:22,781
Do something about this, Mark.

715
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:23,951
Yes, I will. I will.

716
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,324
Oh please.

717
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:30,357
And for a friend here,

720
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,100
Excellent! That was awesome!

721
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,937
Sir, these people are here
to audition as my dance partner.

722

Oh no!

He's here too.

""Dance to the music.

731
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:06,560
Rope bomb and atom bomb together.

""Look at the belly. Oh, so silly.""

733
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,561

""Chug, chug, train. Boys coming
Beep, beep, beep.""

Oh no!
- Yeah.

Who said that?

00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:49,579
Yeah!

847
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:53,016
Yeah!

848
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,056
Brother!

849
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:04,594
Soniyo.

850
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:05,936
What? Tell me.

851
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:08,600
Brother Vikram. He's come
home today for the holidays.

852
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:09,733
Come. Come quick.

853
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:13,043
Brother!

854
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,674
My Minnie mouse!

855
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,317
So how is my Soniyo?

856
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:21,255
When she was little and
her dolls got misplaced"".

857
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:22,416
...I was always searched.

858
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:25,250
Because they were found
with you four out of ten times.

859
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:30,021
So I'm back. I'll bring
you as many dolls as you like.

860
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,926
So girls, what's the plan?
Where are we going?

861
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,093
What are we doing?

862
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,564
Let's go for lunch, brother.

863
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,733
Lunch? How much will you eat,
Minnie mouse?

864
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:43,101
Let's go have some fun.
Come on. Get in.

865
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:49,976
H ey!

866
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:51,007
Get in.

867
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:01,458
Me"" and Soniyo?

868
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:05,689
Nah!

869
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,965
Where you going, you imp?

870
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:16,777
And what is this?

871
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,972
Pasta vindaloo.

872
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:18,938
What?

873
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:23,076
I tried something innovative
with a fusion of Italian and Goan.

874
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:27,513
I see. And for whom are you
taking this fusion in confusion?

875
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:29,412
Suzie.

876
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,252
You haven't lost your
milk teeth as yet, you imp..

877
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,251
..and you already
have a girlfriend.

878
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:37,931
Suzie is pop's age.
She runs a cooking class.

879
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:41,193
But it's time for your
football now, isn't it?

880
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:44,062
Only fat bullies come to football.

881
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:48,004
They play less and
bother kids like me more.

882
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:49,403
What are you saying, Mario?

883
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:50,945
ls that why you bunk classes?

884
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,149
You take it in your stride
when I tease you at home.

885
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:56,715
So why are you afraid
of a handful of stooges?

886
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:59,913
I learn to survive
bullying from you at home""

887
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:01,750
..so why should I waste
my money over there?

888
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:02,856
I see.

889
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:05,723
So you pay your football
fees to cooking aunty?

890
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:09,022
Very smart, little rascal!
Does pop know?

891
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:12,790
Oh no! You topped at football,
you topped at karate.

892
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:15,160
<i>As it is pop considers me</i> a <i>sissy.</i>

893
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:18,406
Oh Mario,
do you know how mature you are?

894
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:21,837
And so responsible too.
Just like our mama.

895
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,611
You are my little man,
Mario Braganza.

896
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:27,244
We are a family that
cares for each other.

897
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:30,581
We love each other.
We conï¬de in each other.

898
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,184
The truth, fast, fast, okay?

899
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,988
So.
- Really I should tell pop?

900
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,482
Yes, really.

901
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:42,719
Really?

902
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:44,354
Come here.

903
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:47,730
Okay, I gotta go now. Bye.

904
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,603
He kissed ma?!

905
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:53,572
Junior fell! Junior fell, uncle!

906
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,267
Junior fell!
Junior fell! Uncle, uncle""

907
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:58,677
Whose junior fell?
- I'll go fetch water.

908
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:02,109
Mario. Mario.

909
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:06,950
Actually this is my fault.

910
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:10,282
Because would you faint this
way if your mother were alive?

911
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:11,357
Uncle, uncle.

912
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:12,860
Tend to junior.
- Quiet!

913
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:14,017
lam tending to him.

914
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:15,252
""Tend to junior.""

915
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:19,791
Are you alright, Mario?
Are you okay?

916
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:20,563
Yes.

917
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,433
He's okay. My son is okay.

918
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:27,375
Mr car? Mr car?

919
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,608
Who cleaned my car?

920
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:30,767
Mark.

921
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:33,136
Mark?

922
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,979
Oh mother Mary!

923
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:39,683
What happened to uncle?

924
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,752
It happens. It happens.

925
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:43,084
Sprinkle water on him.
Sprinkle water.

926
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,897
'I have to tell
Soniyo my feelings.'

927
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:56,493
'How I feel.'

928
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,969
'Before army return Vikram battle.'

929
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:04,172
'Love you Soniyo. What say you?'

930
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:06,936
H ey Mark!
Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark!

931
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,050
Can't you see in the day now,
headlight?

932
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,846
Mark, I was coming
to you only, buddy.

933
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,885
Very important stuff, buddy.

934
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:13,943
What now?

935
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:19,216
I convinced Julie today
to go for a romantic evening.

936
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:22,189
Sunset time.
On the rocks. Lovers point.

937
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:24,456
So what do you want from ma?
You want the three of us to go?

938
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:28,033
Io. Come pick me up after sunset.

939
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,035
You know at sundown I..

940
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:31,662
I know.
- Yes.

941
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:33,229
I'll come.

942
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:34,971
You will come, won't you?
- Yes, I'll come. -Sure?

943
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:35,769
You..!

944
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:36,800
Friends?
- Friends.

945
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:38,274
Thanks. See ya.
- Yes.

946
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:16,641
Vikram's so cute, na?
Cute, na? Cute, na?

947
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:18,475
Idiot! Stupid Vikram!

948
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:20,044
Idiot Vikram! Take this, Vikram!

949
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:22,245
Mark!

950
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:25,315
Mark!

951
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:26,392
Oh shit!

952
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:27,793
Come on out, scoundrel!

953
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:30,520
Come out!

954
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:32,860
A blemish on friendship!

955
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:34,026
Why are you yelling?

956
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:36,403
Why didn't you come to pick me up?

957
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:39,899
Oh my.. Shit! It slipped my mind.

958
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:40,532
Sorry.

959
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:41,940
It slipped your mind?

960
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:45,240
Watch what else I
make you slip on now.

961
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:47,704
What are you doing?

962
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:50,573
Careful.

963
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:52,942
What is this?

964
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:55,217
That scared you, didn't it?

965
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:58,483
I wouldn't be here if I was scared.

966
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:02,262
Where are you?

967
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:03,923
Stand in one place.
I want to hit you.

968
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:05,931
Headlight!
Hold the scoundrel!

969
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:06,931
Headlight!

970
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:07,866
Hold it, hold it!

971
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,096
Are you going to kill him?

972
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:11,865
Hold it, hold it.
- Let it go!

973
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:15,171
Low look, I'm really sorry, man.

974
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:18,175
Shut up, man! Do you
know how much I was insulted?

975
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:21,345
Julie slapped me red.
One the cheeks.

976
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:25,185
Then the police slapped me red.
All over, man.

977
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:26,687
Nothing is over.

978
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:28,580
I was beaten all over.

979
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,425
Sorry. Let it go now.

980
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:33,386
Veer has invited us to a party.

981
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:37,564
Many beautiful babes will attend.

982
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:41,127
Even an aunty will do.
I can't see anyway.

983
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:43,760
But let me know if
anyone ï¬irts with me.

984
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,539
For sure. Come.
- Come.

985
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:46,629
Let's go.

986
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:54,539
""Whoa, my darling.
You are my wine.""

987
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:56,244
""You are divine.""

988
00:57:56,339 --> 00:58:00,014
Yes, Marky goes anywhere
he gets free food.

989
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:00,950
Yes.

990
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,581
""Pretty baby, will you love ma?""

991
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,622
Exactly who is being watched?

992
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:09,494
The glass in your hand
or the alcohol inside.""

993
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,866
Or the one standing next to..

994
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:14,327
Standing? Who is it?

995
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:15,162
Who is standing?

996
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:17,171
Nobody. Mark is drunk.

997
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:18,337
I see.

998
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:19,362
Take a sip.

999
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:22,070
Break your silence and
tell me what you thinking.

1000
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:23,099
That's right, buddy.

1001
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:28,410
Actually I was thinking
this music is very boring.

1002
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:29,741
That's right.

1003
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:30,974
Veer, come here!

1004
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:33,643
Come.

1005
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:34,947
What's the matter?
- Bro.

1006
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:36,582
Please don't mind..
- What?

1007
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,860
""but what son of music
are you playing at the party?

1008
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:41,224
That's right.
- Let's have some peppy music.

1009
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,193
That's right.

1010
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:43,458
So why don't you sing?

1011
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,698
You want me to sing?

1012
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:47,224
Why not? I'll sing.
- Good idea. -Yes.

1013
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:48,702
You're going to sing a song, Marky?

1014
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:50,466
Yes, I'll sing.
- You are my buddy!

1015
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:53,464
Look, Vikram is over there.
Let me introduce you.

1016
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,041
Let's go meet him.
- Yes, let's go. Come, come, come.

1017
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:57,873
Oh no.
- That is all.

1018
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:00,742
Brother, these are my
good friends from childhood.

1019
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:03,578
Mark, Bablu, headlight.
Do you remember?

1020
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,048
Of course, I remember. Hello.

1021
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:06,276
How are you gulls?

1022
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:09,116
Thank god you guys are out
of your shorts and in trousers.

1023
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:12,220
I hope you guys are having fun.
- Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

1024
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,390
My friends are complaining
this is very boring music.

1025
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:19,859
They wish to sing a song
that would get the party going.

1026
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:22,194
Fantastic! Thank god!

1027
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,068
Even I was bloody getting
bored of this music.

1028
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:26,200
Hold on. Ladies and gentlemen.

1029
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:29,867
And now presenting some new
entertainment for this evening.

1030
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:32,912
Mark Braganza and
the childhood buddies.

1031
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:35,371
Thank you. Thank you.

1032
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:37,808
Let's go have a peg. Come.

1033
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:39,749
Oh sure. Why not?
- Thanks.

1034
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:55,101
""Your love blended with me.""

1035
00:59:57,126 --> 01:00:03,566
""Surviving without you gets
tougher with each passing day.""

1036
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:09,045
""I don't know how
love came on my heart.""

1037
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:12,942
""I don't know how
it landed so softly.""

1038
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:22,322
""Neither you nor I know how
it made a niche in our hearts.""

1039
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:44,040
""Just got the feeling
that you just can't say no.""

1040
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:47,978
""Thought about it claps no more.""

1041
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:53,023
""We'll be the next to see,
this is reality.""

1042
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:56,530
""Feel like I'm dreaming""

1043
01:00:56,586 --> 01:01:04,471
""Love was the only
thing she heard aloud.""

1044
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:13,238
""And I believed what people said.""

1045
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:21,813
""I learnt the existence
of love after meeting you.""

1046
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:30,491
""I'd heard and seen
every form of love.""

1047
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:37,567
""I ow my heart is
completely besotted.""

1048
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:19,742
""if you say yes,
it would clinch the deal.""

1049
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:28,147
""Life would be wonderful
if I had your hand.""

1050
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:36,827
""You appear the nicest
and most honest to me.""

1051
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:45,167
""You are close to me
even when you aren't around.""

1052
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:52,575
""I ow my heart is
completely besotted.""

1053
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:14,091
""Just got the feeling
that you just can't say no.""

1054
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:18,132
""Thought about it claps no more.""

1055
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:21,136
Meenu said your engagement
will be discussed today.

1056
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:22,632
Good thing.

1057
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:24,869
Quick engagement
and quick nuptials.

1058
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,180
You'll have it made.

1059
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:31,110
Vikram is a very smart guy.

1060
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,557
What's the matter, Soniyo?
- Huh?

1061
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:40,089
You don't seem happy?

1062
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:43,292
l? Nothing is the matter to ma?
I'm good.

1063
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:46,429
You liar! Your face is pale.

1064
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:47,994
What's the matter?

1065
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:55,467
Tell me the truth.
Do you or don't you like Vikram?

1066
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,405
It's not that.

1067
01:03:57,767 --> 01:03:59,713
Just that everything
is moving so fast.

1068
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:01,381
...I haven't had the time to think.

1069
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:06,383
Why don't you tell
that to your father?

1070
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,113
He wouldn't understand.

1071
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:09,879
He will.

1072
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:13,483
He will surely understand, Soniyo.
Speak to him.

1073
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:16,090
You could ask him for
a little time if nothing more.

1074
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:17,687
To think.

1075
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,396
I don't know why I am confused.

1076
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:26,629
Get go!

1077
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:27,830
He's crazy.

1078
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:31,968
Soniyo.

1079
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:34,303
What?

1080
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:39,244
I'll be back in ajiffy.

1081
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:42,619
Soniyo, you're sitting here.
- Yes.

1082
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:44,356
Everyone is waiting
for you upstairs.

1083
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,321
Come along. Come with me.
- Yes.

1084
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:04,308
Friends, there are two
reasons for today's celebration.

1085
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:09,075
The ï¬rst reason,
my son Vikram has returned""

1086
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:11,448
..from the army as a captain.

1087
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:15,279
And the second and
more important reason""

1088
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:18,391
...I am getting my
son Vikram engaged..

1089
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:22,253
..to my friend Tejinder
Singh's daughter Soniyo.

1090
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:23,319
Papal

1091
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:27,427
Our friendship will turn
into a relationship from now on.

1092
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:30,298
Hold on, Bali,
let me speak as well, buddy?

1093
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:33,740
Listen to me, dad.
- Just a minute, my dear.

1094
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:35,504
Friends""

1095
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:37,908
I have to discuss very important with dad.
-The function we will host next..

1096
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:40,811
Listen, what your dad has to say.
- ""will be grander than this.

1097
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:44,110
Because very soon

holy matrimony with Vikram.

ll-

1103
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:47,407
Mark, what are you doing here?

1104
01:06:47,669 --> 01:06:48,773
I want to talk to you.

1105
01:06:48,836 --> 01:06:49,837

1106
01:06:50,305 --> 01:06:51,249

What do you mean?

1113
01:07:05,453 --> 01:07:06,830
Do you love Vikram?

1114
01:07:09,223 --> 01:07:09,928
It's different.

1115
01:07:09,958 --> 01:07:11,494
Soniyo, Do you know him?

1116
01:07:13,261 --> 01:07:15,207
I love you, I love you.

1117
01:07:18,766 --> 01:07:23,112
College's dance rehearsals, connection
between you and me, I mean..

I don't know what is love.

You don't like ma?

1123
01:07:41,055 --> 01:07:43,865
Of course I like you,
but just like a friend.

1124
01:07:44,592 --> 01:07:47,368
And Vikram is better
because he is Punjabi, right?

1125
01:07:47,895 --> 01:07:54,278
Io, because he is my dad's
choice and I am ok with him.

1126
01:07:54,602 --> 01:07:56,843
Because I am a very simple girl..

1127
01:07:57,238 --> 01:08:01,015
..and I want my life
simple and no complications.

1128
01:08:03,044 --> 01:08:04,022

A phone call.

1388
01:24:57,658 --> 01:24:58,728
Hello?

1389
01:25:02,629 --> 01:25:03,630

You are telling me this now?

1392
01:25:10,904 --> 01:25:13,441
Isn't there anything
like responsibility?

1393
01:25:14,675 --> 01:25:16,882
You denied the children
to carry the mobile with them.

1394
01:25:18,045 --> 01:25:19,319
What no network zone?

1395
01:25:23,784 --> 01:25:24,785

1396
01:25:28,422 --> 01:25:29,457

1402
01:25:48,975 --> 01:25:51,012
Hello, hello?

Disconnected,

01:25:55,282 --> 01:25:56,283
Who's money ï¬nished?

1405
01:25:56,450 --> 01:25:58,452

Where is Soniyo?

1407
01:26:00,554 --> 01:26:04,559
I don't know,
she said Mark is with him.

1408
01:26:05,325 --> 01:26:06,963
It's possible that
they may be together""

- Yes.

1411
01:26:11,498 --> 01:26:14,945
It's good that she is not alone,
that she is with Mark.

1412
01:26:15,268 --> 01:26:17,043
God help them.

1413
01:26:22,809 --> 01:26:30,125
""I don't know how does
love touched my heart.""

1414
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:36,064
""Don't know how love stepped
lightly on the earth of my heart""

1415
01:26:37,691 --> 01:26:43,733
""it has made a home
in our heart in such a way.""

1416
01:26:44,931 --> 01:26:49,971
""That neither of us got to know.""

1417
01:27:04,718 --> 01:27:06,220
Cake cut is happening.

Everybody in the
camp must be worried.

1428
01:28:30,770 --> 01:28:35,549
Don't worry Soniyo, there is no network
in camp so don't have tension.

""than abstract glass is produced.

1480
01:31:35,255 --> 01:31:36,962

This lightening, which makes
beautiful glasses, killed my mom.

01:32:26,739 --> 01:32:28,946
Mark, I am so sorry.

1491
01:32:31,077 --> 01:32:35,685
I was small at that time, so they did
not show me my mom for last time.

1492
01:32:38,118 --> 01:32:41,292
Same time the lightening
struck that evening..

1493
01:32:42,689 --> 01:32:45,727

01:32:48,027 --> 01:32:49,472

Am I hearing right?

1605
01:40:26,452 --> 01:40:27,863
Or is it some dream?

1606
01:40:29,789 --> 01:40:31,097
Just pinch me. Pinch.

1607
01:40:34,093 --> 01:40:36,198

Oh.

1610
01:40:46,906 --> 01:40:50,115
But we can't tell our families.
Io one would understand.

1611
01:40:52,678 --> 01:40:53,679
Don't worry.

1612
01:40:54,580 --> 01:41:00,030
I'll plan something that
your family would agree.

1613
01:41:00,620 --> 01:41:01,621
Okay?

1617
01:41:14,300 --> 01:41:17,304
There's Soniyo! Hurry up.
Listen up.

1618
01:41:18,237 --> 01:41:19,648
Mark! Soniyo!

1619
01:41:19,739 --> 01:41:21,878
How did you escaped from
that bloody gang of Kutty?

1620
01:41:22,041 --> 01:41:23,748
Sir, she'll explain.
- Yeah.

1621
01:41:24,577 --> 01:41:28,491
Actually when I went to see
that place, than there...

1622
01:41:51,404 --> 01:41:52,678
C'mon Soniyo!

1623
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:56,078
I was not at fault too, dad.

1624
01:41:56,375 --> 01:41:59,982
And, the way you think
it's nothing of that kind.

1625
01:42:00,446 --> 01:42:03,655
Then what were you two doing
alone in the camps alone.

1626
01:42:04,650 --> 01:42:05,924
Waiting for the oldie?

1627
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:10,792
Actually... I had gone to take
some photos with my camera.

1628
01:42:11,657 --> 01:42:15,298
And Mark was there to collect
some wood for bonï¬re..

1629
01:42:15,728 --> 01:42:18,265
..he started to talk about
his glass pieces.

1630
01:42:18,531 --> 01:42:21,307
Glass pieces?
Hey, what's that?

1631
01:42:21,867 --> 01:42:24,143
Brother, it's Mark's hobby.

1632
01:42:24,370 --> 01:42:26,714
He makes hand toned glass pieces.

1633
01:42:26,939 --> 01:42:29,010
And he had to exhibit that.

1634
01:42:29,341 --> 01:42:33,414
So... He asked me to talk
about it with dad.

1635
01:42:35,214 --> 01:42:37,558
All these years, before this""

1636
01:42:37,917 --> 01:42:42,423
..We.. I and Mark were not even
on hello, hi, terms.

1637
01:42:49,662 --> 01:42:54,907
Just, while dancing, we developed
a friend type rapport.

1638
01:42:56,502 --> 01:42:59,972
Listen dear, I feel that
Soniyo is not a fault at all.

1639
01:43:00,139 --> 01:43:02,415
Look, how scared she looks,
my dear child.

1640
01:43:02,708 --> 01:43:04,346
You keep quiet.
Don't interfere.

1641
01:43:04,944 --> 01:43:05,945
Then?

1642
01:43:06,746 --> 01:43:13,493
And then... I saw a wolf...
a wild dog is staring us.

1643
01:43:14,286 --> 01:43:15,993
I was just paralyzed.

1644
01:43:16,222 --> 01:43:19,760
But the wolf or the dog
whatever it was came towards us..

1645
01:43:19,792 --> 01:43:20,463
Oh God!

1646
01:43:20,493 --> 01:43:22,063
And than Mark came and saved me.

1647
01:43:22,561 --> 01:43:23,835
And we climbed up the tree.

1648
01:43:24,363 --> 01:43:27,105
And when climbed down, we
fell in the hands of Kutti Karan.

1649

This Mark too is...

1657
01:43:56,228 --> 01:43:58,799
I should meet Mark and
clear everything.

1658
01:44:29,728 --> 01:44:30,729

1659
01:44:31,564 --> 01:44:32,565

or doubt, to clear that.

Look.

1666
01:44:51,617 --> 01:44:53,494
If there was something
between Mark and me..

1667
01:44:53,686 --> 01:44:55,688
""than why'd I have got
engaged with you?

1668
01:44:56,255 --> 01:44:58,929
Also everyone is aware
that Mark is a good boy.

1669
01:44:59,425 --> 01:45:01,701

01:47:50,996 --> 01:47:53,704
Vikram? - Asked to come
without informing anyone.

1717
01:47:53,932 --> 01:47:54,933
Why?

1718
01:47:56,301 --> 01:47:57,575
He had few questions.

1719
01:47:57,936 --> 01:48:03,352
And... He did not want that
anyone of you inï¬uence my answers.

1720
01:48:03,542 --> 01:48:04,543
wow,

1721
01:48:05,611 --> 01:48:09,354
Do these fools think that
we tutor our daughter?

1722
01:48:09,548 --> 01:48:10,720
Io, dad...
- You listen...

1723
01:48:10,916 --> 01:48:13,453
You aren't sent off yet.
You still are from this house.

1724
01:48:13,886 --> 01:48:15,627
And stop siding them.

1725
01:48:16,255 --> 01:48:19,759
Brother, not all of them.
This was only Vikram's plan.

1726
01:48:20,092 --> 01:48:22,868
See dad. They have started
to teach planning to the girl.

1727
01:48:23,762 --> 01:48:27,335
Why not.
He's an army returned.

1728
01:48:28,434 --> 01:48:30,471
So his mouth has opened
a big wider.

1729
01:48:31,437 --> 01:48:32,643
I'll talk to him.

1730
01:48:33,005 --> 01:48:35,611
Dad, please.
At least you be cool.

1731
01:48:36,408 --> 01:48:39,855
Vikram is hot minded.
God knows what he might do.

1732
01:48:40,679 --> 01:48:42,989
It'd be nothing to you.
You well send me there..

1733
01:48:43,949 --> 01:48:46,759
""but it's me who will have
to spend my life with them.

1734
01:48:47,152 --> 01:48:48,153
Saw?

1735
01:48:48,687 --> 01:48:50,564
How matured my Soniyo has become!

1736
01:48:51,190 --> 01:48:52,362
She is right, dear.

1737
01:48:52,458 --> 01:48:55,667
Look, don't mention anything
to them about this.

1738
01:48:56,428 --> 01:48:58,032
That's right, but...

1739
01:48:59,031 --> 01:49:02,274
Vikram, without informing
both the families.

1740
01:49:02,901 --> 01:49:06,007
..is not right asking questions
to Soniyo like this.

1741
01:49:06,605 --> 01:49:08,312
Uncle, he must have made mistake.

1742
01:49:08,607 --> 01:49:09,677
Actually I too thought.

1743
01:49:09,741 --> 01:49:12,654
..that I should meet Soniyo in the
college and sort the matter out.

1744
01:49:13,312 --> 01:49:16,521
But than I felt, elders of the
family must be informed ï¬rst.

1745
01:49:16,815 --> 01:49:19,352
..so that there is no doubts
or misunderstanding in future.

1746
01:49:19,918 --> 01:49:20,919
Isn't it, uncle?

1747
01:49:22,321 --> 01:49:23,425
You did right.

1748
01:49:25,057 --> 01:49:27,367
The amount of garbage
you kids scatter""

1749
01:49:27,626 --> 01:49:31,597
""cleaning of that can only
be done by we elders.

1750
01:49:31,763 --> 01:49:32,764
Of course. Of course.

1751
01:49:32,998 --> 01:49:36,639
Low let it be, Bunnu.
What had to happen, happened.

1752
01:49:36,969 --> 01:49:40,712
It was good that Mark was
with Soniyo so our child survived.

1753
01:49:41,173 --> 01:49:44,245
If she was kidnapped alone, and
something untoward had happened..

1754
01:49:44,543 --> 01:49:46,682
..no one knows what more
trouble we would be in.

1755
01:49:47,346 --> 01:49:48,381
Yes, son.

1756
01:49:49,214 --> 01:49:51,922
You saved my Soniyo from the
clutches of Kutti..

1757
01:49:52,451 --> 01:49:54,954
..and brought her home safely...

1758
01:49:55,487 --> 01:49:58,331
Thank you, son.
May God bless you.

1759
01:49:58,490 --> 01:49:59,491
Thank you, aunty.

1760
01:49:59,691 --> 01:50:02,001
So, uncle, may I leave?

1761
01:50:02,027 --> 01:50:03,028
Yes.

1762
01:50:03,262 --> 01:50:04,263
Good night everyone.

1763
01:50:04,563 --> 01:50:05,564
Bye, Soniyo. - Bye.

1764
01:50:05,931 --> 01:50:06,932
Wait.

1765
01:50:19,311 --> 01:50:23,521
If I can organize your glass
pieces' exhibition""

1766
01:50:24,516 --> 01:50:25,859
""than I will certainly do it.

1767
01:50:28,854 --> 01:50:30,595
Soniyo has told me everything.

1768
01:50:30,856 --> 01:50:32,961
Oh! Cool, dude!
- What?

1769
01:50:33,058 --> 01:50:35,868
Oh, I mean. Thank you uncle, sir.

1770

01:50:53,178 --> 01:50:56,648

It's like this.

1844
01:56:51,536 --> 01:56:52,606
One second.

1845
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:55,640
Hello!

1846
01:56:56,908 --> 01:56:58,080
Where are you, Soniyo?

1847
01:56:58,476 --> 01:56:59,648
In college.

1848
01:57:00,946 --> 01:57:02,152
What are you doing?

1849
01:57:02,347 --> 01:57:03,417
Dance practice.

1850
01:57:05,317 --> 01:57:07,024
With whom?
- With Mark.

1851
01:57:07,652 --> 01:57:09,461
But Vikram... so may questions?

1852
01:57:09,821 --> 01:57:10,891
What's the matter?

1853
01:57:11,890 --> 01:57:15,235
The thing is, today I was coming
to pick you from the college.

1854
01:57:16,061 --> 01:57:17,062
Remember?

1855
01:57:17,829 --> 01:57:18,864
Oh, I forgot.

1856
01:57:20,332 --> 01:57:22,243
Outside I called you too.

1857
01:57:22,734 --> 01:57:24,042
But you did not even hear.

1858
01:57:25,503 --> 01:57:28,279
With Mark, you seem quite happy?

1859
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:30,916
But, Vikram...
Why are you all this...

1860
01:57:31,409 --> 01:57:34,219
Me? Look at you, Soniyo.

1861

There are already many rumors
involving you and Mark..

1862
01:57:38,316 --> 01:57:40,193
..and you're still
hanging out with him?

1863
01:57:40,819 --> 01:57:42,196
It's dance, Vikram.

1864
01:57:42,554 --> 01:57:43,931
I don't care.

1865
01:57:44,489 --> 01:57:46,400
As of today, there shouldn't
be any dance.

1866
01:57:47,058 --> 01:57:48,628
I am waiting for you outside.

1867
01:57:48,793 --> 01:57:50,466
Let's go home.
And I mean now.

01:58:38,476 --> 01:58:39,511
Chill, bro. Chill!

He's gone.

So bad Vikram.

1877
01:58:50,488 --> 01:58:51,523

Sir! - Just a minute.

1884
01:59:20,151 --> 01:59:23,325
Io, no. It's nothing.
I was just asking.

1885
01:59:25,857 --> 01:59:26,801
Hello.

1886
01:59:26,858 --> 01:59:30,305
Io, Vikram. Surely you
have some misunderstanding.

1887
01:59:30,862 --> 01:59:33,138
I just talked with Soniyds mother.

1888
01:59:33,832 --> 01:59:36,403
She said Soniyo reached
home half an hour ago.

1889
01:59:37,135 --> 01:59:38,546
It can't be, uncle.

1890
01:59:38,770 --> 01:59:41,751
I personal went inside and
saw Soniyo. She is dancing there.

1891
01:59:42,173 --> 01:59:44,380
And since I am keeping a watch
on the gate here for an hour.

1892
01:59:44,909 --> 01:59:46,411
She hasn't left from there yet.

1893
01:59:46,811 --> 01:59:50,349
But son...
why'd your aunt lie to ma?

1894
01:59:50,482 --> 01:59:52,393
That you better ask aunty.

1895
01:59:53,585 --> 01:59:55,064
You are at the gallery, isn't it?

1896
01:59:55,253 --> 01:59:59,133
I will come and pick you up
and the gallery and go together.

1897
01:59:59,357 --> 02:00:00,358
All right, son.

1898
02:00:06,598 --> 02:00:08,908
You? Son, Vikram you too?
- My respects.

1899
02:00:09,167 --> 02:00:10,339
Have a long life, son.

1900
02:00:10,435 --> 02:00:11,641
ls Soniyo at home?

1901
02:00:11,770 --> 02:00:13,681
Yes, she is in her room.

1902
02:00:14,038 --> 02:00:15,108
Come with me.

1903
02:00:39,864 --> 02:00:40,865
Hi, Vikram.

1904
02:00:41,399 --> 02:00:42,400

Soniyo has no twin sister""

1908

""than it can only be answered
by here mother.

1909
02:00:56,815 --> 02:00:58,055
What happened, dear?

1910
02:01:00,618 --> 02:01:02,256
What it is, Vikram?

1911
02:01:08,860 --> 02:01:10,168
Dear, go take rest.

1912
02:01:10,528 --> 02:01:11,529
Yes.

1913
02:01:14,599 --> 02:01:15,600
Yes, dad.

1914
02:01:16,668 --> 02:01:17,942
Yeah, Soniyo is at home.

1915
02:01:18,336 --> 02:01:19,371
I don't know.

1916
02:01:20,171 --> 02:01:21,377
Yes, I did see her.

1917
02:01:23,408 --> 02:01:24,512

Daddy wants to talk to you.

1919
02:01:32,483 --> 02:01:33,484
Yes.

1920
02:01:35,587 --> 02:01:37,191
Io, friend, today it's difï¬cult.

1921
02:01:38,690 --> 02:01:40,567
Io, I just left my work and came.

1922
02:01:41,759 --> 02:01:43,397
And now I have to go back too.

1923
02:01:46,431 --> 02:01:49,207
We'll do this.
We'll meet in a couple of days..

1924
02:01:49,667 --> 02:01:52,443
..and than we shall decide
as to what's to do further.

1925
02:01:53,504 --> 02:01:54,505

God bless you.

1929
02:02:03,248 --> 02:02:04,249
Okay, son.

1930

Low tell me what happened?

1931
02:02:11,589 --> 02:02:12,932
What's there to tell.

1932
02:02:13,791 --> 02:02:18,262
Your to be son-in-law has
gone senile in his youth.

1933
02:02:19,631 --> 02:02:20,632
God!

1934
02:02:21,132 --> 02:02:23,339
Low I am worried about my Soniyo.

1935
02:02:29,173 --> 02:02:31,517
Bro, are you going
to Ofï¬ceï¬s Club?

1936
02:02:32,443 --> 02:02:34,013
Drop me to mid way.

1937
02:02:34,646 --> 02:02:35,681
Where are you going?

1938
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:36,952
Just at Mark's house.

1939
02:02:39,651 --> 02:02:40,721
What?

1940
02:02:42,654 --> 02:02:46,329
What can one expect from others
when one's own coin is bad.

1941
02:02:46,457 --> 02:02:47,458
Brother"".

1942
02:02:47,859 --> 02:02:50,703
..as it is melodramatic serials
are in overdose at home""

1943
02:02:51,129 --> 02:02:52,540
..and now you too don't start.

1944
02:02:57,135 --> 02:02:58,409
0k, tell me something.

1945
02:02:59,904 --> 02:03:01,975
Does Mark says
anything about Soniyo?

1946
02:03:03,841 --> 02:03:06,378
Bro, even if he has something
in his heart.

1947
02:03:06,678 --> 02:03:09,181
..why would he say it
in front of me? Common sense.

1948
02:03:10,949 --> 02:03:12,292
Come. I will drop you.

1949
02:03:15,086 --> 02:03:16,463
Soniyo! - Yes.

1950
02:03:16,988 --> 02:03:18,865
The boy is indeed talented.

1951
02:03:20,458 --> 02:03:22,369
Handloom graphics are
much in demand.

1952
02:03:22,694 --> 02:03:25,106
In big hotels and big people.
Isn't it, dad?

1953
02:03:25,496 --> 02:03:26,839
Yes, of course.

1954
02:03:27,332 --> 02:03:30,905
I will do this, all the real estate
customers which I have..

1955
02:03:31,002 --> 02:03:32,913
...I will invite all of them
to the exhibition.

1956
02:03:33,237 --> 02:03:34,978
And of course exhibition
will be a success.

1957
02:03:35,106 --> 02:03:37,882
..when there will be hot tea
and hot dumplings.

1958
02:03:40,178 --> 02:03:41,122
Just tea?

1959
02:03:41,145 --> 02:03:42,146
Why, should I make it coffee?

1960
02:03:43,348 --> 02:03:44,793
Hey, go ahead say the rest.

1961
02:03:45,149 --> 02:03:49,256
Actually, uncle... I was thinking
more like... wine and cheese-

1962
02:03:51,756 --> 02:03:53,793
Budget will slightly increase.

1963
02:03:54,025 --> 02:03:58,770
But now days in posh places
it's wine and cheese which rules.

1964
02:03:59,030 --> 02:04:01,067
And these elite don't eat
samosas etc. now a days.

1965
02:04:01,165 --> 02:04:03,907
Last time too you distributed
all the Samosas among relatives.

1966
02:04:04,002 --> 02:04:04,810
Do you remember?

1967
02:04:04,836 --> 02:04:05,837
Brilliant point.

1968
02:04:05,903 --> 02:04:08,144
Fine, than we'll this""

1969
02:04:08,573 --> 02:04:11,452
...along with wine we'll keep
cheese dumplings.

1970
02:04:12,310 --> 02:04:13,380
Why not!

1971
02:04:29,627 --> 02:04:30,628
What?

1972
02:04:31,696 --> 02:04:33,767
Good that I came to drop you here.

1973
02:04:41,072 --> 02:04:42,210
Bye, bro.

1974
02:04:44,575 --> 02:04:45,053
Bye.

1975
02:04:45,076 --> 02:04:47,113
0k, Mark. I will make a move.

1976
02:04:47,712 --> 02:04:49,555
Take care. - Okay.

1977
02:04:53,951 --> 02:04:55,055
Oh! - Hi, bro.

1978
02:05:01,893 --> 02:05:04,635
In this condition, will it be right
for you to go to Mark's exhibition?

1979
02:05:05,696 --> 02:05:07,198
So, should I keep mourning?

1980
02:05:07,999 --> 02:05:10,001
There is no logic for anything
in this house, man.

1981
02:05:12,370 --> 02:05:13,713
Mark is my best friend.

1982
02:05:14,939 --> 02:05:16,509
You are hiding something, isn't it?

1983
02:05:16,841 --> 02:05:18,081
Why are you thinking so?

1984
02:05:18,709 --> 02:05:22,316
Look, if you know something,
tell us.

1985
02:05:22,780 --> 02:05:24,157
It's only a...

1986
02:05:24,382 --> 02:05:26,020
Soniyo is also my friend.

1987
02:05:26,717 --> 02:05:29,960
And that's I have this feeling...
there is something cooking.

1988
02:05:32,223 --> 02:05:33,327
I feel, marriage""

1989
02:05:35,026 --> 02:05:36,869
..is a bond of love.

1990
02:05:37,595 --> 02:05:40,007
In which application of force
isn't good.

1991
02:05:40,698 --> 02:05:43,008
But this alliance is ï¬nalized
with Soniyo's consent, isn't it?

1992
02:05:43,534 --> 02:05:45,207
Then what force?

1993
02:05:46,204 --> 02:05:48,582
Who did ever consulted
the poor girl.

1994
02:05:49,107 --> 02:05:51,815
She was just informed that
she is getting married to Vikram.

1995
02:05:52,009 --> 02:05:53,989
Of course she could have
then informed everyone.

1996
02:05:54,112 --> 02:05:55,614
At least to her family?

1997
02:05:56,180 --> 02:05:58,353
Even today India is full of
all types of families.

1998
02:05:58,583 --> 02:05:59,891
Few are very modern""

1999
02:06:00,118 --> 02:06:01,722
..and a few are still traditional.

2000
02:06:02,587 --> 02:06:05,830
And all the children
try their hard..

2001
02:06:06,190 --> 02:06:09,899
..that they do not hurt their
family's beliefs and culture.

2002
02:06:11,229 --> 02:06:12,401
Isn't it Mitesh?

2003
02:06:12,597 --> 02:06:13,871
Well, I don't know what to say.

2004
02:06:15,166 --> 02:06:17,806
As it is, take example of you both.

2005
02:06:18,936 --> 02:06:21,507
Mitesh and you meet
at Mintu's wedding""

2006
02:06:22,273 --> 02:06:23,911
..and both of you fall in love.

2007
02:06:25,376 --> 02:06:28,414
But you conï¬de this love
before the families...

2008
02:06:29,213 --> 02:06:30,214
ll o way.

2009
02:06:32,116 --> 02:06:33,993
And than Mitesh does
something as such""

2010
02:06:34,418 --> 02:06:36,796
""that his alliance with you
is taken up.

2011
02:06:37,788 --> 02:06:40,166
And then you meet for an
arranged marriage meeting.

2012
02:06:40,591 --> 02:06:42,264
And again approve of each other.

2013
02:06:44,328 --> 02:06:46,171
Just an absolute perfect marriage.

2014
02:06:46,430 --> 02:06:49,775
Man, I did not want both the
families to feel uncomfortable.

2015
02:06:50,268 --> 02:06:54,182
And if something can achieved
with an arranged marriage then..

2016
02:06:54,672 --> 02:06:55,946
..why unnecessary trouble?

2017
02:06:56,340 --> 02:06:57,341
Exactly.

2018
02:06:57,508 --> 02:06:58,509
Exactly.

2019
02:06:58,843 --> 02:07:00,948
This is also somewhat the
situation of Mark and Soniyo.

2020
02:07:01,913 --> 02:07:02,914
Meaning?

2021
02:07:03,481 --> 02:07:05,017
Soniyo and Mark?

2022
02:07:06,484 --> 02:07:07,485
Yeah.

2023
02:07:07,818 --> 02:07:09,161
What a great love story.

2024
02:07:11,389 --> 02:07:13,391
Despite being so close
for such a long time""

2025
02:07:14,659 --> 02:07:16,832
""they fell in love now.

2026
02:07:17,862 --> 02:07:19,500
But now they can't hurt
their families.

2027
02:07:21,399 --> 02:07:22,275
I see.

2028
02:07:22,300 --> 02:07:23,802
So whose side you are now?

2029
02:07:24,135 --> 02:07:27,275
On your brother's or your friend's?

2030
02:07:28,773 --> 02:07:31,049
Marriage is a lifelong bond.

2031
02:07:32,510 --> 02:07:35,753
A small mistake meaning,
repent forever.

2032
02:07:36,981 --> 02:07:41,430
And I don't wish that Soniyo should
undergo punishment by marrying brother.

2033
02:07:43,988 --> 02:07:44,989
I'm with her.

2034
02:07:45,890 --> 02:07:46,891
Great!

2035
02:07:47,291 --> 02:07:50,602
Then let Mark and Soniyo's
secret remain a secret. - Yes.

2036
02:07:50,795 --> 02:07:53,401
And let everything continue
the way it is continuing.

2037
02:07:53,965 --> 02:07:55,808
But, brother...?

2038
02:07:56,601 --> 02:07:57,705
He won't understand.

2039
02:07:57,768 --> 02:07:59,179
Of course he won't understand...

2040
02:08:06,077 --> 02:08:09,684
That my own brother turned out
to be such a rascal.

2041
02:08:18,990 --> 02:08:20,663
Are we going to
the exhibition or not?

2042
02:09:01,098 --> 02:09:02,099
This my...

Come.

my underpants are wet or not!

Okay, so it's this?

2060

All right. So let's celebrate
honeymoon here itself.

2061
02:10:01,225 --> 02:10:03,637
You seem half ready.

2062
02:10:04,829 --> 02:10:06,206
Come on, let's go, man.

2063
02:10:07,264 --> 02:10:08,265
Please don't go.

2064
02:10:08,332 --> 02:10:10,812
Are you mad,
my pants are down too.

2065
02:10:10,901 --> 02:10:11,777
Mark!

2066
02:10:11,802 --> 02:10:13,179
Oh dad!

2067
02:10:13,971 --> 02:10:15,450
Come on, Mark let's go.
Please!

2068
02:10:15,539 --> 02:10:17,280
Dad is here.
Have you gone mad?

2069
02:10:17,308 --> 02:10:18,378
Mark!
- What are you doing...

2070
02:10:19,610 --> 02:10:20,611
H ey, Mark.

2071
02:10:21,545 --> 02:10:23,024
Where has he gone?

2072
02:10:23,714 --> 02:10:25,921
Guests have started coming
and he's not to be...

2073
02:10:27,051 --> 02:10:29,895
low! The showroom door
is kept open.

2074
02:10:34,258 --> 02:10:35,259
Strange.

2075
02:10:35,459 --> 02:10:36,631
Mansher too is nowhere.

2076
02:10:37,895 --> 02:10:39,203
Where have they all gone?

2077
02:11:01,852 --> 02:11:02,853
Dad...

2078
02:11:03,187 --> 02:11:04,188
He's left.

2079
02:11:06,157 --> 02:11:09,229
Oh! And he also locked the door.

2080
02:11:11,262 --> 02:11:12,707
Come on, get out of here somehow.

2081
02:11:14,231 --> 02:11:15,642
You don't leave.

2082
02:11:19,270 --> 02:11:20,874
Leave here.
- 0k, ï¬ne. Let's go.

2083
02:11:21,338 --> 02:11:22,544
Come on, let's go.

2084
02:11:23,073 --> 02:11:24,279
Easy, 839V-

2085
02:11:25,509 --> 02:11:27,546
Almost there. Almost there.
ExceHenL

2086
02:11:29,747 --> 02:11:30,748
Come, come.

2087
02:11:31,315 --> 02:11:32,316
Easy!

2088
02:11:35,486 --> 02:11:36,487
0k, let's go.

2089
02:11:39,023 --> 02:11:39,956
Mark! - Yes?

2090
02:11:39,957 --> 02:11:41,561
My earring is lost.

2091
02:11:41,759 --> 02:11:42,567
Earring?

2092
02:11:42,593 --> 02:11:43,594
Search.

2093
02:11:47,131 --> 02:11:49,077
Wow! Look here.

2094
02:11:52,336 --> 02:11:53,337
Yes, son.

2095
02:11:53,637 --> 02:11:54,980
Everything is just before us.

2096
02:11:55,105 --> 02:11:57,381
Where before you, uncle?
Saw my earring?

2097
02:11:57,575 --> 02:11:59,316
Earring? Which earring?

2098
02:11:59,577 --> 02:12:01,853
_ ear_ring.
Whnch Mark ls helpmg me to search.

2099
02:12:02,680 --> 02:12:04,557
Whenever this Mark is with you..

2100
02:12:04,949 --> 02:12:07,395
..either earrings are lost or you!

2101
02:12:07,485 --> 02:12:08,862
Come buddy, Balli!

2102
02:12:09,119 --> 02:12:12,931
For God's sake at least shut
your box of complaints today.

2103
02:12:13,190 --> 02:12:14,931
This is a big day for this boy.

2104
02:12:15,292 --> 02:12:18,034
And ï¬rst time at my place there
is party with cheese and wine.

2105
02:12:18,362 --> 02:12:19,636
Come let's join it, man!

2106
02:12:20,364 --> 02:12:22,401
Join the fun. My foot!

2107
02:12:22,633 --> 02:12:25,443
Let it be. First tell me..

2108
02:12:26,170 --> 02:12:28,514
..do we look fools?

2109
02:12:29,340 --> 02:12:31,547
Come on, Bally,
what are you saying?

2110
02:12:31,575 --> 02:12:33,282
Just let your false game be.

2111
02:12:33,744 --> 02:12:35,690
These guys look innocent
children to you?

2112
02:12:36,280 --> 02:12:37,816
All of them have gone
blind in their minds.

2113
02:12:39,850 --> 02:12:40,851
Uncle!
- Granny...

2114
02:12:41,418 --> 02:12:42,453
Blind?

2115
02:12:43,220 --> 02:12:45,257
What is he talking about?
- Who it is?

2116
02:12:45,322 --> 02:12:46,858
What are you talking?
- ls she hot?

2117
02:12:47,324 --> 02:12:49,702
Damn you, she's Mark's granny.
- It's enough now.

2118
02:12:49,927 --> 02:12:52,533
I don't want to let my son have
any relations with your kind.

2119
02:12:54,064 --> 02:12:55,065
Why, uncle?

2120
02:12:55,199 --> 02:12:58,703
Just because Mark was helping me
to look for my earring?

2121
02:12:58,969 --> 02:13:02,314
With this innocent face or yours
ask this questions to someone else.

2122
02:13:02,540 --> 02:13:03,644
Io, no, no.

2123
02:13:04,141 --> 02:13:06,212
He himself has come to our
house and stayed.

2124
02:13:06,644 --> 02:13:10,091
And my life's experience
cant's lie to me.

2125
02:13:11,181 --> 02:13:14,651
Soniyo is very innocent and
pure hearted.

2126
02:13:15,019 --> 02:13:17,260
And my Mark's heart is a child.

2127
02:13:17,621 --> 02:13:18,929
They are both innocents, sir.

2128
02:13:18,989 --> 02:13:20,935
Innocent? Let that be.

2129
02:13:21,525 --> 02:13:24,267
I doubt not only the girl
but her entire family.

2130
02:13:24,695 --> 02:13:27,198
Son, come. I don't want to
stay here even for a minute.

2131
02:13:27,631 --> 02:13:28,405
Dear, come let's go.

2132
02:13:28,432 --> 02:13:29,433
<i>âw, Ban!</i>

2133
02:13:33,537 --> 02:13:35,414
As it is this ï¬ower like girl..

2134
02:13:35,673 --> 02:13:38,017
..and in a place like yours?
My foot!

2135
02:13:44,114 --> 02:13:47,561
Then take her to your home.
For good.

2136
02:13:48,319 --> 02:13:50,560
I would certainly, my child.

2137
02:13:50,955 --> 02:13:53,959
If everything is happening
due to my Mark..l

2138
02:13:54,224 --> 02:13:56,568
""than it becomes
my responsibility too.

2139
02:13:57,127 --> 02:13:59,107
So, today,
in presence of everyone..

2140
02:13:59,496 --> 02:14:02,477
...I raise the topic of alliance
with Soniyo and Mark"".

2141
02:14:02,967 --> 02:14:06,210
..so that this nonsense talks
are stopped for ever.

2142
02:14:08,572 --> 02:14:09,607
Then ï¬ne.

2143
02:14:10,207 --> 02:14:11,652
There is no need of this too.

2144
02:14:16,280 --> 02:14:17,281
Stop it!

2145
02:14:18,449 --> 02:14:19,723
Vikram you're hurting me!

2146
02:14:21,218 --> 02:14:22,288
Brother!
- Mark!

2147
02:14:28,659 --> 02:14:29,660
Mark, leave him!

2148
02:14:40,904 --> 02:14:41,905
Mark!

2149
02:14:43,807 --> 02:14:45,548
Stop!
What you two are doing?

2150
02:14:50,047 --> 02:14:52,687
Mark.
What have you done?

2151
02:14:53,283 --> 02:14:55,729
Whatever he did is right.

2152
02:14:56,120 --> 02:15:00,500
Will anyone behave in such barbaric
manner with an innocent girl?

2153
02:15:01,125 --> 02:15:04,334
So of course there should be a
real man to give a beï¬tting reply.

2154
02:15:04,862 --> 02:15:06,307
Mark, my child, come here.

2155
02:15:09,166 --> 02:15:10,167
Come my child.

2156
02:15:11,869 --> 02:15:12,870
Soniyo.

2157
02:15:13,137 --> 02:15:15,174
Do you accept Mark's proposal?

2158
02:15:17,675 --> 02:15:19,586
Whatever you think appropriate.

2159
02:15:20,411 --> 02:15:21,583
And Mark, you?

2160
02:15:23,347 --> 02:15:25,588
Granny this all started due to me..

2161
02:15:26,183 --> 02:15:27,287
..so I and it.

2162
02:15:29,720 --> 02:15:31,757
Soniyo, will you marry ma?

2163
02:15:31,889 --> 02:15:34,426
But son, you are still very young?

2164
02:15:34,925 --> 02:15:37,872
What was your age
when you got married?

2165
02:15:38,295 --> 02:15:41,504
Me...? I was... I was in college.

2166
02:15:42,166 --> 02:15:45,409
So brother, are these two
school going kids?

2167
02:15:45,836 --> 02:15:48,783
And as it is, we will get them
married a leisure, sir.

2168
02:15:49,573 --> 02:15:51,575
Yeah. Yes... yes...

2169
02:15:51,809 --> 02:15:53,083
Unless of course...

2170
02:15:54,111 --> 02:15:58,582
You or your family has any problems
with us or Mark.

2171
02:15:58,849 --> 02:16:01,329
Io brother. Why are you saying it?

2172
02:16:01,952 --> 02:16:03,898
Actually we should be the one
to ask this question.

2173
02:16:03,954 --> 02:16:08,835
Because isn't Soniyo's engagement
is broken before you.

2174
02:16:09,226 --> 02:16:10,728
Hey, forget about him.

2175
02:16:10,894 --> 02:16:12,396
Low that topic has become sissy.

2176
02:16:13,330 --> 02:16:14,274
Mark!

2177
02:16:14,298 --> 02:16:15,299
Yes.

2178
02:16:17,835 --> 02:16:20,247
Here, take this and
put this in her ï¬ngers.

2179
02:16:20,771 --> 02:16:21,772
Thanks, granny.

2180
02:16:22,372 --> 02:16:23,373
Soniyo!

2181
02:16:52,202 --> 02:16:53,613
Ladies and gentlemen!

2182
02:16:54,371 --> 02:16:55,873
This is Mark Braganza..

2183
02:16:56,707 --> 02:17:01,918
...for whose hand blown glasses'
exhibition we've gathered here.

2184
02:17:02,179 --> 02:17:03,385
Give him a big hand!

2185
02:17:06,283 --> 02:17:08,354
And now everybody let's 90..

2186
02:17:08,552 --> 02:17:10,759
..among the an. Please.

2187
02:17:10,821 --> 02:17:12,129
Hey!
- Come with me!

2188
02:17:12,289 --> 02:17:13,233
Let's go.

2189
02:17:13,257 --> 02:17:14,258
Come.

2190
02:17:16,326 --> 02:17:17,236
How're you feeling?

2191
02:17:17,261 --> 02:17:18,604
lam feeling good.
How're you feeling?

2192
02:17:18,729 --> 02:17:20,640
I mean, we have done it, somehow.

2193
02:17:22,900 --> 02:17:23,901
Finally.

2194
02:17:25,068 --> 02:17:26,069
ll-

2195
02:17:27,504 --> 02:17:28,574
Look there.
- What's the matter?

2196
02:17:28,605 --> 02:17:29,811
Look over there.
- What?

2197
02:17:36,446 --> 02:17:37,584
Let's go check it up. Come.

2198
02:17:47,291 --> 02:17:49,328
What?
All this was a drama?

2199
02:17:50,060 --> 02:17:51,869
I mean... when was it...?

2200
02:17:52,129 --> 02:17:54,473
Just before coming here.

2201
02:17:55,566 --> 02:17:58,672
Hey, I know you guys since
childhood. Had you said once...

2202
02:17:58,936 --> 02:18:00,108
I can't believe this!

2203
02:18:00,337 --> 02:18:02,783
And we felt that...
You are really cross with us.

2204
02:18:02,906 --> 02:18:04,180
Soniyo, I am a soldier""

2205
02:18:05,509 --> 02:18:07,511
..and entire nation trusts us.

2206
02:18:08,412 --> 02:18:10,153
You should just said once
and seen.

2207
02:18:11,615 --> 02:18:15,188
Who knows to sacriï¬ce
better than an Army Ofï¬cer?

2208
02:18:16,220 --> 02:18:17,722
Vikram, acutely thing is..

2209
02:18:18,255 --> 02:18:21,361
""we felt that you won't be
able to understand.

2210
02:18:21,458 --> 02:18:22,937
Mark, how could you think so?

2211
02:18:23,560 --> 02:18:26,598
A soldier who at the border
and places his life at stake""

2212
02:18:26,930 --> 02:18:29,206
...and insures the
smiles of millions..

2213
02:18:29,666 --> 02:18:32,306
..how could he snatch smiles
from your faces?

2214
02:18:33,337 --> 02:18:34,338
ll ot fair.

2215
02:18:36,340 --> 02:18:38,081
I think, you deserve a salute.

2216
02:18:39,810 --> 02:18:41,153
Come on guys now...

2217
02:18:43,413 --> 02:18:44,790
Damn you, who are you
saluting there?

2218
02:18:45,182 --> 02:18:46,456
A driver is standing there.

2219
02:18:46,717 --> 02:18:48,060
Vikram is here.

2220
02:18:51,521 --> 02:18:52,591
Brother"".

2221
02:18:52,956 --> 02:18:55,129
...I mean, you should have told me.

2222
02:18:55,392 --> 02:18:57,895
Then your reactions wouldn't
have been natural.

2223
02:18:59,596 --> 02:19:01,906
You know, dude.
You are really something else.

2224
02:19:02,165 --> 02:19:03,940
And... I am sorry for the punch.

2225
02:19:05,769 --> 02:19:06,770
What? Really?

2226
02:19:07,237 --> 02:19:08,238
Yeah.

2227
02:19:10,507 --> 02:19:11,508
Take it back then.

2228
02:19:12,409 --> 02:19:13,080
Oh!

2229
02:19:13,110 --> 02:19:14,384
Vikram... - Brother!
- What do you...

2230
02:19:14,645 --> 02:19:16,215
What are you doing?
- Continue the drama.

2231
02:19:16,313 --> 02:19:18,350
Soniyo's father is coming.
- Oh!

2232
02:19:18,482 --> 02:19:19,722
Damn you, come...

2233
02:19:20,050 --> 02:19:21,051
Minu, Minu!

2234
02:19:21,518 --> 02:19:23,259
Like this...
- What are they doing?

2235
02:19:23,387 --> 02:19:24,388
Here take this!

2236
02:19:24,554 --> 02:19:25,464
What are you doing?

2237
02:19:25,489 --> 02:19:26,934
He's hitting him.

2238
02:19:27,925 --> 02:19:28,926
Stop them.

2239
02:19:29,159 --> 02:19:29,967
Take one more.

2240
02:19:29,993 --> 02:19:31,131
Someone stop them.

2241
02:19:31,361 --> 02:19:33,238
Will you dare...

2242
02:19:33,697 --> 02:19:35,904
Look they are hitting
my father. Look he...

2243
02:19:36,033 --> 02:19:37,341
Take some more.
- Why are you hitting. Stop

2244
02:19:37,367 --> 02:19:38,675
Hey...
- He's is my...

2245
02:19:39,036 --> 02:19:40,515
He is my father.
- What?

2246
02:19:42,105 --> 02:19:45,951
Damn you! Blind!
Don't you recon ma?

2247
02:19:48,879 --> 02:19:49,949
Come here!

2248
02:19:52,149 --> 02:19:53,958
What were you doing?
He's her dad.

2249
02:19:54,084 --> 02:19:55,188
Don't know he...

2250
02:20:08,265 --> 02:20:10,802
""Soniyo, 0 Soniyo""

2251
02:20:11,802 --> 02:20:15,147
""Love you Soniyo""

2252
02:20:31,088 --> 02:20:34,626

02:20:42,132 --> 02:20:45,306

'0 Soniyo, 0 my Soniyo""

2257
02:20:49,206 --> 02:20:52,779
""You are my World Cup,

2258
02:20:52,876 --> 02:20:56,346
""0 Soniyo, 0 my Soniyo""

2259
02:20:56,513 --> 02:21:00,427
""I have brought beautiful
ï¬owers for you, Soniyo""

2260
02:21:08,258 --> 02:21:11,728
""Between the lectures,
the magic of pencils""

2261
02:21:11,928 --> 02:21:14,704
""You got this story hidden""

2262
02:21:15,632 --> 02:21:22,277
""My heart became yours,
and the signal form heart came""

2263
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:26,510
""You are my fate
my anchor too is you""

2264
02:21:26,710 --> 02:21:30,123
""You are my Valentine""

2265
02:21:30,380 --> 02:21:33,691
""Wonderful, all the way""

2266
02:21:34,084 --> 02:21:37,463
""Let's all sing and dance""

2267
02:21:37,821 --> 02:21:40,927
""You are with me,
I am with you""

2268
02:21:41,458 --> 02:21:45,702
""This the story of love""

2269
02:21:49,833 --> 02:21:53,906
""Soniyo, meet with Soniyo""

2270
02:21:54,037 --> 02:21:57,314
""

2271
02:21:57,474 --> 02:22:01,286
""0 Soniyo, it's most fun Soniyo""

2272
02:22:01,478 --> 02:22:04,652
""I got the Iowa's fever my Soniyo""

02:22:16,259 --> 02:22:19,763
""I am gonna be yours""

2277
02:22:23,934 --> 02:22:25,174
Wonderful!

2278
02:22:25,836 --> 02:22:27,110
""Wonderful!

2279
02:22:35,045 --> 02:22:38,492
""You're my stick,

Deepak... kumar.

2
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:35,891
What is your full name?

3
00:03:36,463 --> 00:03:38,226
Deepak kumar. That's it.

4
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:43,960
Family background?
Tell us about your father.

5
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:48,402
I never met my father, sir.
My mother raised me.

6
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,906
I see. What does she do?

7
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:54,312
She used to work as
a domestic maid, sir.

8
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:56,978
Now she irons neighbours' clothes.

9
00:03:58,118 --> 00:04:00,143
You seem to have scored
58% in 10th grade and 61% in the 12th.

10
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:04,088
But, afterjoining s.t.m.,
i topped the b. Sc. Stream with 76%.

11
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:07,517
And in m. Sc., i stood first
in the university's merit list.

12
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:12,261
Well... we can see that.
But, mr. Deepak... kumar,

13
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:15,925
ours will be the most expensive institute
in central india.

14
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:22,004
Children of politicians, businessmen,
bureaucrats and other vips will study here.

15
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:25,138
Our aim isn't merely
to provide top class education...

16
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:27,380
but also ensure their overall development.

17
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,180
Manners, etiquette,
communication skills, body language...

18
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:35,388
y'know, almost like a... finishing school.

19
00:04:35,388 --> 00:04:37,720
You do know what
a finishing school is, don't you?

20
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:40,490
No. In fact, this is
the first time i've heard of it.

21
00:04:40,694 --> 00:04:42,162
I can understand.

22
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:43,730
After all,
given your mother's background...

23
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,493
sir, please!

24
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:49,758
You aren't even capable of
understanding my mother's background.

25
00:04:51,738 --> 00:04:55,108
And, as for manners and etiquette?

26
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:58,305
You can't find a better example
of that than me.

27
00:04:58,411 --> 00:05:00,641
You've been repeatedly mocking
my caste and status...

28
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:05,751
and yet, this paperweight
continues to remain here.

29
00:05:07,187 --> 00:05:08,211
If it weren't for manners...

30
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:11,682
i'd have branded your
institute's name on your foreheads.

31
00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:14,760
Thank you, gentlemen.

32
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:26,434
Had you asked me a single question
about my subject, you would've realised that...

33
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:30,139
a person's intelligence and performance
do not depend on his background.

34
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:32,479
You have obviously forgotten that,
given the opportunity...

35
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,472
it was a backward caste person
who drafted our country's constitution.

36
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:50,084
It's precisely this despicable mentality
that is ruining our country.

37
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:54,257
I can't believe that they studied
in this very college.

38
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:56,463
And this is their mindset!

39
00:05:58,038 --> 00:05:59,471
I have obviously failed as their teacher.

40
00:05:59,806 --> 00:06:00,704
Sir... it's okay.

41
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:03,799
No! It's not okay!

42
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:08,570
I'm sorry that by sending you there
i caused you to suffer humiliation.

43
00:06:09,215 --> 00:06:14,517
I thought that until your doctorate begins,
you could gain some experience.

44
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:19,355
And, it would also
reduce your mother's burden.

45
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:22,592
How's her backache now?

46
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:24,520
She's much better, sir.

47
00:06:25,465 --> 00:06:26,762
Do look after her well.

48
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:30,336
Have you mailed your
papers to cornell university?

49
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:33,601
Sir, actually i'd like to
do my doctorate under you.

50
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,431
Absolutely not!

51
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,401
Whatever you needed to learn from me, you have.
Time you moved ahead.

52
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:40,541
Yes, sir.

53
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:50,757
But until you leave for the us, why can't
the principal give you a job at his college?

54
00:06:50,757 --> 00:06:53,157
Mother... sir has already
helped me so much.

55
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,528
Now, if he also hires me,
won't people accuse him of favouritism?

56
00:06:57,797 --> 00:07:00,425
You're back early, hariya?

57
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:03,670
Must've sneaked out
of the evening class. Isn't it?

58
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,705
The teacher himself didn't show up.

59
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:08,241
Don't tell me his goat was stolen again.

60
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:09,509
No, not the goat.

61
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:11,711
This time they say his wife ran away
in sheer frustration.

62
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:12,575
Shut up, silly boy!

63
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:15,415
Won't you play the computer game today?

64
00:07:15,415 --> 00:07:17,484
No, got to work on important stuff.
Don't disturb me.

65
00:07:17,484 --> 00:07:19,884
Why, haven't you finished
your homework yet?

66
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:22,555
No, i have to
submit this today. Go now!

67
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:24,691
Deepu... admit it.

68
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:26,682
You're scared of losing.

69
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:31,698
- So, suppose a plus b plus...

70
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:35,259
panditji, there you go again
taking the longer route!

71
00:07:35,568 --> 00:07:38,204
Obviously! After all, he is from
the intellectual caste of our society.

72
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:42,197
How will he prove that
unless he exhibits his extra intelligence?

73
00:07:42,408 --> 00:07:44,308
But sir, my answer is
the same as that!

74
00:07:45,145 --> 00:07:47,739
Sure. But, why did you need
these extra four steps?

75
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:50,717
Sir, but i've memorized every answer.

76
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:53,208
Now, if i try the shorter route,
i could lose direction.

77
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,586
Ok.

78
00:07:57,657 --> 00:07:59,488
Congratulations, principal sir.

79
00:07:59,793 --> 00:08:03,160
Both ganesh and raghav
have been accepted into llt kanpur.

80
00:08:04,297 --> 00:08:05,594
Wow!

81
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:08,868
Well done, well done!

82
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,237
However...

83
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:15,266
your real struggle begins now.

84
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:18,176
Have some sweets, shambhu kaka.

85
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:20,610
To celebrate whose success?

86
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,848
Their success.

87
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:23,509
They've got into the engineering stream.

88
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:24,751
Wow!

89
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:28,312
Whoever studies here
is bound to succeed anywhere.

90
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:29,888
So, shall we enroll you too?

91
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:33,191
Come on, what'll i do here?

92
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,429
But, you know my daughter muniya...
she is in the tenth grade.

93
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:37,760
As soon as she clears that...

94
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:40,665
i'll plonk her in front of guruji.

95
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:42,768
She will work hard, you'll see...

96
00:08:42,869 --> 00:08:46,464
mark my words, she will become...
how d'you say it... a collector!

97
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:48,942
Dad, you aren't allowed.

98
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:50,543
Surely, just one...

99
00:08:50,543 --> 00:08:53,413
ever since the results were declared last week,
you've been gorging on sweets.

100
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:54,209
Now no more.

101
00:08:54,814 --> 00:08:57,647
You're becoming exactly
like your mother, you know that?

102
00:08:58,685 --> 00:08:59,845
You said something?

103
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:05,358
Last one!

104
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:13,356
Suppose, a+b+c+d by 2 is greater
than or equal to under root a+b...

105
00:09:15,368 --> 00:09:15,768
+c+d

106
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:17,237
did you send your papers to cornell?

107
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:19,330
Yes. But i won't be going.

108
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:21,808
You will have to, junior professor.

109
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:24,675
Because, you see,
i am going to follow you there.

110
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:27,505
Quit dreaming. I'm not going.

111
00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:30,573
Alright, don't go to cornell.

112
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,613
But, surely you can come for a movie.

113
00:09:35,722 --> 00:09:36,956
What?

114
00:09:36,956 --> 00:09:39,254
You're gawking like
i tried to molest you.

115
00:09:54,874 --> 00:09:58,970
When you ruffle your wet hair
and shower droplets all around

116
00:10:00,947 --> 00:10:02,437
it feels so good

117
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:08,479
when you part your lips
and softly whisper sweet nothings

118
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:11,685
it feels so good

119
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,891
don't float around like a fragrance,
just get to the point.

120
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:19,959
Look into my eyes and say it

121
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:22,023
don't make me wander in dreams

122
00:10:22,402 --> 00:10:25,303
in short, just say it

123
00:10:26,572 --> 00:10:29,097
just get to the point

124
00:10:30,977 --> 00:10:33,673
just get to the point

125
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,692
it's another feeling

126
00:10:58,137 --> 00:10:59,866
when you are around

127
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:17,790
when you turn around
and smile in your endearing style

128
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,849
it feels so good

129
00:11:21,494 --> 00:11:24,952
don't play around with words,
don't fool me with your act

130
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:29,696
take my hand in yours,
come out with those three little words

131
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,168
in short, just say it

132
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:36,536
just get to the point

133
00:11:38,878 --> 00:11:41,540
just get to the point

134
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:44,177
say something...

135
00:11:46,052 --> 00:11:47,952
the weather is great...

136
00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:52,686
the lake is beautiful...

137
00:11:54,627 --> 00:11:55,389
and so are you...

138
00:11:58,064 --> 00:11:59,998
can't you just get to the point?

139
00:12:27,727 --> 00:12:32,426
It's not as bad as it seems.

140
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:37,964
You're looking fit.

141
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:41,137
How about a game of badminton?

142
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:44,502
You've obviously forgotten...

143
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:49,674
that i beat you 21-15 the last time.

144
00:12:50,883 --> 00:12:56,048
I suggest you practice
some more before challenging me.

145
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,830
The moment you come
everything seems fine.

146
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,633
I am worried about them.

147
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,935
Nothing seems to have worked out.

148
00:13:17,477 --> 00:13:21,038
They want to start computer classes...

149
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:25,681
but the bank isn't sanctioning their loan.

150
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:29,481
They need a guarantor.

151
00:13:30,123 --> 00:13:31,784
The house hasn't been built completely.

152
00:13:31,824 --> 00:13:33,724
Listen...

153
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:37,957
if the bank agrees...

154
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:39,487
i'll sign as a guarantor.

155
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:44,504
As for the house,
right now they're staying in our new house.

156
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:48,964
But for how long
can we pile on to you?

157
00:13:50,776 --> 00:13:54,644
They were supposed to be there
just for two months... it's already four!

158
00:13:55,314 --> 00:14:00,251
Papa, the builder said we'll
get possession in three-four months.

159
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:03,221
That's perfect.
I don't need the house immediately.

160
00:14:03,923 --> 00:14:06,858
The college is giving me
a two-year extension.

161
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:09,225
I don't want you to worry.

162
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:14,232
You're the only one i have.

163
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:21,900
But, i can't play badminton today.

164
00:14:24,177 --> 00:14:26,668
Tomorrow, definitely tomorrow.

165
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:39,789
I'll be here.

166
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:47,561
- I'll only be a minute.
- Make it quick.

167
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:51,595
Guruji?

168
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:58,602
Guruji, guruji...

169
00:14:58,644 --> 00:15:00,544
greetings to you.

170
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:02,672
You can't leave unless
you have some tea.

171
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:05,284
Shambhu, some other day.
I'm in a rush today.

172
00:15:05,284 --> 00:15:07,420
It'll only take a minute.

173
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,186
Listen... make some tea.

174
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:26,399
She works very hard.
And, all on her own.

175
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:31,143
- Greetings guruji.
- Bless you.

176
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:32,337
What's going on here?

177
00:15:32,378 --> 00:15:33,709
- Greetings guruji.
- Bless you.

178
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:39,315
Oh my god!
What is this high-sounding formula?

179
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:41,710
- What is this?
- It's bernoulli's equation.

180
00:15:41,821 --> 00:15:43,880
I know, but what exactly does
bernoulli's equation mean?

181
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:47,387
- Make sure you keep the house clean.
- Yes.

182
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,655
- You do light a lamp at the altar, right?
- Yes, everyday.

183
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:54,328
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

184
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,459
- Take care.
- Ok.

185
00:15:56,702 --> 00:15:58,294
- So, what did we learn?

186
00:15:58,571 --> 00:16:02,837
- When air passes between
two strips of paper at high speed...

187
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:04,334
like this...

188
00:16:06,345 --> 00:16:11,112
the pressure between them
decreases and...

189
00:16:12,385 --> 00:16:14,216
they fall in love.

190
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:18,658
That means, even aeroplanes fly
using bernoulli's principle.

191
00:16:18,658 --> 00:16:20,182
Absolutely... q.e.d.

192
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,251
Oh yes, q.e. D
is quod erat demonstrandum.

193
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:25,498
Oh no, no,
q.e.d. Means...

194
00:16:25,498 --> 00:16:26,430
quite easily done!

195
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:28,199
Well, that was quite easily done.

196
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:29,459
Absolutely!

197
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,270
I'm sanjay, sir.
Commerce, 2002 batch.

198
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,510
Sanjay...

199
00:16:42,348 --> 00:16:43,144
sanjay tandon!

200
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:44,750
Banking services.

201
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,479
I'm a senior manager here,
come in, please.

202
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:48,381
Please sit.

203
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,926
Indradev, please call for
some tea and get their papers.

204
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:56,628
The papers?

205
00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:58,288
Sir, i am so happy you've come here.

206
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:06,539
Sir, even i tried to get into s.t.m.

207
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:08,564
I wanted to become a scientist.

208
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,310
But i didn't score enough
at the state level exams.

209
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:15,181
I worked hard in college
and scored well in the b. Com. Exams.

210
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:17,183
And i got a job here,
in the reserved category.

211
00:17:17,183 --> 00:17:18,548
I see.

212
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:21,620
It's only through hard work
that we win respect.

213
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,484
Yes, sir.

214
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:24,785
It was my good fortune
that i got to meet you today.

215
00:17:25,324 --> 00:17:27,460
It was a pleasure
meeting you too, indradev.

216
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,462
Ram, sir. Indradev ram.

217
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:30,360
Thank you, sir.

218
00:17:30,396 --> 00:17:31,761
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

219
00:17:31,964 --> 00:17:34,262
If there is any problem,
let me know.

220
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:36,497
Now work sincerely.

221
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:39,928
I want to see my friend happy.

222
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:41,195
Yes, uncle.

223
00:17:46,645 --> 00:17:48,476
Sushant, can't you wait?

224
00:17:48,781 --> 00:17:49,679
But, i'm starving!

225
00:17:49,715 --> 00:17:51,350
Wait for deepak to come.

226
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,214
He'll eat when he gets here.

227
00:17:52,918 --> 00:17:53,942
Why should i starve to death?

228
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,220
The parathas will go cold
if you open the container.

229
00:17:56,522 --> 00:17:57,887
Oh i see...

230
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:00,718
such glorious love!

231
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,328
Now that he is going to the us...

232
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,293
for whom will you bring hot parathas?

233
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,933
That leaves only...

234
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:10,895
me!

235
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:14,840
Then the parathas are mine and so are...

236
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,375
you wish!
Take a look in the mirror!

237
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,639
Why?
Is it worse than deepak's?

238
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:30,913
Deepak kumar, i'm extremely pleased
to appoint you as a junior lecturer at s.t.m.

239
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:32,253
Congratulations.

240
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:34,821
Thank you, sir.

241
00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:38,821
I'm proud of you.

242
00:18:50,272 --> 00:18:51,500
- Come on.

243
00:18:51,606 --> 00:18:52,903
- This is where deepak lives?

244
00:18:53,075 --> 00:18:55,210
Why didn't you tell me
you live in such a narrow lane?

245
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,700
I could barely get my car in!

246
00:18:56,778 --> 00:18:59,581
But i had built a special helipad
for you on the roof.

247
00:18:59,581 --> 00:19:02,284
Little did i know
that you'd come by road.

248
00:19:02,284 --> 00:19:06,744
I would've happily come but
your poorbi is scared of flying with me.

249
00:19:06,922 --> 00:19:08,822
Sushant! You can't even walk properly...

250
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:09,687
and you're talking of flying.

251
00:19:10,258 --> 00:19:10,917
Oh yeah?

252
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,127
Make it fast, ok?

253
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:13,526
- Shanti...

254
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,831
how are you?

255
00:19:15,831 --> 00:19:16,763
I'm good.

256
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:19,266
When it comes to a party,
you conveniently forget your leader.

257
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:21,801
Just some snacks for the kids.

258
00:19:22,304 --> 00:19:23,236
- Namaste, aunty.
- Hello.

259
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:25,834
Deepak got a job.

260
00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:27,538
Oh, this is just a temporary job, aunty.

261
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:29,978
Once he completes his doctorate in
the us, he'll get his real job.

262
00:19:29,978 --> 00:19:33,345
All of us are in for greatjobs soon.

263
00:19:33,915 --> 00:19:35,550
No one can stop
the supreme court from...

264
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,719
granting 27% reservation
for seats in higher education.

265
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:41,022
27% reservation for whom?
And, where will it come from?

266
00:19:41,022 --> 00:19:43,024
Greetings sir, please have a seat.

267
00:19:43,024 --> 00:19:44,855
It is i who should be greeting you.

268
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,252
You are a model
for the backward castes...

269
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:49,686
and great is your principal...

270
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:53,635
for going out of his way
to help backward caste kids.

271
00:19:53,635 --> 00:19:54,693
It's not like that.

272
00:19:55,137 --> 00:19:56,126
He helps everyone.

273
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,038
That's indeed the
highest of truths, deepak.

274
00:19:58,073 --> 00:19:59,908
Our principal's heart overflows
with kindness for one and all.

275
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:03,712
And his perennial intention is to furnish each
individual with a modicum of opportunity.

276
00:20:03,712 --> 00:20:04,804
Modicum of opportunity?

277
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:07,308
Meaning that he gives
everyone a chance.

278
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:08,907
Then why don't you say chance?

279
00:20:09,184 --> 00:20:10,708
That's exactly what i indicated.

280
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,090
Did you guys hear what
pandit here just indicated?

281
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:39,114
Chance!

282
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,912
Spread your wings and you'll take flight

283
00:20:42,684 --> 00:20:45,551
give me a chance and
you'll have the sky in sight

284
00:20:53,094 --> 00:20:56,231
spread your wings and you'll take flight

285
00:20:56,231 --> 00:20:59,598
give me a chance and
you'll have the sky in sight

286
00:20:59,901 --> 00:21:02,631
draw a starting line, one for all

287
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:05,936
draw a starting line, one for all

288
00:21:06,675 --> 00:21:09,610
and you'll know if courage or
god is above all

289
00:21:10,512 --> 00:21:13,504
just give me a chance

290
00:21:13,615 --> 00:21:18,453
just give me one chance, my dear,
oh my dear

291
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:19,852
and watch me take flight

292
00:21:20,055 --> 00:21:24,549
just give me one chance, my dear,
oh my dear

293
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,593
and watch me take flight

294
00:21:26,895 --> 00:21:31,229
just give me one chance, my dear,
oh my dear

295
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,262
and watch me take flight

296
00:21:34,135 --> 00:21:36,968
give me a chance, please

297
00:21:37,606 --> 00:21:40,234
give me a chance, please

298
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:51,145
chance

299
00:21:51,486 --> 00:21:54,717
just give me a chance

300
00:21:54,923 --> 00:21:57,653
it showers it's glow with every step

301
00:21:58,593 --> 00:22:00,151
let me see your moves

302
00:22:01,763 --> 00:22:04,493
my sweet darling

303
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:07,933
take it, take it all

304
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:10,694
just one chance

305
00:22:11,573 --> 00:22:14,770
the one who owns the bat and the ball

306
00:22:14,943 --> 00:22:18,037
he writes the rules and wins it all

307
00:22:21,783 --> 00:22:24,980
how long will you
keep this up this game?

308
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:30,047
Why don't you set up
a stadium of hope?

309
00:22:30,592 --> 00:22:31,957
Just one chance

310
00:22:33,762 --> 00:22:36,595
watch me as i step on the field

311
00:22:37,098 --> 00:22:39,658
watch me as i step on the field

312
00:22:40,535 --> 00:22:43,231
you will see my aspirations flying high

313
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:46,833
just give me a chance

314
00:22:47,175 --> 00:22:51,942
just give me one chance, my dear,
oh my dear

315
00:22:52,213 --> 00:22:53,771
and watch me take flight

316
00:22:53,949 --> 00:22:58,283
just give me one chance, my dear,
oh my dear

317
00:22:59,054 --> 00:22:59,611
and watch me take flight

318
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:05,553
just give me one chance, my dear,
oh my dear

319
00:23:05,994 --> 00:23:07,859
and watch me take flight

320
00:23:13,168 --> 00:23:14,760
watch me take flight

321
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,573
watch me take flight

322
00:23:22,877 --> 00:23:24,242
just one chance

323
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:38,760
panditji? What have you scored?

324
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,853
85.3%, poorbi.

325
00:23:41,062 --> 00:23:43,622
Wow! That means you are
definitely getting into engineering.

326
00:23:43,932 --> 00:23:45,763
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

327
00:23:47,235 --> 00:23:48,896
- Glory to k. K!

328
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:50,968
Congratulations, sir.

329
00:23:51,006 --> 00:23:52,166
Three new courses this year!

330
00:23:56,778 --> 00:23:58,006
- Namaskar.
- Namaste.

331
00:23:58,046 --> 00:23:59,377
You are god, sir.

332
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:02,408
My son had flunked twice but
with your help he cleared the exam.

333
00:24:02,884 --> 00:24:03,885
We feel blessed, sir.

334
00:24:03,885 --> 00:24:06,080
Now your brother, the minister,
will take care of things.

335
00:24:06,187 --> 00:24:08,087
I won't go to any college but s.t.m.

336
00:24:08,723 --> 00:24:10,953
Sir, but you're a professor at s.t.m.

337
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,820
Please use your clout.

338
00:24:13,228 --> 00:24:13,990
We'll pay any amount.

339
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:15,930
There's nothing i can do!

340
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,296
Without s.t.m. Life is meaningless.

341
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,064
He will commit suicide, sir.

342
00:24:24,305 --> 00:24:26,671
Only the minister can save him then.

343
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:31,009
Come, please come...

344
00:24:32,247 --> 00:24:33,771
hello... please sit.

345
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:37,483
Deepak kumar and kamlesh narayan.

346
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:42,016
It's my pleasure to introduce
these two newjunior lecturers.

347
00:24:43,124 --> 00:24:44,022
Go, meet them.

348
00:24:46,795 --> 00:24:47,693
Welcome...

349
00:24:50,832 --> 00:24:53,232
why are you wasting
your time here, mr. Deepak kumar?

350
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:55,696
Make use of the reservation rule.

351
00:24:56,271 --> 00:24:58,466
The government is doling outjobs
to you people in charity.

352
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,865
It's you people who've been
living on charity, sir.

353
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,178
By snatching from us
what is rightfully ours.

354
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,816
But now, when you have to give it back,
it hurts, doesn't it?

355
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,126
You are the minister for education,
you practically run the government.

356
00:25:18,126 --> 00:25:20,026
But you can't get admission
for your only nephew?

357
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:22,086
Oh stop crying, please!

358
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:24,062
I'm getting it done.

359
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:25,995
Sir, it's impossible at s.t.m.

360
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:27,166
No one can do that.

361
00:25:27,435 --> 00:25:29,104
Why is it so difficult, verma?

362
00:25:29,104 --> 00:25:32,006
Sir, over the past 35 years,
principal prabhakar anand has...

363
00:25:32,006 --> 00:25:36,344
nurtured the college in every way
on his own.

364
00:25:36,344 --> 00:25:37,746
Even the government can't interfere.

365
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:40,044
Last year, he refused admission
to the home secretary's daughter.

366
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:40,843
Really?!

367
00:25:42,317 --> 00:25:44,979
In that case,
i have to meet this principal.

368
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:49,152
Aniruddha prasad is the secretary
of the s.t.m. Trust.

369
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,959
Let's have a word with him.

370
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:51,755
Yes, please do.

371
00:25:51,993 --> 00:25:54,461
We've got more than
10,000 applications this time.

372
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:57,163
Hello...

373
00:25:58,199 --> 00:26:00,468
the first cut off list is 94%.

374
00:26:00,468 --> 00:26:02,570
Your daughter has scored 76%.

375
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,162
It's impossible, navneetji.

376
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:11,079
You've made millions
as a secretary in the government.

377
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,512
Time to put it to use.

378
00:26:12,914 --> 00:26:16,179
You can buy a seat
in any college for your daughter!

379
00:26:23,691 --> 00:26:26,023
Aniruddha has come with
the minister for education.

380
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:29,531
Baburam chaudhary,
the minister for education.

381
00:26:29,531 --> 00:26:30,293
Namaskar.

382
00:26:30,765 --> 00:26:33,668
It's great to see that you go
for a run in the morning, sir.

383
00:26:33,668 --> 00:26:36,603
No wonder that even the college
is in such terrific shape.

384
00:26:36,871 --> 00:26:38,202
What has your nephew scored?

385
00:26:38,606 --> 00:26:39,971
His score is low.

386
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:44,538
But, in any case, no one in our family
ever managed to score above 40%.

387
00:26:44,746 --> 00:26:47,015
But all thanks to k.k. Coaching...

388
00:26:47,015 --> 00:26:50,285
they made him slog
at memorising everything...

389
00:26:50,285 --> 00:26:51,809
and he scored 52.07%.

390
00:26:54,189 --> 00:26:55,816
I'm sorry but i can't help you.

391
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,118
Don't say that, sir.

392
00:26:57,826 --> 00:27:00,351
Please don't say that.
He is my sister's only son.

393
00:27:00,395 --> 00:27:04,161
He doesn't want anything except s.t.m.

394
00:27:06,067 --> 00:27:07,068
If you'll kindly excuse me...

395
00:27:07,068 --> 00:27:07,902
i have some things
to take care of.

396
00:27:07,902 --> 00:27:09,893
Aniruddha, please look after him.

397
00:27:11,139 --> 00:27:12,299
Sir, just listen to me.

398
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:16,708
Oh! So this is where you run
your private coaching.

399
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:19,109
But why are you taking
classes in your backyard?

400
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,214
I have lots of space
in my commercial complex.

401
00:27:21,249 --> 00:27:24,150
You can hold your classes there.
Your name will attract the students.

402
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:26,585
You can mint money.

403
00:27:31,993 --> 00:27:34,587
Mr. Minister, our college
pays good salaries.

404
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:41,229
Moreover, we are not allowed
to give private tuitions outside.

405
00:27:46,174 --> 00:27:48,142
You mean all this is for free?

406
00:27:48,676 --> 00:27:49,802
Please come...

407
00:27:50,979 --> 00:27:52,003
have i upset him?

408
00:27:52,113 --> 00:27:55,241
Don't worry, sir.
I'll speak with him.

409
00:27:55,283 --> 00:27:58,620
You advise people to
pay for admission outside.

410
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,714
Why not have that system
in your college?

411
00:28:07,128 --> 00:28:08,857
Mr. Minister, you?

412
00:28:09,197 --> 00:28:10,198
You should've sent for me.

413
00:28:10,198 --> 00:28:11,256
Damodar seth...

414
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:13,357
you are a senior trustee at s.t.m.

415
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:15,703
For years, i have got you
contracts worth millions...

416
00:28:15,703 --> 00:28:16,971
from the education department.

417
00:28:16,971 --> 00:28:19,064
And yet, you can't get
my nephew admitted?

418
00:28:19,173 --> 00:28:20,401
That's precisely the problem.

419
00:28:21,042 --> 00:28:23,272
The principal controls
the admissions completely.

420
00:28:23,378 --> 00:28:24,436
So that's a 'no'?

421
00:28:25,046 --> 00:28:28,641
If the boy's grade is low,
take money for the admission.

422
00:28:28,983 --> 00:28:30,644
Why are you ruining his career?

423
00:28:31,185 --> 00:28:33,187
Moreover, the college is losing millions.

424
00:28:33,187 --> 00:28:34,381
What sort of education is this?

425
00:28:34,722 --> 00:28:35,323
Don't worry.

426
00:28:35,323 --> 00:28:37,120
How can i not?

427
00:28:38,726 --> 00:28:40,284
My nephew's career is at stake.

428
00:28:40,795 --> 00:28:45,095
I'll have the chief minister call
the founder member shakuntala thakralji.

429
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:48,427
The chief minister began
his political career through her party.

430
00:28:48,903 --> 00:28:50,939
Your principal
won't be able to refuse her.

431
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:54,773
Sir, shakuntala quit everything worldly
32 years ago...

432
00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:57,312
to live in an ashram in hrishikesh.

433
00:28:57,312 --> 00:28:58,913
There's no way to contact her.

434
00:28:58,913 --> 00:29:00,039
Listen, don't worry.

435
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:02,250
I'll take care of your nephew's admission.

436
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,945
I just had a word with the chairman.

437
00:29:04,218 --> 00:29:06,482
At the next board meeting,
we'll cut the principal down to size.

438
00:29:06,988 --> 00:29:10,321
Appoint your own man there,
damodar seth.

439
00:29:10,858 --> 00:29:12,086
It will work wonders.

440
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,260
There's no business like education!

441
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,263
Paid service - without guarantee.

442
00:29:17,765 --> 00:29:22,828
Students will pay the fees through their noses
and then be responsible for their own results.

443
00:29:23,338 --> 00:29:27,342
You've reduced the trustees to nothing
more than a rubber-stamp, principal sir.

444
00:29:27,342 --> 00:29:28,376
Damodarji, the agenda...

445
00:29:28,376 --> 00:29:34,749
you have admitted 11 students with 52-55%,
just because they are ""underprivileged"".

446
00:29:34,749 --> 00:29:36,284
But, you won't accept a
single recommendation of ours.

447
00:29:36,284 --> 00:29:38,753
Damodarji, no one is rejected.

448
00:29:38,753 --> 00:29:40,755
All applications are
still under consideration.

449
00:29:40,755 --> 00:29:42,484
According to me,
they should be rejected.

450
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:44,752
Will you kindly enlighten us, why?

451
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:52,967
The 11 students you mention have
studied under very difficult circumstances...

452
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:58,371
without any facilities or coaching classes
and yet managed to get those scores.

453
00:29:59,907 --> 00:30:05,243
If you compare them to the children of ministers,
bureaucrats and rich families...

454
00:30:06,381 --> 00:30:14,516
who have access to good teachers,
schools, facilities and coaching classes...

455
00:30:15,456 --> 00:30:24,966
and yet score only 52.07%...

456
00:30:24,966 --> 00:30:28,868
pray tell, how
i can consider them as deserving.

457
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,074
Should you ever recommend
a weak but deserving student...

458
00:30:33,074 --> 00:30:34,507
i shall never disappoint you.

459
00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:38,409
That was one fine speech, principal sir.

460
00:30:39,447 --> 00:30:44,441
But s.t. M belongs to
a private trust created to...

461
00:30:44,485 --> 00:30:48,478
help the children of
our caste come up in life.

462
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:52,519
For the poor and the backward castes
there's the government.

463
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:56,154
Forgive me, damodarji.

464
00:30:57,098 --> 00:31:00,261
Your views are fatal for
the principles of s.t.m.

465
00:31:02,503 --> 00:31:05,301
S.t.m. Was established
with the sole purpose to offer...

466
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,078
the best possible education
to every deserving student...

467
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:13,980
regardless of caste,
religion, class or community.

468
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:17,916
But, if you people have decided to
go against that purpose...

469
00:31:19,053 --> 00:31:21,214
i regret to say,
i can't be with you anymore.

470
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:24,588
Prabhakarji, our views
are no different from yours.

471
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:28,930
Damodar is merely saying that
the trustee quota should be respected.

472
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:29,864
Noted.

473
00:31:29,864 --> 00:31:31,232
The next proposal is to...

474
00:31:31,232 --> 00:31:34,502
appoint a permanent vice principal
to replace kamta prasad.

475
00:31:34,502 --> 00:31:39,574
Excuse me, but why do
we have to decide on this now?

476
00:31:39,574 --> 00:31:43,510
Kamta prasad is still there.
Moreover, dinkar paswan is doing thatjob.

477
00:31:44,011 --> 00:31:45,205
Prabhakarji...

478
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,009
surely you don't intend to...

479
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:51,507
appoint dinkar paswan as
the permanent vice principal?

480
00:31:53,688 --> 00:31:57,988
There are other teachers more senior
and more qualified than him.

481
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:03,592
I propose that dr. Mithilesh singh
will be most suitable as the vice principal.

482
00:32:04,031 --> 00:32:06,261
Highly qualified and dedicated.

483
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:08,536
I support the recommendation fully.
Please call him in here.

484
00:32:08,536 --> 00:32:09,002
Ok.

485
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,077
Come in, mithileshji.

486
00:32:17,545 --> 00:32:21,538
It's our pleasure to appoint you
as the new vice principal of s.t.m.

487
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:23,575
I...

488
00:32:24,285 --> 00:32:27,311
will try my best to not disappoint you.

489
00:32:28,589 --> 00:32:29,283
Congratulations.

490
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:34,321
I'm certain that i will continue
to receive your co-operation.

491
00:32:35,396 --> 00:32:36,158
Trust me.

492
00:32:38,366 --> 00:32:41,733
Thank you very much for my nephew's
admission mr. Vice principal.

493
00:32:41,936 --> 00:32:43,597
All i want is your blessings.

494
00:32:43,938 --> 00:32:46,406
Now you just watch
how we take you to great heights.

495
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:49,644
How many coaching centres
do you operate currently, mithilesh?

496
00:32:49,644 --> 00:32:50,201
Seven, sir.

497
00:32:50,578 --> 00:32:52,513
What if we raise that to 27?

498
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:53,377
Excuse me?

499
00:32:53,648 --> 00:32:57,516
The minister will set up k.k. Coaching centers
in all his commercial complexes.

500
00:32:58,052 --> 00:32:59,110
And then in every district.

501
00:32:59,754 --> 00:33:03,212
I already have a plan for a university
on my 110 acres on agra road.

502
00:33:03,257 --> 00:33:05,691
This is the saraswati centre of education!

503
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,764
World class - medical, commerce,
engineering, i.t.

504
00:33:09,764 --> 00:33:11,595
Every bloody subject!

505
00:33:11,632 --> 00:33:13,768
The investment will be
to the tune of 12 billion rupees.

506
00:33:13,768 --> 00:33:16,498
Time for you to establish
a business empire of education.

507
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:21,776
Consider it done.
By god's grace.

508
00:33:21,776 --> 00:33:25,177
Within a year we'll
list it on the stock market.

509
00:33:25,446 --> 00:33:28,210
And then get at least 50 billion
from the public!

510
00:33:30,785 --> 00:33:33,549
God is great!

511
00:33:45,099 --> 00:33:46,293
What are you doing here?

512
00:33:47,602 --> 00:33:48,864
I'm asking you!

513
00:33:49,704 --> 00:33:52,264
I am putting my knowledge
of science to good use.

514
00:33:52,707 --> 00:33:54,709
And who will attend the
engineering college classes?

515
00:33:54,709 --> 00:33:58,236
I missed out on the admission
by a mere 1%.

516
00:33:58,846 --> 00:33:59,904
But your name was in the merit list!

517
00:34:00,214 --> 00:34:04,583
Yes, i was the last one in the merit list.

518
00:34:05,786 --> 00:34:09,017
But the complicated policy of
reservation denied me my rightful seat.

519
00:34:10,024 --> 00:34:13,187
My life is ruined.

520
00:34:13,628 --> 00:34:14,788
Relax, pandit.

521
00:34:15,796 --> 00:34:17,098
Even if you didn't get
admission into engineering...

522
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:18,827
life is meaningless!

523
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:22,169
It's either engineering or
i'll sweep the streets!

524
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:23,227
No, but...

525
00:34:25,706 --> 00:34:27,196
where did you get these?

526
00:34:27,742 --> 00:34:28,936
Sleeping pills?

527
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,744
Are you planning to commit suicide?

528
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:36,150
This guy is dangerous!
He'll send us to prison.

529
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,879
Don't let him get away.

530
00:34:40,688 --> 00:34:42,990
What's the meaning of this?
You can'tjust barge in like that.

531
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,126
Sorry sir, but this is urgent.
We are students of s.t.m.

532
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:47,194
I am principal prabhakar's daughter.

533
00:34:47,194 --> 00:34:48,829
Oh. How can i help you?

534
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:49,557
Injustice!

535
00:34:50,364 --> 00:34:53,197
I mean, you can stop this injustice.

536
00:34:53,701 --> 00:34:56,169
He had the last spot
on the admission list.

537
00:34:56,671 --> 00:34:58,901
However, since a backward caste
candidate scored higher...

538
00:34:58,939 --> 00:35:00,341
he was bumped off the list.

539
00:35:00,341 --> 00:35:01,709
I can't do anything about it.

540
00:35:01,709 --> 00:35:02,733
It's just bad luck.

541
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:03,739
Bad luck?

542
00:35:04,178 --> 00:35:06,578
Sir, his life will be destroyed.

543
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:07,748
He is contemplating suicide.

544
00:35:07,748 --> 00:35:11,052
Sorry, the rule is that
if a backward caste student scores...

545
00:35:11,052 --> 00:35:13,111
enough to compete
in the open category...

546
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:15,222
then he gets
admission through that category.

547
00:35:15,222 --> 00:35:17,918
Even if that means a
wasted seat in the reserved category?

548
00:35:18,225 --> 00:35:20,250
Those are the rules.
I can do nothing about them.

549
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:22,720
Sir, his father is
a janitor in our college.

550
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,232
He has studied
against very difficult odds.

551
00:35:25,232 --> 00:35:26,867
I do understand...

552
00:35:26,867 --> 00:35:28,302
but this is the system.

553
00:35:28,302 --> 00:35:29,904
To hell with the system, sir!

554
00:35:29,904 --> 00:35:30,233
What?

555
00:35:31,038 --> 00:35:31,972
Nothing.

556
00:35:31,972 --> 00:35:32,870
Thank you.

557
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:34,998
See, don't lose heart.

558
00:35:36,277 --> 00:35:38,312
Apply to the
padmavati institute of engineering.

559
00:35:38,312 --> 00:35:39,780
Sir, but the fees...

560
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,840
are 500,000 rupees.
Payable in advance.

561
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:44,111
Even my retirement fund...

562
00:35:44,352 --> 00:35:45,319
don't worry.

563
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:46,012
Just apply.

564
00:35:46,921 --> 00:35:47,945
You will get a scholarship.

565
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:52,690
I... i will personally recommend your case
to the dwarka das foundation.

566
00:35:53,327 --> 00:35:54,095
Sir...

567
00:35:54,095 --> 00:35:56,859
don't do that, please...

568
00:35:57,932 --> 00:35:59,923
you are god for us.

569
00:36:02,269 --> 00:36:03,293
Sushant?

570
00:36:06,006 --> 00:36:07,200
Son, what have you done?

571
00:36:07,908 --> 00:36:09,705
You've changed your stream once again?

572
00:36:09,744 --> 00:36:11,234
Dad, how does it matter?

573
00:36:11,278 --> 00:36:12,646
I want to go to jamia university.

574
00:36:12,646 --> 00:36:14,648
I have already appeared for
the entrance test.

575
00:36:14,648 --> 00:36:16,275
And you think
you will get admission there?

576
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,408
Of course, dad.

577
00:36:18,018 --> 00:36:20,782
Listen, forget about jamia
and study commerce.

578
00:36:21,021 --> 00:36:22,056
It's business that is -

579
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:23,353
dad, i don't want business.

580
00:36:24,258 --> 00:36:26,060
I want to do mass comm,
and that's it!

581
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,994
In that case,
you can forget about jamia.

582
00:36:28,462 --> 00:36:30,896
This is their admission list...

583
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:33,833
and your name doesn't feature in it.

584
00:36:35,202 --> 00:36:38,660
51.5% seats are reserved at jamia.

585
00:36:39,273 --> 00:36:43,175
And, you thought admission
would be easy there?

586
00:36:45,112 --> 00:36:46,977
But dad, i put in a lot of effort.

587
00:36:47,782 --> 00:36:49,113
Even the personal interview went well.

588
00:36:49,683 --> 00:36:53,744
Son, you can forget about
government-supported institutes.

589
00:36:54,155 --> 00:36:56,783
Reservations reign supreme over there.

590
00:37:01,424 --> 00:37:03,221
Let's make it quick.
I've three more lectures to go.

591
00:37:04,327 --> 00:37:05,487
You're late again!

592
00:37:05,562 --> 00:37:07,864
Sharma sir gave notes on quantum today.

593
00:37:07,864 --> 00:37:09,466
Check the sachchar and sachchar text.

594
00:37:09,466 --> 00:37:11,297
They have the best notes on quantum.

595
00:37:14,404 --> 00:37:15,063
What's wrong?

596
00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:17,863
Here, you take half.

597
00:37:17,974 --> 00:37:18,565
50-50.

598
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:20,272
Why are you letting go even 50%?

599
00:37:21,077 --> 00:37:23,477
Why don't you people
keep it all? 100%.

600
00:37:25,315 --> 00:37:26,145
What did you say?

601
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:28,249
You heard me.

602
00:37:35,225 --> 00:37:37,853
Finally, the historic ruling that everyone
was impatiently waiting for has been arrived.

603
00:37:37,928 --> 00:37:42,627
For 60 years, we have had 22.5% reservation for
the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.

604
00:37:42,933 --> 00:37:45,502
However, the recommendation
of the mandal commission that...

605
00:37:45,502 --> 00:37:49,973
the other backward castes be given
another 27% reservation, was under a cloud.

606
00:37:49,973 --> 00:37:52,676
Now, the supreme court has cleared that too.

607
00:37:52,676 --> 00:37:58,548
So, now the reservation in higher education
and governmentjobs will be 49.5%.

608
00:37:58,548 --> 00:38:01,117
These caste-based
reservations have caused...

609
00:38:01,117 --> 00:38:04,054
deep satisfaction as well as
severe discontent in the country.

610
00:38:04,054 --> 00:38:07,182
The so-called upper castes
are perturbed by the developments.

611
00:38:07,324 --> 00:38:10,452
This is abhay raichand with
cameraman akhilesh singh.

612
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:19,002
What do you think will happen?

613
00:38:19,002 --> 00:38:22,038
If they do our work,
we'll have to do what they were doing.

614
00:38:22,038 --> 00:38:24,674
We'll have to leave our studies
and take up shoe-polishing now!

615
00:38:24,674 --> 00:38:25,402
What else can we do?

616
00:38:25,442 --> 00:38:27,911
These are dark days.

617
00:38:27,911 --> 00:38:29,713
And so it shall be that...

618
00:38:29,713 --> 00:38:32,181
the swan will get discarded grain...

619
00:38:32,482 --> 00:38:34,109
while the crow will be fed pearls.

620
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,599
In this democracy,
everyone is meant to have equal rights.

621
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,635
We believe in merit...

622
00:38:51,635 --> 00:38:53,003
not in reservation.

623
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:58,942
- We're for merit...
against reservation!

624
00:38:59,175 --> 00:39:01,109
Brothers, these are those very people...

625
00:39:01,945 --> 00:39:05,108
who never allowed us
to even sit beside them.

626
00:39:05,515 --> 00:39:08,211
But, now that the supreme court's
decision has arrived...

627
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:15,425
they're screaming their lungs out that
everyone has equal rights in a democracy.

628
00:39:15,425 --> 00:39:17,290
Don't fall into their trap.

629
00:39:18,561 --> 00:39:21,698
If they had their way, they would
never allow any change whatsoever.

630
00:39:21,698 --> 00:39:25,259
Glory to the supreme court!

631
00:39:28,304 --> 00:39:30,670
Hail, lord mandal!

632
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:37,170
Time to pack
our bags and leave.

633
00:39:37,313 --> 00:39:38,575
Now these people will rule.

634
00:39:51,127 --> 00:39:52,116
Security...

635
00:39:53,363 --> 00:39:54,694
shut the gate and lock it.

636
00:39:54,731 --> 00:39:55,755
Lock it. Now!

637
00:39:58,802 --> 00:39:59,291
This is the problem with our country.

638
00:40:01,337 --> 00:40:04,067
Everyone has the freedom
to stage his own circus.

639
00:40:12,015 --> 00:40:14,609
They are deliberately
dancing outside our gate.

640
00:40:15,218 --> 00:40:15,707
Disgusting.

641
00:40:35,205 --> 00:40:36,536
What are they doing?

642
00:40:44,848 --> 00:40:46,475
- Close the gates.

643
00:40:47,517 --> 00:40:49,883
- Throw them out.

644
00:40:54,891 --> 00:40:56,222
Immediately send the police to s.t.m.

645
00:40:56,259 --> 00:40:58,328
Thousands of rioters
have gathered here.

646
00:40:58,328 --> 00:40:58,794
Yes... hurry!

647
00:41:00,797 --> 00:41:02,025
What is the need
to call the police, sir?

648
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:03,527
They will leave now.

649
00:41:04,367 --> 00:41:05,425
Of course, they'll leave.

650
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:07,131
Either on their own
or by getting kicked out.

651
00:41:07,403 --> 00:41:09,303
You guys don't know
any other language, anyway.

652
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:31,227
Whoever's gone out
should not come back in.

653
00:41:31,227 --> 00:41:32,888
Sushant, what are you doing?!

654
00:41:32,929 --> 00:41:34,055
Let them back in.

655
00:41:34,397 --> 00:41:35,329
You also go out...

656
00:41:35,565 --> 00:41:36,623
go dance with them.

657
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,364
Have you lost it?

658
00:41:38,468 --> 00:41:39,901
No, i haven't.

659
00:41:40,336 --> 00:41:41,997
In fact, i've finally realised that...

660
00:41:42,438 --> 00:41:45,842
for merit... against reservation!

661
00:41:45,842 --> 00:41:46,536
Hold on.

662
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:04,394
What's happening? Stop it.

663
00:42:04,394 --> 00:42:06,123
Sushant, have you gone mad?

664
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:07,130
You shut up!

665
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,324
And get out of here!!

666
00:42:10,867 --> 00:42:11,959
Don't even think about it.

667
00:42:12,635 --> 00:42:14,569
We haven't forgotten how to drive cattle!

668
00:42:15,405 --> 00:42:16,303
You will regret it.

669
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:23,341
Stop it!

670
00:42:24,214 --> 00:42:25,044
- Stop it!

671
00:42:25,181 --> 00:42:26,876
- For merit... against reservation!

672
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:28,412
Stop it!

673
00:42:28,518 --> 00:42:29,252
I said, shut up!

674
00:42:29,252 --> 00:42:30,549
- For merit... against reservation!

675
00:42:30,587 --> 00:42:31,679
- Shut up!

676
00:42:32,121 --> 00:42:33,356
Shut up!

677
00:42:33,356 --> 00:42:34,482
Shut up!

678
00:42:38,228 --> 00:42:39,991
It's okay, officer. You may leave.

679
00:42:40,029 --> 00:42:40,961
Thank you very much.

680
00:42:41,364 --> 00:42:42,456
Bring our students in.

681
00:42:43,399 --> 00:42:44,058
Come on in.

682
00:42:45,134 --> 00:42:45,691
Get inside!

683
00:42:51,274 --> 00:42:54,437
Everyone!
Gather at the assembly...

684
00:42:54,978 --> 00:42:55,376
now!

685
00:43:03,453 --> 00:43:04,545
Who called the police?

686
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:09,383
Who called the police?

687
00:43:10,093 --> 00:43:13,930
The manner in which
a riot was breaking out, i...

688
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,398
we have never needed to
call the police in this college.

689
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,094
And, without my permission
you will never do so again.

690
00:43:20,136 --> 00:43:20,536
The situation was...

691
00:43:20,536 --> 00:43:21,400
never!

692
00:43:21,571 --> 00:43:22,697
Never again!

693
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:24,035
Am i understood?

694
00:43:25,742 --> 00:43:27,039
Yes... sir.

695
00:43:30,613 --> 00:43:35,277
I will never tolerate
anyone who breaks discipline.

696
00:43:37,186 --> 00:43:42,647
I want the names of all those students
who were at the gate.

697
00:43:42,759 --> 00:43:44,659
You will never do this again!

698
00:43:45,662 --> 00:43:48,597
Today you have brought disrepute
to this institution.

699
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:51,657
Sushant seth...

700
00:43:53,436 --> 00:43:54,130
deepak kumar.

701
00:43:55,571 --> 00:43:59,007
Your irresponsible conduct
has shamed this college.

702
00:43:59,042 --> 00:43:59,667
Sir, the fault is theirs.

703
00:43:59,709 --> 00:44:02,109
Just a minute.
Listen to me!

704
00:44:02,178 --> 00:44:02,974
Sir, i...

705
00:44:03,112 --> 00:44:04,511
listen... listen to me!

706
00:44:04,714 --> 00:44:05,703
And listen carefully.

707
00:44:08,685 --> 00:44:11,483
This is my last warning to you...
and to those with you.

708
00:44:12,422 --> 00:44:15,414
I will not tolerate this hooliganism!

709
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:19,392
I won't hesitate to
expel you two from this college.

710
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,471
What is this?

711
00:44:39,515 --> 00:44:40,641
Tickets for yoga classes.

712
00:44:42,385 --> 00:44:43,374
I'm busy.

713
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,548
But, it's an evening show.

714
00:44:45,955 --> 00:44:46,478
Please...

715
00:44:54,063 --> 00:44:55,496
can't you forget what happened?

716
00:44:58,901 --> 00:44:59,333
It's a 1000-year old story, poorbi.

717
00:45:01,304 --> 00:45:03,431
Repeated everyday - a million times!

718
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,704
Even if i want to,
i'm not allowed to forget.

719
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,584
Hey! An email from cornell!

720
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,144
Your paper's been accepted!

721
00:45:20,023 --> 00:45:21,183
You're going to america!

722
00:45:22,658 --> 00:45:23,682
Congratulations.

723
00:45:26,062 --> 00:45:26,289
Thanks.

724
00:45:28,097 --> 00:45:30,588
Don't we even have the
freedom to celebrate openly?

725
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,465
Shame on us!

726
00:45:33,369 --> 00:45:35,200
It's shameful that sushant was let off!

727
00:45:35,338 --> 00:45:36,566
But we won't tolerate it anymore...

728
00:45:36,606 --> 00:45:37,373
no matter who it is.

729
00:45:37,373 --> 00:45:38,067
Shut up!

730
00:45:38,674 --> 00:45:40,505
What are you
crying revolution now for?

731
00:45:41,277 --> 00:45:43,006
The supreme court
has already created history.

732
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:45,948
No matter how much the
upper castes jump and dance now...

733
00:45:45,948 --> 00:45:48,075
no one can erase the stamp of 27%!

734
00:45:48,384 --> 00:45:49,316
It's sealed now!

735
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:52,278
They'll know tomorrow morning.
Just watch!

736
00:46:01,397 --> 00:46:04,059
Reservation is our birthright!

737
00:46:04,233 --> 00:46:05,291
Oh god!

738
00:46:05,701 --> 00:46:06,725
Who has done this?

739
00:46:08,137 --> 00:46:09,069
Who has written this?

740
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:10,603
Who has written this?!

741
00:46:11,507 --> 00:46:13,236
If you have the guts, step forward!

742
00:46:16,512 --> 00:46:18,036
These people will never get it.

743
00:46:18,781 --> 00:46:21,648
They're like cowardly snakes...
strike and scurry back into the burrow.

744
00:46:22,985 --> 00:46:24,384
Something will have to be done
about them.

745
00:46:24,987 --> 00:46:26,386
Whoever has done this,
it's not right.

746
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:29,749
Chhotu, get me a bucket of water.

747
00:46:29,992 --> 00:46:31,721
Where's the need to erase this,
mr. Deepak kumar?

748
00:46:32,061 --> 00:46:33,153
Just tweak it a little bit.

749
00:46:33,629 --> 00:46:35,620
Instead of 'reservation', write 'charity'.

750
00:46:36,466 --> 00:46:37,763
'Charity is our birthright.'

751
00:46:38,434 --> 00:46:41,665
For 60 years, we've suffered the scheduled
caste and scheduled tribe reservation.

752
00:46:42,338 --> 00:46:44,363
And now, the other backward castes!

753
00:46:45,575 --> 00:46:48,567
Our children slog throughout the year...

754
00:46:49,312 --> 00:46:52,213
but when it comes to admissions,
you just rake in the loot!

755
00:46:53,716 --> 00:46:55,343
Scared of working hard, aren't you?

756
00:46:55,818 --> 00:46:56,341
Really?!

757
00:46:58,321 --> 00:46:59,652
You'll teach us hard work, will you?

758
00:47:01,023 --> 00:47:02,513
What else have we done until now?

759
00:47:03,493 --> 00:47:05,484
If you've forgotten,
go read your history again.

760
00:47:05,695 --> 00:47:07,424
Then you'll know who slogged...

761
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,395
and who looted it
like it was their birthright.

762
00:47:09,665 --> 00:47:12,668
For centuries you people
filled up your coffers with handouts...

763
00:47:12,668 --> 00:47:14,533
and you accuse us of living on charity?

764
00:47:15,037 --> 00:47:16,197
We ploughed your fields...

765
00:47:16,772 --> 00:47:19,434
we reaped your corn,
grazed your cattle...

766
00:47:20,543 --> 00:47:22,670
we carried your daughters
and wives' palanquins...

767
00:47:24,213 --> 00:47:25,407
we cremated your corpses...

768
00:47:25,581 --> 00:47:27,446
stitched your shoes,
drove your oxen, rowed your boats...

769
00:47:27,483 --> 00:47:29,352
cleaned your filthy drains...

770
00:47:29,352 --> 00:47:31,252
and we even carried your shit on our heads.

771
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,514
And you're going to teach us hard work?

772
00:47:32,622 --> 00:47:35,113
You're absolutely right.
That's all that you're good for!

773
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:36,586
That is all you're worth.

774
00:47:36,859 --> 00:47:38,121
And you deserve to be like that.

775
00:47:38,494 --> 00:47:40,655
Here, we're talking about
building our nations' future.

776
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:43,457
And only the deserving will get a position.

777
00:47:43,633 --> 00:47:46,261
But you guys want
everything free of cost.

778
00:47:46,736 --> 00:47:49,296
The truth is that you are
scared of competition.

779
00:47:50,506 --> 00:47:52,064
Which competition are you talking about?

780
00:47:53,242 --> 00:47:55,233
The one that you
never let us participate in?

781
00:47:55,678 --> 00:47:57,771
The door of every school
was closed for us.

782
00:47:58,481 --> 00:48:01,851
And, if we got in somehow,
we were relegated to the back benches.

783
00:48:01,851 --> 00:48:04,654
You controlled all the schools...
the hospitals... police stations...

784
00:48:04,654 --> 00:48:06,451
every support system belonged to you!

785
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:11,656
Do you know why you
never let us compete?

786
00:48:12,728 --> 00:48:16,095
Because you were afraid of
a level competition... not us.

787
00:48:16,432 --> 00:48:18,559
Don't use history to
hide your weaknesses.

788
00:48:19,502 --> 00:48:21,766
Nothing of this sort happens
in our generation.

789
00:48:22,405 --> 00:48:24,873
If you have the guts,
accept the challenge and fight.

790
00:48:25,374 --> 00:48:28,275
But you won't do that.
Because, for that you need merit -

791
00:48:28,311 --> 00:48:29,744
which you clearly don't have!

792
00:48:30,446 --> 00:48:32,311
We're ready to compete with you on merit.

793
00:48:33,115 --> 00:48:36,107
But the starting line for the race
should be the same for everyone.

794
00:48:36,552 --> 00:48:40,750
First, tell your pop to vacate
his ancestral mansion and live in our slums.

795
00:48:40,923 --> 00:48:45,261
Ask him to wear a company uniform
and go to work as a driver, a doorman or a cleaner.

796
00:48:45,261 --> 00:48:48,389
Tell your mother to leave
her air-conditioned house and...

797
00:48:48,731 --> 00:48:51,325
accompany our mothers
to clean other people's homes.

798
00:48:51,801 --> 00:48:54,136
Tell your sister that, as soon as
she wakes up every morning...

799
00:48:54,136 --> 00:48:57,731
to fetch water from the municipal tap in
the neighbourhood.

800
00:48:58,741 --> 00:49:02,142
Come with us! Sample our lives.
And then lecture us!

801
00:49:02,945 --> 00:49:04,708
We will compete with you on merit too.

802
00:49:05,281 --> 00:49:06,714
But until you do all that...

803
00:49:07,483 --> 00:49:09,417
keep your ridiculous hogwash to yourself!

804
00:49:30,906 --> 00:49:34,239
In spite of the severe
last warning yesterday...

805
00:49:35,344 --> 00:49:37,437
you were misbehaving again toay.

806
00:49:39,115 --> 00:49:43,518
It's obvious that you don't respect
the code of conduct of this college.

807
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:48,652
Sushant seth, for your unruly conduct...

808
00:49:49,525 --> 00:49:50,924
i hereby rusticate you from s.t.m.

809
00:49:51,427 --> 00:49:52,519
Sir, you can't do this!

810
00:49:53,629 --> 00:49:55,392
I haven't misbehaved in any way.

811
00:49:56,098 --> 00:49:58,434
In fact, yesterday
i was just trying to stop them.

812
00:49:58,434 --> 00:49:59,594
And i was doing the same, today.

813
00:50:01,304 --> 00:50:03,306
They create a ruckus,
damage college property...

814
00:50:03,306 --> 00:50:04,295
they abuse us...

815
00:50:04,573 --> 00:50:06,598
they openly destroy s.t.m.'s reputation...

816
00:50:07,643 --> 00:50:09,235
i will not be a mute spectator in all this!

817
00:50:09,645 --> 00:50:12,671
And, since when have you been appointed
the security chief and moral guardian here?

818
00:50:13,683 --> 00:50:15,951
If you had any complaint,
why didn't you come to me?

819
00:50:15,951 --> 00:50:17,077
That would have made no difference, sir.

820
00:50:17,553 --> 00:50:20,215
You would never have taken
any action against deepak kumar.

821
00:50:20,256 --> 00:50:21,086
Everyone knows that!

822
00:50:24,193 --> 00:50:24,591
What?!

823
00:50:26,095 --> 00:50:26,959
Out!

824
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:28,124
Get out of here!

825
00:50:28,497 --> 00:50:29,054
Now!!

826
00:50:32,668 --> 00:50:36,968
Sir, even you are supporting
those people who are ruining our lives.

827
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,738
Sushant, what?

828
00:50:46,182 --> 00:50:47,376
Sushant, what happened?

829
00:50:47,483 --> 00:50:48,575
Get lost!

830
00:50:51,087 --> 00:50:55,224
Sir, i had no intention of getting
into an argument with anyone.

831
00:50:55,224 --> 00:50:57,658
Least of all with the vice principal.

832
00:50:58,561 --> 00:50:59,729
But, given the kind of remarks
that were made there...

833
00:50:59,729 --> 00:51:03,130
it became impossible for me to remain silent.

834
00:51:03,733 --> 00:51:06,224
Can i know what your compulsion was?

835
00:51:06,736 --> 00:51:07,998
My identity, sir.

836
00:51:08,437 --> 00:51:12,373
Sushant and mithileshji were
repeatedly insulting our caste... our people...

837
00:51:13,175 --> 00:51:14,073
your people?!

838
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:20,015
Since when did you begin speaking
this language of caste politics?

839
00:51:20,349 --> 00:51:21,817
You are a teacher...

840
00:51:21,817 --> 00:51:23,444
who should be above such things.

841
00:51:23,619 --> 00:51:25,553
It's easy for you to say that, sir.

842
00:51:26,088 --> 00:51:28,249
But, my birth leaves me no choice.

843
00:51:29,225 --> 00:51:31,352
For centuries,
we have endured abuses and insults.

844
00:51:32,495 --> 00:51:34,554
Now, we will not tolerate it anymore, sir!

845
00:51:35,164 --> 00:51:37,496
It is incredible that a
teacher is using such language.

846
00:51:38,768 --> 00:51:41,203
You're repeatedly violating
the discipline of s.t. M... .

847
00:51:41,203 --> 00:51:42,101
Discipline?

848
00:51:43,105 --> 00:51:46,165
Sir, our entire society is
struggling with a historic upheaval outside...

849
00:51:46,275 --> 00:51:47,833
and all you can think of is discipline?!

850
00:51:50,045 --> 00:51:52,513
You will not speak to me like this!

851
00:51:55,151 --> 00:51:55,674
Alright, sir.

852
00:51:57,787 --> 00:51:59,618
But, just answer one question of mine.

853
00:51:59,789 --> 00:52:04,055
What is your stand on
the supreme court's verdict?

854
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:05,561
I haven't called you here to debate...

855
00:52:05,561 --> 00:52:08,325
sir, you can't ignore
this question anymore.

856
00:52:09,298 --> 00:52:12,665
If you're not for reservation,
then you're against it.

857
00:52:13,235 --> 00:52:15,396
There is no safe middle ground left.

858
00:52:16,705 --> 00:52:18,138
What is your position?

859
00:52:19,408 --> 00:52:23,276
I do not have to explain
my position to you.

860
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:27,149
And for this misconduct,
i will take disciplinary...

861
00:52:27,149 --> 00:52:29,515
what else can i expect
from a place like this, sir?

862
00:52:30,553 --> 00:52:32,487
Here, i will be punished for telling the truth.

863
00:52:33,355 --> 00:52:34,723
But, no action will be taken against those...

864
00:52:34,723 --> 00:52:37,214
who flagrantly violate the rules of s.t. M!

865
00:52:37,827 --> 00:52:38,555
Look.

866
00:52:40,296 --> 00:52:41,194
Your vice principal.

867
00:52:42,198 --> 00:52:43,859
He openly runs k.k. Coaching classes.

868
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,330
He earns millions
but all his sins are forgiven, sir.

869
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:49,837
After all, his identity is different from mine!

870
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:56,577
Are you making an allegation
of casteism against me?

871
00:52:57,813 --> 00:52:59,678
Are you trying to accuse me...

872
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:02,908
of being a casteist?

873
00:53:08,657 --> 00:53:10,852
Thank you...

874
00:53:13,829 --> 00:53:16,127
for holding such an opinion of me.

875
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,132
Thank you... very very much.

876
00:53:20,903 --> 00:53:22,131
Now you may leave.

877
00:53:23,739 --> 00:53:26,867
And, never try to come before me again.

878
00:53:28,143 --> 00:53:28,700
Ever!

879
00:53:30,346 --> 00:53:30,744
So...

880
00:53:32,381 --> 00:53:32,847
leave.

881
00:53:35,518 --> 00:53:36,246
Leave!

882
00:54:29,034 --> 00:54:30,058
Why aren't you answering my calls?

883
00:54:39,578 --> 00:54:41,705
You'll have to apologise to my dad!

884
00:54:42,848 --> 00:54:45,043
Have you come here in
this rain only to tell me this?

885
00:54:45,784 --> 00:54:47,183
Who the hell do you think you are?

886
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:49,684
How dare you talk to my dad like that?

887
00:54:50,889 --> 00:54:53,687
I will not tolerate anyone hurting my dad.

888
00:54:54,293 --> 00:54:55,760
Even if it is you!

889
00:54:57,929 --> 00:54:58,725
Do you know what it means to be hurt?

890
00:55:00,966 --> 00:55:02,092
Or, do you follow the same system:

891
00:55:03,001 --> 00:55:03,899
First inflict hurt.

892
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:06,261
And, then get the victim to apologise?

893
00:55:07,339 --> 00:55:09,136
I can't believe that you are talking like this.

894
00:55:10,242 --> 00:55:13,109
Deepak kumar, whatever
you are today is because of my dad.

895
00:55:13,245 --> 00:55:14,371
You owe everything to him!

896
00:55:16,682 --> 00:55:17,410
That's true.

897
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,047
I am who i am because of him.

898
00:55:21,186 --> 00:55:23,746
And no matter what i do,
i can never repay him.

899
00:55:26,258 --> 00:55:29,193
But, today i realized
what a great burden that is.

900
00:55:31,697 --> 00:55:35,360
So, whatever my dad did for
you has now become a burden?!

901
00:55:36,768 --> 00:55:40,172
Have you forgotten those years when he
stayed up full nights preparing you for your exams?

902
00:55:40,172 --> 00:55:41,696
I haven't forgotten anything.

903
00:55:42,774 --> 00:55:44,799
But, i feel that he does all that as charity.

904
00:55:45,911 --> 00:55:48,141
And charity can't bring real change in society.

905
00:55:49,381 --> 00:55:50,643
Poorbi...

906
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:55,315
by giving a blanket to a poor man,
you might remove the poverty that is inside you.

907
00:55:56,455 --> 00:55:57,353
But, not his.

908
00:55:58,824 --> 00:56:02,021
I haven't come here
to listen to your arguments.

909
00:56:03,095 --> 00:56:04,960
Will you apologise to my dad or not?

910
00:56:09,234 --> 00:56:10,258
I'm asking you...

911
00:56:12,037 --> 00:56:13,265
will you apologise or not?

912
00:56:17,743 --> 00:56:18,368
Fine.

913
00:56:20,412 --> 00:56:21,936
Then, understand this clearly.

914
00:56:23,782 --> 00:56:25,010
I never want to see you again.

915
00:56:29,121 --> 00:56:30,281
Ever.

916
00:56:36,695 --> 00:56:39,323
Oh beautiful life

917
00:56:39,865 --> 00:56:42,163
oh beautiful life

918
00:56:42,501 --> 00:56:45,231
oh beautiful life

919
00:56:45,804 --> 00:56:47,704
oh beautiful life

920
00:56:59,484 --> 00:57:06,253
which cord do you lean on,
which cord do you sever

921
00:57:09,728 --> 00:57:15,064
this beautiful life says
why do you share me

922
00:57:18,737 --> 00:57:24,835
which cord do you lean on,
which cord do you sever

923
00:58:04,216 --> 00:58:08,550
we sowed crops with lot of effort

924
00:58:09,888 --> 00:58:13,449
we picked the best seeds of the lot

925
00:58:15,427 --> 00:58:20,797
watered the soil with a lot of care

926
00:58:21,933 --> 00:58:26,427
and that's when the sprouts smiled

927
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:33,439
fate can very cruel

928
00:58:34,012 --> 00:58:39,211
fate can very cruel

929
00:58:39,885 --> 00:58:43,582
but who can scold it

930
00:58:45,824 --> 00:58:49,988
but who can scold it

931
00:58:52,931 --> 00:58:58,130
which cord do you lean on,
which cord do you sever

932
00:58:59,304 --> 00:59:03,240
oh beautiful life

933
00:59:03,275 --> 00:59:06,039
oh beautiful life

934
00:59:06,144 --> 00:59:09,281
oh beautiful life

935
00:59:09,281 --> 00:59:11,511
oh beautiful life

936
00:59:30,669 --> 00:59:36,039
the mind seems lost in the wilderness

937
00:59:36,508 --> 00:59:40,877
leaves scattered all around

938
00:59:42,447 --> 00:59:47,544
the river is lashing against its banks

939
00:59:48,987 --> 00:59:52,445
the heart awakens from its slumber

940
00:59:54,593 --> 00:59:59,155
storms may come and go

941
01:00:00,565 --> 01:00:05,400
storms may come and go

942
01:00:06,338 --> 01:00:10,274
silence alone is eternal

943
01:00:12,477 --> 01:00:15,913
silence alone is eternal

944
01:00:19,517 --> 01:00:23,681
which cord do you lean on,
which cord do you sever...

945
01:00:27,025 --> 01:00:31,928
oh beautiful life

946
01:00:33,031 --> 01:00:35,022
oh beautiful life

947
01:00:35,734 --> 01:00:37,725
oh beautiful life

948
01:01:00,058 --> 01:01:00,786
namaste sir.

949
01:01:03,161 --> 01:01:04,719
Good morning, sir.

950
01:01:13,505 --> 01:01:14,272
Whose class is this?

951
01:01:14,272 --> 01:01:15,762
Sir, the vice principal's.

952
01:01:18,977 --> 01:01:21,036
He must be on his way.
You people read your notes until then.

953
01:01:21,112 --> 01:01:22,010
He won't come, sir.

954
01:01:23,281 --> 01:01:24,771
Sir, he rarely comes to class.

955
01:01:25,116 --> 01:01:26,981
For the last three weeks,
not even once.

956
01:01:46,071 --> 01:01:46,871
Excuse me...

957
01:01:46,871 --> 01:01:47,303
yes, sir?

958
01:01:47,338 --> 01:01:48,473
Where can i find mithilesh singh?

959
01:01:48,473 --> 01:01:49,774
Sir, in the classroom...

960
01:01:49,774 --> 01:01:50,069
there?

961
01:01:50,108 --> 01:01:50,574
Yes, sir.

962
01:01:54,779 --> 01:02:02,185
...by 12 n is equal to 416.6 mn.

963
01:02:02,253 --> 01:02:03,117
Right?

964
01:02:06,991 --> 01:02:09,084
Please look up the
answer in your 'guess' paper.

965
01:02:12,063 --> 01:02:15,829
Sir, it's actually my brother's class...
but he is ill, you see...

966
01:02:15,967 --> 01:02:20,461
i was only... tr... trying to help...

967
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:24,175
you can ask the students.

968
01:02:24,175 --> 01:02:25,233
Please report at the college.

969
01:02:26,511 --> 01:02:27,535
And come to the principal's office.

970
01:02:28,246 --> 01:02:28,905
Sir, you...

971
01:02:28,947 --> 01:02:31,177
come to the principal's office.

972
01:02:37,255 --> 01:02:40,315
Prabhakar, please think
calmly before you take any action.

973
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:48,292
In brazen violation
of the rules of this college...

974
01:02:49,267 --> 01:02:53,499
you are running a commercial
coaching institute, mithilesh singh.

975
01:02:54,305 --> 01:02:57,240
You're the victim of a misunderstanding, sir.

976
01:02:57,275 --> 01:03:02,338
First of all, k.k. Coaching
which you visited this morning...

977
01:03:02,547 --> 01:03:03,878
doesn't belong to me.

978
01:03:04,282 --> 01:03:05,408
It belongs to my cousin...

979
01:03:06,217 --> 01:03:07,081
krishna kumar...

980
01:03:07,652 --> 01:03:09,017
k. K.

981
01:03:09,888 --> 01:03:10,877
And, second...

982
01:03:11,856 --> 01:03:14,484
even you run a coaching
class in your back verandah.

983
01:03:15,994 --> 01:03:17,894
People like you won't
understand the difference.

984
01:03:18,963 --> 01:03:21,900
I run classes in my verandah because...

985
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:26,496
in our college, we are unable
to offer special help to our weak students.

986
01:03:26,538 --> 01:03:27,664
Whereas teachers like you...

987
01:03:28,506 --> 01:03:29,996
deliberately miss lectures and thereby...

988
01:03:30,575 --> 01:03:35,512
force students to take private
commercial coaching for your profit.

989
01:03:36,981 --> 01:03:39,313
And that, mr. Mithilesh singh,
is the difference!

990
01:03:41,286 --> 01:03:44,881
I work for the college.
Whereas you...

991
01:03:45,256 --> 01:03:46,587
work against it.

992
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,360
You are being served
with a 'show-cause' notice.

993
01:03:54,666 --> 01:03:57,260
In seven days, explain why you
shouldn't be suspended from the college.

994
01:03:57,402 --> 01:03:57,936
Prabhakar...

995
01:03:57,936 --> 01:03:58,402
seven days!

996
01:03:59,637 --> 01:04:00,626
In seven days, i want an answer.

997
01:04:05,009 --> 01:04:06,340
You will get your answer.

998
01:04:10,014 --> 01:04:10,946
Most certainly.

999
01:04:12,483 --> 01:04:16,010
Dr. Prabhakar anand... sir.

1000
01:04:23,094 --> 01:04:24,652
Prabhakar, what are you doing?

1001
01:04:26,331 --> 01:04:28,322
That, which your board
hasn't for the last 11 years.

1002
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,725
If you people had approved
my proposal for remedial classes...

1003
01:04:32,403 --> 01:04:37,175
and had organized free
coaching for our weaker students...

1004
01:04:37,175 --> 01:04:39,109
we wouldn't have had
monsters like k.k. Coaching!

1005
01:04:40,578 --> 01:04:44,708
You're well aware of how these people
are swallowing up our entire education system.

1006
01:04:44,949 --> 01:04:47,713
But, what you propose is
not feasible either, prabhakar.

1007
01:04:48,219 --> 01:04:49,345
And, you know it.

1008
01:04:50,421 --> 01:04:53,982
Morever, s.t.m. Is a private college.
Why, even the government doesn't do that!

1009
01:04:54,492 --> 01:04:55,584
Then why doesn't it?!

1010
01:04:56,394 --> 01:05:00,728
Why isn't it investing most
on its most valuable asset... education?

1011
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,302
In this country, we make the
i.a.s., indian foreign service...

1012
01:05:04,302 --> 01:05:08,705
medical, management, engineering
and every such career so attractive!

1013
01:05:08,773 --> 01:05:12,072
But, that which prepares
students for all these, is totally neglected!

1014
01:05:12,644 --> 01:05:14,312
Like i.f. S and i.a. S...

1015
01:05:14,312 --> 01:05:17,645
why don't we have an
i.t.s. - Indian teaching services...

1016
01:05:17,749 --> 01:05:19,341
to attract the best talent for the job!

1017
01:05:21,619 --> 01:05:26,079
Aniruddha, this parallel education system...

1018
01:05:27,292 --> 01:05:31,319
which thrives on capitation
and private coaching...

1019
01:05:31,729 --> 01:05:32,718
will destroy everything!

1020
01:05:45,643 --> 01:05:50,214
Sir, first you rusticated sushant seth,
and now vice principal mithilesh singh.

1021
01:05:50,214 --> 01:05:51,772
He has alleged that you...

1022
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,713
dad, mithilesh sir had
called a press conference...

1023
01:05:58,156 --> 01:05:59,953
where he said some
very nasty things against you.

1024
01:05:59,991 --> 01:06:03,051
I think that is why the editor
of dainik bhaskar, arvind kamal is here.

1025
01:06:03,594 --> 01:06:04,253
He's inside.

1026
01:06:05,163 --> 01:06:08,326
Your vice principal mithilesh singh
has accused you of being autocratic.

1027
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:12,135
And alleged that when he opposed this,
you suspended him.

1028
01:06:12,236 --> 01:06:13,037
He's lying!

1029
01:06:13,037 --> 01:06:14,061
Please, my dear...

1030
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:18,740
i haven't suspended him yet.

1031
01:06:20,178 --> 01:06:22,874
For regularly breaking the college's rules,
i've issued him a show-cause notice.

1032
01:06:23,281 --> 01:06:24,578
Which rules has he broken?

1033
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:31,779
Mr. Arvind kamal, i don't consider it appropriate
to explain my disciplinary actions...

1034
01:06:32,256 --> 01:06:34,121
through a newspaper.

1035
01:06:35,126 --> 01:06:36,821
But, his allegation is
very serious, prabhakar sir.

1036
01:06:37,195 --> 01:06:40,062
S.t.m. Is a private college
where the rule of reservation doesn't apply.

1037
01:06:41,299 --> 01:06:42,596
But, according to him...

1038
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,697
your admission policy is doing precisely that.

1039
01:06:45,703 --> 01:06:48,001
You declare a high cut-off percentage but...

1040
01:06:48,206 --> 01:06:50,834
admit backward caste
students through the backdoor, so to say.

1041
01:06:51,342 --> 01:06:52,274
See, i am a teacher.

1042
01:06:53,644 --> 01:06:56,238
My responsibility
towards each child is the same.

1043
01:06:57,215 --> 01:07:02,320
Proud as i am of my
successful and privileged students...

1044
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:03,621
i am equally concerned
about the weaker and...

1045
01:07:03,621 --> 01:07:05,885
poor students of our society.

1046
01:07:07,158 --> 01:07:11,959
Two indias co-exist in our country...

1047
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:14,024
mr. Arvind kamal.

1048
01:07:15,333 --> 01:07:18,427
And, if we want our country
to genuinely progress, then...

1049
01:07:18,903 --> 01:07:21,667
we shall have to eliminate
the gap between the two.

1050
01:07:22,006 --> 01:07:24,770
But, is caste-based
reservation the only way to do so?

1051
01:07:25,376 --> 01:07:28,046
Well, if we believe that,
for centuries...

1052
01:07:28,046 --> 01:07:29,847
injustice has been caused because
of caste-discrimination...

1053
01:07:29,847 --> 01:07:32,816
then justice should also
be served bearing caste in mind.

1054
01:07:33,151 --> 01:07:36,211
But what about those children
who have never believed in casteism?

1055
01:07:36,421 --> 01:07:38,787
Who have achieved good
results through hard work?

1056
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:43,126
But, who now may not get admission
because of this new reservation policy!

1057
01:07:47,165 --> 01:07:48,860
Today, every teacher, every college...

1058
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,891
as well as the
government is facing a big challenge.

1059
01:07:53,037 --> 01:07:56,040
On the one hand, they have
to give due opportunities to the...

1060
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:58,372
backward castes,
and encourage their talent.

1061
01:07:59,143 --> 01:08:02,271
But, on the other hand, they have
to be sensitive to the plight of those students...

1062
01:08:03,014 --> 01:08:06,142
who feel they are at a
disadvantage in this new scenario.

1063
01:08:06,717 --> 01:08:09,311
It is evident that you support
the supreme court's ruling.

1064
01:08:11,722 --> 01:08:14,282
I cannot answer that question in the words...

1065
01:08:15,827 --> 01:08:18,193
that you expect me to!

1066
01:08:19,230 --> 01:08:20,331
However, i will say that if...

1067
01:08:20,331 --> 01:08:24,927
we accept this decision in all honesty,
without making a political issue of it...

1068
01:08:24,969 --> 01:08:26,231
then it will benefit our society.

1069
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:28,304
So, would you want this
reservation policy to be implemented in...

1070
01:08:28,406 --> 01:08:30,966
private colleges and institutions as well?

1071
01:08:31,476 --> 01:08:32,340
Like s.t.m., for instance?

1072
01:08:34,712 --> 01:08:36,805
I don't have the right to comment on this.

1073
01:08:37,115 --> 01:08:37,740
Thank you.

1074
01:08:38,716 --> 01:08:41,276
Dad, don't you feel that
this reservation policy will prove harmful?

1075
01:08:43,387 --> 01:08:44,479
What're you trying to say?

1076
01:08:45,323 --> 01:08:47,450
You say that the backward castes
will get a chance to improve their lot...

1077
01:08:48,493 --> 01:08:49,926
that it'll reduce the gap between us...

1078
01:08:51,395 --> 01:08:52,327
it'll create equality...

1079
01:08:54,265 --> 01:08:55,892
but, the fact is that distances are increasing.

1080
01:08:57,301 --> 01:08:59,098
People are becoming
enemies of one another.

1081
01:09:02,273 --> 01:09:03,433
That is indeed unfortunate, my dear...

1082
01:09:04,108 --> 01:09:05,973
but it's bound to happen, i'm afraid.

1083
01:09:07,011 --> 01:09:09,070
Whenever change has
come about in a society...

1084
01:09:10,381 --> 01:09:12,212
a price has had to be paid for it.

1085
01:09:26,464 --> 01:09:28,898
How can you be
so sure that you are right?

1086
01:09:29,934 --> 01:09:32,402
What could be wrong about
providing equal opportunity to everyone?

1087
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:33,368
It is wrong!

1088
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:35,432
Your method is wrong.

1089
01:09:37,275 --> 01:09:37,866
Meaning?

1090
01:09:38,442 --> 01:09:40,774
If you really want the
backward castes to progress...

1091
01:09:41,145 --> 01:09:43,204
then give them the best
possible primary education.

1092
01:09:43,414 --> 01:09:44,916
Build special schools for them...

1093
01:09:44,916 --> 01:09:46,144
big hostels...

1094
01:09:46,184 --> 01:09:47,048
offer scholarships...

1095
01:09:47,385 --> 01:09:51,287
provide them every facility
and train them to compete!

1096
01:09:53,024 --> 01:09:54,821
Why have this... policy of reservation?!

1097
01:09:56,494 --> 01:09:59,429
What you're recommending
should be done in any case.

1098
01:10:00,097 --> 01:10:03,589
But, that is precisely what
we haven't done in 60 years.

1099
01:10:04,368 --> 01:10:05,995
Hence, reservation
becomes even more essential.

1100
01:10:07,838 --> 01:10:12,241
That section of our population,
which is backward simply because of their caste...

1101
01:10:12,843 --> 01:10:15,175
must surely be given a
small window of opportunity!

1102
01:10:15,313 --> 01:10:16,473
Look here, i'm a mother.

1103
01:10:17,181 --> 01:10:18,148
Not mother india!

1104
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:22,217
So, first and foremost i will
be concerned about my own child.

1105
01:10:22,253 --> 01:10:23,379
That is my duty!

1106
01:10:23,821 --> 01:10:27,848
For me, if a rule threatens her future,
then it is just plain wrong.

1107
01:10:28,459 --> 01:10:29,016
That's it!

1108
01:10:35,062 --> 01:10:35,756
Is that so?

1109
01:10:36,397 --> 01:10:37,056
Thank you!

1110
01:10:40,334 --> 01:10:41,995
The ploy worked perfectly, mithilesh.

1111
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:46,101
The principal made a
statement in support of reservation.

1112
01:10:47,341 --> 01:10:48,968
Now you just watch.

1113
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:52,702
If he is not reduced to begging on the streets,
you can change my name!

1114
01:10:53,414 --> 01:10:57,451
But, i don't think you
should take this reservation policy lightly.

1115
01:10:57,451 --> 01:10:59,783
Baburam sir, it won't
make a jot of a difference.

1116
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:03,586
When seats in the open category decrease,
competition will increase.

1117
01:11:03,924 --> 01:11:06,694
And, that is when people will turn
to coaching and private colleges.

1118
01:11:06,694 --> 01:11:09,686
This is 'shining' india!

1119
01:11:10,131 --> 01:11:11,365
Here people of high society...

1120
01:11:11,365 --> 01:11:12,466
are willing to pay any high cost...

1121
01:11:12,466 --> 01:11:14,058
for higher education!

1122
01:11:15,136 --> 01:11:17,331
Moreover, the reservation
rule may get these people admission.

1123
01:11:18,005 --> 01:11:22,908
But, to move ahead in that
too they'll need to spend big money!

1124
01:11:24,879 --> 01:11:26,369
Cheers!

1125
01:11:33,721 --> 01:11:34,119
What is this?

1126
01:11:34,155 --> 01:11:35,850
S.t.m. Should have reservation:
Dr. Prabhakar anand

1127
01:11:41,495 --> 01:11:42,393
those words aren't mine.

1128
01:11:43,397 --> 01:11:45,922
You mean you didn't say
that you support reservation?

1129
01:11:48,035 --> 01:11:53,174
As a teacher, i did express
my personal opinion. But s.t. M...

1130
01:11:53,174 --> 01:11:53,731
personal?!

1131
01:11:54,775 --> 01:11:58,575
Your opinions are personal
as long as you don't speak.

1132
01:11:59,080 --> 01:11:59,739
You're the voice of s.t.m.

1133
01:12:00,147 --> 01:12:04,379
Whatever you say will
be taken as s.t.m.'s policy!

1134
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:08,411
You'll have to retract
this statement, prabhakar.

1135
01:12:09,423 --> 01:12:12,881
That you support reservation -
you'll have to withdraw that opinion.

1136
01:12:16,397 --> 01:12:18,957
I don't consider it necessary
to do any such thing, aniruddha.

1137
01:12:21,702 --> 01:12:22,964
Whatever i said...

1138
01:12:24,505 --> 01:12:26,097
has deep thought and my conviction.

1139
01:12:26,207 --> 01:12:27,674
You are misunderstanding this.

1140
01:12:28,042 --> 01:12:29,669
Oh, we've misunderstood him
alright all this while.

1141
01:12:30,177 --> 01:12:31,007
But tell him...

1142
01:12:31,445 --> 01:12:32,742
politics won't be allowed in this college.

1143
01:12:33,914 --> 01:12:35,814
I was thrown out of college, i kept quiet.

1144
01:12:36,517 --> 01:12:38,075
But this deceit won't be tolerated.

1145
01:12:40,821 --> 01:12:44,825
They'll cancel our seats
and insert a quota system here too.

1146
01:12:44,825 --> 01:12:47,995
I think we should speak
with prabhakarji once.

1147
01:12:47,995 --> 01:12:50,463
Chairman sir, what is left to be discussed?

1148
01:12:50,564 --> 01:12:53,467
Call for an emergency meeting of
the trust and get rid of this arrogant fellow!

1149
01:12:53,467 --> 01:12:54,058
We've had enough!

1150
01:12:54,101 --> 01:12:57,638
Damodarji, a big action like
this will impact s.t.m.'s reputation too.

1151
01:12:57,638 --> 01:12:59,740
Why can't you people
see that he is playing politics?

1152
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:00,241
Damodarji...

1153
01:13:00,241 --> 01:13:03,644
listen, let me try to
speak with him one more time.

1154
01:13:03,644 --> 01:13:04,906
Yes, that'll be best.

1155
01:13:05,012 --> 01:13:05,671
Yes, sunny?

1156
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:10,578
When did this happen?

1157
01:13:13,187 --> 01:13:15,178
Take care of your mother.
I'm coming across.

1158
01:13:46,454 --> 01:13:47,944
Not as a trustee today...

1159
01:13:50,191 --> 01:13:51,920
but i'm speaking as a friend.

1160
01:13:54,295 --> 01:13:57,321
Till date, i've never
insisted on anything with you.

1161
01:13:59,033 --> 01:13:59,465
But, today for once...

1162
01:14:01,168 --> 01:14:02,692
just for once, please do what i ask.

1163
01:14:04,672 --> 01:14:08,073
On monday, there's an
emergency meeting of trustees at 10 a.m.

1164
01:14:09,977 --> 01:14:12,673
I've drafted a brief
clarification on your behalf.

1165
01:14:14,982 --> 01:14:16,347
Please sign it.

1166
01:14:19,587 --> 01:14:20,485
Please!

1167
01:14:32,199 --> 01:14:35,436
Prabhakarji, this statement of yours
has put our college in a serious situation.

1168
01:14:35,436 --> 01:14:38,132
What is your agenda?
To support reservations?

1169
01:14:39,573 --> 01:14:42,565
The newspaper printed
that statement out of context.

1170
01:14:43,544 --> 01:14:46,604
The principal is retracting his statement.

1171
01:15:07,301 --> 01:15:09,201
It is my good fortune that
i had the opportunity to...

1172
01:15:11,438 --> 01:15:18,571
serve shakuntala thakral college
for 35 years.

1173
01:15:19,613 --> 01:15:20,807
However, it is clear now that...

1174
01:15:24,618 --> 01:15:26,210
your love...

1175
01:15:27,821 --> 01:15:29,118
and your trust...

1176
01:15:32,393 --> 01:15:34,418
is no longer available to me.

1177
01:15:36,697 --> 01:15:38,130
It is time for me to move on now.

1178
01:15:40,601 --> 01:15:44,662
Thank you and...

1179
01:15:47,474 --> 01:15:48,202
my best wishes.

1180
01:15:56,817 --> 01:15:57,545
Prabhakar...

1181
01:16:38,492 --> 01:16:40,551
the board has appointed
mithilesh singh as the principal, sir.

1182
01:16:41,695 --> 01:16:42,787
He will destroy everything, sir.

1183
01:16:44,698 --> 01:16:47,565
Sir! Please don't go.

1184
01:16:51,572 --> 01:16:52,664
Please come, mithileshji.

1185
01:16:54,908 --> 01:16:56,273
You've come at the right time.

1186
01:16:57,478 --> 01:17:01,710
I personally wanted to
welcome you to the principal's chair.

1187
01:17:02,916 --> 01:17:04,440
Thank you. Thank you.

1188
01:17:05,219 --> 01:17:09,349
But this chair's tenure has ended
with yours, dr. Prabhakar anand.

1189
01:17:10,858 --> 01:17:12,587
I'm calling for a new chair!

1190
01:17:13,761 --> 01:17:14,591
Sure... whatever.

1191
01:17:15,729 --> 01:17:18,465
I hope that you'll take
s.t.m. To even greater heights.

1192
01:17:18,465 --> 01:17:19,833
My best wishes are with you.

1193
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:20,822
Certainly!

1194
01:17:21,368 --> 01:17:26,567
And it is also certain that
i'll never let it fall from those heights.

1195
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:46,037
Neither of them is answering their phone.

1196
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:51,313
We can'tjust suddenly ask
them to vacate the house.

1197
01:18:53,188 --> 01:18:55,588
But, surely they can arrange
an alternative in a week or so.

1198
01:19:00,262 --> 01:19:02,025
Dad, this is the street.

1199
01:19:02,998 --> 01:19:04,488
Look, there's shambhu's stable!

1200
01:19:10,839 --> 01:19:12,274
Greetings, guruji.

1201
01:19:12,274 --> 01:19:13,571
Yes, greetings...

1202
01:19:14,643 --> 01:19:16,133
guruji, what's the matter?
All this luggage?

1203
01:19:16,845 --> 01:19:21,043
Yes, we had to come to
our house all of a sudden... but...

1204
01:19:21,383 --> 01:19:24,284
that is your house! B 47.

1205
01:19:24,352 --> 01:19:28,379
But some people put up
these signboards last night.

1206
01:19:29,291 --> 01:19:30,280
I don't know...

1207
01:19:35,864 --> 01:19:37,065
sir, one minute, sir...

1208
01:19:37,065 --> 01:19:39,226
get away!

1209
01:19:43,271 --> 01:19:44,203
What's going on here?

1210
01:19:47,008 --> 01:19:48,407
K.k. Coaching in my house?!

1211
01:19:48,944 --> 01:19:49,638
How can you?

1212
01:19:50,145 --> 01:19:50,873
Get out of here right now!

1213
01:19:52,414 --> 01:19:53,346
C'mon, get out!

1214
01:19:56,017 --> 01:19:56,415
Hello...

1215
01:19:57,285 --> 01:19:59,150
sir, prabhakar uncle is here...

1216
01:19:59,654 --> 01:20:00,586
i'm coming.

1217
01:20:00,622 --> 01:20:01,554
Don't worry.

1218
01:20:03,325 --> 01:20:05,156
...and that is the centre of gravity.

1219
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:06,288
Wow!

1220
01:20:07,262 --> 01:20:08,296
How could you people do this?

1221
01:20:08,296 --> 01:20:09,531
But, for two years you had...

1222
01:20:09,531 --> 01:20:10,899
where's your mother?

1223
01:20:10,899 --> 01:20:13,101
We've rented a place to live...

1224
01:20:13,101 --> 01:20:15,126
and started a coaching
centre in our house?! Great!

1225
01:20:16,505 --> 01:20:17,904
Aren't you students of s.t. M?

1226
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:20,269
I want everybody out of here.
Everybody!

1227
01:20:20,909 --> 01:20:21,376
Uncle...

1228
01:20:21,376 --> 01:20:22,206
you just shut up!

1229
01:20:23,245 --> 01:20:25,907
You have perhaps
no idea what you've done!

1230
01:20:32,387 --> 01:20:33,183
Come...

1231
01:20:33,688 --> 01:20:34,916
what happened? This?

1232
01:20:40,662 --> 01:20:41,094
You??

1233
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:44,022
You had better stay out of this house!

1234
01:20:44,432 --> 01:20:44,989
Me?

1235
01:20:46,601 --> 01:20:48,937
It is not me, but you
who will go out of the house.

1236
01:20:48,937 --> 01:20:51,531
See, these are my
business premises, dr. Prabhakar anand.

1237
01:20:51,573 --> 01:20:52,699
And you are creating a nuisance here.

1238
01:20:53,375 --> 01:20:56,044
You had said that we
could be here for two years.

1239
01:20:56,044 --> 01:20:58,308
Two years? What nonsense!!

1240
01:20:58,947 --> 01:21:02,178
In friendship, to offer you support
we gave you this house.

1241
01:21:03,118 --> 01:21:05,052
And you betrayed us!

1242
01:21:06,421 --> 01:21:07,718
Kamta and i...

1243
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:10,492
fought against commercial coaching,
all our lives.

1244
01:21:10,492 --> 01:21:12,050
And here in my own
house you have k.k. Coaching?

1245
01:21:12,294 --> 01:21:13,352
So, what could i do?

1246
01:21:13,562 --> 01:21:15,757
He kept struggling with you...
but to what end?

1247
01:21:16,097 --> 01:21:17,689
Couldn't even build a house for himself.

1248
01:21:18,366 --> 01:21:21,392
You did give us shelter,
but we had no earnings.

1249
01:21:22,270 --> 01:21:26,575
Thank god for mithileshji
that he showed a way to my sons...

1250
01:21:26,575 --> 01:21:28,770
to earn a living and save...

1251
01:21:28,977 --> 01:21:31,446
so, do whatever you
wish to in your rented place?

1252
01:21:31,446 --> 01:21:32,208
Why are you using our house?

1253
01:21:32,247 --> 01:21:33,509
Enough! Enough!

1254
01:21:33,582 --> 01:21:35,709
Stop this family court drama.

1255
01:21:36,351 --> 01:21:37,682
Whoever wants to go wherever, please do.

1256
01:21:38,086 --> 01:21:39,986
For two years this place is ours.

1257
01:21:40,789 --> 01:21:43,622
So, please don't disturb k.k. Coaching classes.
Now, please...

1258
01:21:47,062 --> 01:21:50,190
will you show yourself out or...
should i help?

1259
01:21:52,434 --> 01:21:53,992
Don't you dare touch my dad.

1260
01:21:54,069 --> 01:21:54,728
Get away!

1261
01:21:55,003 --> 01:21:56,163
Let go!

1262
01:21:56,504 --> 01:21:58,267
You don't know who i am!

1263
01:22:00,408 --> 01:22:02,137
Even if you so much as touch our guruji...

1264
01:22:02,344 --> 01:22:03,011
shambhu...

1265
01:22:03,011 --> 01:22:03,568
no, guruji...

1266
01:22:03,812 --> 01:22:05,336
i'll finish them off!

1267
01:22:05,447 --> 01:22:06,141
Shambhu!

1268
01:22:07,582 --> 01:22:09,345
Who do you guys think you are?

1269
01:22:10,018 --> 01:22:11,349
You don't scare me!

1270
01:22:12,087 --> 01:22:16,421
Just that i do not believe in
and practice violence, does not mean that...

1271
01:22:20,228 --> 01:22:22,128
this house is ours,
and we won't leave.

1272
01:22:22,297 --> 01:22:22,626
Shambhu...

1273
01:22:23,732 --> 01:22:26,030
if you have the local
police station's number, then please...

1274
01:22:26,701 --> 01:22:28,100
yes...
please come soon.

1275
01:22:28,370 --> 01:22:29,394
B 47.

1276
01:22:29,738 --> 01:22:30,500
Okay.

1277
01:22:30,805 --> 01:22:32,272
Guruji, in fact i was calling them.

1278
01:22:32,307 --> 01:22:35,037
Station in-charge thakur is on his way.

1279
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:37,205
Call anyone you want to
dr. Prabhakar anand.

1280
01:22:37,646 --> 01:22:38,840
You can't do a thing.

1281
01:22:41,149 --> 01:22:44,380
See mithileshji, we don't
want to fight with anyone.

1282
01:22:44,819 --> 01:22:46,377
We'll leave from here.

1283
01:22:47,489 --> 01:22:49,184
Yeah sure. You may happily leave.

1284
01:22:49,224 --> 01:22:50,851
But before that, let's just square up.

1285
01:22:51,059 --> 01:22:53,361
2.5 million for setting
up this centre overnight.

1286
01:22:53,361 --> 01:22:55,830
I transferred 186 students here...

1287
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:58,628
their advance fee of 9.3 million...

1288
01:22:58,667 --> 01:23:02,370
how much is that? Yes, 11.8 million.
Just pay that.

1289
01:23:02,370 --> 01:23:04,395
When did we take
any money from you?

1290
01:23:05,807 --> 01:23:07,502
You've signed a contract!

1291
01:23:08,243 --> 01:23:10,177
K.k. Coaching is
perfect with all paperwork.

1292
01:23:14,783 --> 01:23:15,647
Inspector, this way, please.

1293
01:23:16,084 --> 01:23:18,075
There's a limit to misbehaviour.

1294
01:23:18,386 --> 01:23:19,853
This way please...

1295
01:23:20,088 --> 01:23:21,248
look here.

1296
01:23:23,892 --> 01:23:24,688
Principal sir?

1297
01:23:28,096 --> 01:23:29,859
Sir, i'm station in-charge shaktinath thakur...

1298
01:23:30,598 --> 01:23:31,656
you may not recognize me.

1299
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:35,292
Elder brother of your student,
bhaktinath thakur. He's a police officer now.

1300
01:23:37,372 --> 01:23:38,464
See, inspector, this house is ours.

1301
01:23:40,241 --> 01:23:42,110
Today, when we came here to move-in...

1302
01:23:42,110 --> 01:23:44,408
we saw that these people
have started a coaching centre here.

1303
01:23:44,546 --> 01:23:45,103
Really?

1304
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:46,748
People broke in?

1305
01:23:46,748 --> 01:23:48,340
Hey! See who these people are.

1306
01:23:48,483 --> 01:23:49,711
- Round them up.
- Yes, sir.

1307
01:23:50,452 --> 01:23:50,918
Come...

1308
01:23:51,353 --> 01:23:54,189
mithilesh-babu? You, here?

1309
01:23:54,189 --> 01:23:54,712
Sir...

1310
01:23:55,323 --> 01:23:56,654
my son goes to his coaching centre.

1311
01:23:57,292 --> 01:23:58,657
You're wasting your time, inspector.

1312
01:23:59,127 --> 01:24:00,428
Nobody broke into this house.

1313
01:24:00,428 --> 01:24:04,558
On his own, he gave it to
these kids to reside and run a business.

1314
01:24:05,567 --> 01:24:06,192
Is this true?

1315
01:24:07,202 --> 01:24:09,363
Yes... for two years.

1316
01:24:09,404 --> 01:24:10,438
They're lying!

1317
01:24:10,438 --> 01:24:11,700
We merely allowed them to stay here.

1318
01:24:11,806 --> 01:24:12,431
Just a minute...

1319
01:24:13,308 --> 01:24:13,637
sir...

1320
01:24:14,909 --> 01:24:17,901
who among these broke into your house?

1321
01:24:18,279 --> 01:24:20,747
Just name them and
i'll throw them out right now.

1322
01:24:22,384 --> 01:24:23,214
See, inspector...

1323
01:24:25,286 --> 01:24:29,723
to help my friend kamta prasad's sons,
i allowed them to stay here.

1324
01:24:30,158 --> 01:24:31,853
Not to set up a
coaching center with him.

1325
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:35,720
Oh, so nobody forced their way in?

1326
01:24:36,831 --> 01:24:40,935
In that case, sir, it's a civil matter,
not a police case.

1327
01:24:40,935 --> 01:24:42,570
But this house is ours!

1328
01:24:42,570 --> 01:24:43,662
That's what i am trying to say, sir.

1329
01:24:44,439 --> 01:24:46,304
It has become an issue
of property and possession.

1330
01:24:47,242 --> 01:24:48,334
Hire a lawyer immediately.

1331
01:24:48,943 --> 01:24:53,782
Sir, senior advocate madan mohan pandey
is an ace in these matters.

1332
01:24:53,782 --> 01:24:56,683
Trust me, he is the right person
to deal with mithilesh singh.

1333
01:24:56,985 --> 01:24:59,476
I'll have a word with him.

1334
01:25:10,765 --> 01:25:12,434
You people settle down in the room.

1335
01:25:12,434 --> 01:25:13,696
I will go meet the lawyer.

1336
01:25:18,473 --> 01:25:22,811
Thank you very much, sir,
for seeing me at such short notice.

1337
01:25:22,811 --> 01:25:24,210
No, no, it's okay...

1338
01:25:25,346 --> 01:25:27,337
actually, i couldn't
understand clearly over the phone.

1339
01:25:27,782 --> 01:25:29,909
Did you sign any
agreement with those people?

1340
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:30,712
No.

1341
01:25:31,352 --> 01:25:33,217
I didn't sign any agreement
for my house.

1342
01:25:34,222 --> 01:25:35,211
It's my friend's family.

1343
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:37,323
I helped them since i trusted them.

1344
01:25:37,992 --> 01:25:41,758
But, they signed a
contract with mithilesh singh...

1345
01:25:41,963 --> 01:25:43,487
to run a coaching centre there.

1346
01:25:44,833 --> 01:25:46,323
Mithilesh singh - the k.k. Coaching person?

1347
01:25:47,235 --> 01:25:49,465
Both my sons studied at his coaching centre!

1348
01:25:50,371 --> 01:25:52,805
He is a very intelligent person.
Very sharp.

1349
01:25:53,541 --> 01:25:55,566
He never does anything foolish.

1350
01:25:56,644 --> 01:25:57,736
But, i know him personally.

1351
01:25:57,946 --> 01:25:58,970
We can talk with him.

1352
01:25:59,347 --> 01:26:00,939
But, what will we talk about?

1353
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:05,344
Prabhakarji, i mean we
can work out a compromise.

1354
01:26:06,054 --> 01:26:08,389
Mr. Advocate, i haven't come here
to work out a compromise.

1355
01:26:08,389 --> 01:26:09,253
I want my house.

1356
01:26:10,058 --> 01:26:11,252
Of course, of course!

1357
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:14,488
We can file a civil suit for eviction.

1358
01:26:15,697 --> 01:26:19,394
But, mr. Prabhakar, you know very well
how long the court's decision takes.

1359
01:26:19,434 --> 01:26:20,635
Could even take years.

1360
01:26:20,635 --> 01:26:21,533
And then, there are expenses.

1361
01:26:22,670 --> 01:26:24,272
Listen to me...

1362
01:26:24,272 --> 01:26:25,796
i'll arrange for a meeting with mithileshji.

1363
01:26:26,274 --> 01:26:27,571
I'll fix it for tomorrow itself.

1364
01:26:27,909 --> 01:26:31,367
You don't you worry.
He's a very reasonable man.

1365
01:26:35,383 --> 01:26:38,614
Thank you very much,
madan mohanji.

1366
01:26:55,170 --> 01:26:57,104
When else will we be of help, sir.

1367
01:26:57,505 --> 01:26:58,904
When we are here,
why should you live in a hotel?

1368
01:27:00,275 --> 01:27:01,476
Please bhabhiji [sister-in-law],
please pack your stuff.

1369
01:27:01,476 --> 01:27:02,610
You people will stay in my house.

1370
01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:04,237
Thank you, dinkar.

1371
01:27:04,579 --> 01:27:05,705
But it will cause inconvenience
to your family.

1372
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:06,637
So what, sir?

1373
01:27:07,482 --> 01:27:09,074
Both my sons will sleep in the balcony.

1374
01:27:09,450 --> 01:27:10,644
We'll sleep in the drawing room.

1375
01:27:11,286 --> 01:27:12,116
The bedroom is yours.

1376
01:27:14,055 --> 01:27:15,089
It'll just be a couple of days.

1377
01:27:15,089 --> 01:27:16,522
We're filing a case tomorrow.

1378
01:27:18,593 --> 01:27:19,928
If you want to file a case...

1379
01:27:19,928 --> 01:27:21,486
my elder son abhishek
will come tomorrow morning.

1380
01:27:22,230 --> 01:27:23,561
He practices at the district court itself.

1381
01:27:23,998 --> 01:27:24,623
Yes... that...

1382
01:27:26,467 --> 01:27:28,332
that would be a great help.
Thank you.

1383
01:27:31,706 --> 01:27:33,071
This is a new case.

1384
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:36,442
What's the urgency?

1385
01:27:36,945 --> 01:27:38,276
Sir, dr. Prabhakar anand's house has been...

1386
01:27:38,413 --> 01:27:40,347
your honour, it's about my house.

1387
01:27:40,748 --> 01:27:43,581
The defendants have occupied our house,
unauthorized and we're out on the streets.

1388
01:27:44,352 --> 01:27:45,216
I...

1389
01:27:45,253 --> 01:27:46,387
i'm an old man, your honour.

1390
01:27:46,387 --> 01:27:47,755
We need our house desperately.

1391
01:27:47,755 --> 01:27:50,121
Hence, eviction is very essential,
your honour.

1392
01:27:50,391 --> 01:27:52,450
Your honour, we would
like to be a party in this case.

1393
01:27:56,764 --> 01:27:57,287
You are?

1394
01:27:57,665 --> 01:27:59,534
I represent the bank.

1395
01:27:59,534 --> 01:28:02,628
The defendants are debtors of the bank
and that place is their business premise.

1396
01:28:03,037 --> 01:28:05,306
If they are removed from there,
their business will shut down...

1397
01:28:05,306 --> 01:28:07,342
and the bank won't be
able to recover its loan.

1398
01:28:07,342 --> 01:28:08,707
Sir, had you signed this?

1399
01:28:08,977 --> 01:28:09,306
Yes.

1400
01:28:09,444 --> 01:28:10,138
But...

1401
01:28:10,979 --> 01:28:11,980
i am a guarantor for their loan.

1402
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:13,414
Doesn't concern the house.

1403
01:28:13,414 --> 01:28:14,176
It does now, dad.

1404
01:28:14,515 --> 01:28:16,983
They've linked your guarantee
to this case.

1405
01:28:17,619 --> 01:28:18,643
Why did you sign that?

1406
01:28:21,756 --> 01:28:22,347
Your honour...

1407
01:28:23,424 --> 01:28:25,415
i need some time to study this.

1408
01:28:25,793 --> 01:28:27,488
Please grant us a short date.

1409
01:28:31,766 --> 01:28:32,664
Fourth of may.

1410
01:28:33,101 --> 01:28:34,090
Thank you, your honour.

1411
01:28:41,876 --> 01:28:43,138
Excuse me, excuse me, sir...

1412
01:28:43,444 --> 01:28:44,433
how can you do this?

1413
01:28:44,946 --> 01:28:45,469
That house is ours.

1414
01:28:45,513 --> 01:28:47,215
How can the bank stop us
from living there?

1415
01:28:47,215 --> 01:28:50,585
Sir, based on your guarantee
we gave them a loan to start their business.

1416
01:28:50,585 --> 01:28:52,416
And now you yourself
want to stop their business?

1417
01:28:52,453 --> 01:28:53,454
You are too much!

1418
01:28:53,454 --> 01:28:55,547
I gave a guarantee.
I didn't mortgage my house!

1419
01:28:55,957 --> 01:28:57,515
Do you know what a guarantee means?

1420
01:28:58,026 --> 01:29:00,528
If they can't repay the loan,
you will have to pay it back.

1421
01:29:00,528 --> 01:29:03,865
And if you can't, the bank
will sell your house to recover the money.

1422
01:29:03,865 --> 01:29:07,164
But, that was for a computer centre,
not for coaching classes.

1423
01:29:07,402 --> 01:29:08,494
Don't ask me about all that... please!

1424
01:29:08,603 --> 01:29:10,805
Who else are we to ask?

1425
01:29:10,805 --> 01:29:12,473
You're in-charge of the bank, aren't you?

1426
01:29:12,473 --> 01:29:14,941
I was. Now it's him.

1427
01:29:15,943 --> 01:29:17,410
May your reservation policy flourish!

1428
01:29:18,212 --> 01:29:20,915
My junior by four years
having got a job via reservation...

1429
01:29:20,915 --> 01:29:24,043
mr. Indradev ram has been
promoted as my senior.

1430
01:29:24,419 --> 01:29:25,147
Now, please go to him for your answers.

1431
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:27,949
Thank you, sir.
And, goodbye!

1432
01:29:45,606 --> 01:29:46,630
What happened?

1433
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:50,372
Poorbi?

1434
01:29:52,847 --> 01:29:53,836
Poorbi dear...

1435
01:30:00,121 --> 01:30:01,383
what is the matter?

1436
01:30:02,457 --> 01:30:04,584
Dad has given away our house in charity.

1437
01:30:04,926 --> 01:30:05,620
What?!

1438
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:08,626
By standing guarantee
for kamta uncle's sons' loan.

1439
01:30:10,331 --> 01:30:11,593
What are you saying?

1440
01:30:12,367 --> 01:30:14,961
Just that we no longer
have a house to live in.

1441
01:30:15,002 --> 01:30:16,871
Who says that you don't have a house?

1442
01:30:16,871 --> 01:30:18,862
Our lawyers will fight and get it back.

1443
01:30:19,207 --> 01:30:21,869
But, for now, move from here
and stay in my house.

1444
01:30:22,543 --> 01:30:25,012
Prabhakar, you too are unbelievable.

1445
01:30:25,012 --> 01:30:27,448
While i'm around,
how can you stay in a hotel!

1446
01:30:27,448 --> 01:30:29,643
Bhabhiji, my guest house is vacant.

1447
01:30:30,051 --> 01:30:32,320
You can live there
for as long as you want.

1448
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,618
I am truly... grateful, aniruddha.

1449
01:30:35,456 --> 01:30:37,253
I don't want to be a burden. We are...

1450
01:30:38,059 --> 01:30:38,582
we're fine.

1451
01:30:38,659 --> 01:30:40,094
There you go
with your stubbornness again!

1452
01:30:40,094 --> 01:30:42,196
Poorbi, get your stuff.

1453
01:30:42,196 --> 01:30:43,094
Bhabhi...

1454
01:30:44,699 --> 01:30:46,132
prabhakar, you are simply too much.

1455
01:30:46,567 --> 01:30:50,003
It's precisely this stubbornness
that's made the whole world your enemy.

1456
01:30:50,471 --> 01:30:53,541
If only you had listened to me
and not made that mistake...

1457
01:30:53,541 --> 01:30:55,065
you wouldn't be facing this situation today.

1458
01:30:55,543 --> 01:30:56,373
It's still not too late.

1459
01:30:56,411 --> 01:30:58,242
Which mistake are you
referring to, aniruddha?

1460
01:30:59,614 --> 01:31:01,445
Prabhakar, what aniruddha means...
just a second...

1461
01:31:04,352 --> 01:31:05,614
which mistake are you referring to?

1462
01:31:07,054 --> 01:31:09,284
That mistake which i committed...

1463
01:31:09,590 --> 01:31:12,320
by helping kamta's sons to
give him some relief?

1464
01:31:13,461 --> 01:31:15,292
Or that mistake...

1465
01:31:15,329 --> 01:31:19,467
which i committed by supporting
the supreme court's verdict on reservation?

1466
01:31:19,467 --> 01:31:21,702
Prabhakar, for god's sake.
Now at least be...

1467
01:31:21,702 --> 01:31:24,432
practical?
That's what you want to say, right?

1468
01:31:25,406 --> 01:31:29,342
No, aniruddha. For me,
these are not mistakes.

1469
01:31:29,644 --> 01:31:31,134
These are my principles.

1470
01:31:31,612 --> 01:31:33,011
And i believe in them.

1471
01:31:33,581 --> 01:31:35,572
So, know this, once and for all...

1472
01:31:36,717 --> 01:31:38,207
this is how i am.

1473
01:31:38,319 --> 01:31:41,652
I don't have any
intention of changing myself.

1474
01:31:42,023 --> 01:31:43,183
And, my family knows this.

1475
01:31:45,726 --> 01:31:46,249
Thank you.

1476
01:31:58,105 --> 01:31:59,402
What's happened to you, dad?

1477
01:32:00,508 --> 01:32:03,238
How can you insult aniruddha uncle
like this and drive him out?

1478
01:32:04,378 --> 01:32:05,504
You heard what he said?

1479
01:32:05,847 --> 01:32:06,973
So, what was wrong with that?

1480
01:32:08,216 --> 01:32:09,581
He didn't say anything wrong!

1481
01:32:10,551 --> 01:32:12,917
For you, your principles are everything.
That's it.

1482
01:32:14,155 --> 01:32:16,589
Do you ever think about
how your family lives?

1483
01:32:17,425 --> 01:32:19,994
That your daughter has to
endure taunts everyday in college...

1484
01:32:19,994 --> 01:32:21,962
because of your
headline-grabbing statements?

1485
01:32:23,030 --> 01:32:24,497
Does all this make any difference to you?

1486
01:32:25,333 --> 01:32:28,461
What is this you're saying, poorbi?
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

1487
01:32:28,603 --> 01:32:30,093
Nothing has happened suddenly, mom.

1488
01:32:31,272 --> 01:32:35,003
We've always done
what dad wanted - without question.

1489
01:32:36,143 --> 01:32:37,804
It didn't take me a second
to break off with deepak...

1490
01:32:37,879 --> 01:32:40,404
because he had hurt dad.

1491
01:32:41,549 --> 01:32:44,347
I lost sushant... i lost all my friends.

1492
01:32:45,152 --> 01:32:48,280
But, ask him if he ever bothered
to find out what i want?

1493
01:32:49,557 --> 01:32:53,254
I couldn't get into medicine because
dad wouldn't allow me one grace mark.

1494
01:32:53,427 --> 01:32:55,129
One grace mark!!

1495
01:32:55,129 --> 01:32:56,130
Why?

1496
01:32:56,130 --> 01:32:58,598
Because i'm the great
prabhakar anand's daughter.

1497
01:32:58,966 --> 01:33:01,833
So, i will have to reap the fruits
of his principles.

1498
01:33:02,036 --> 01:33:04,937
You will not speak to your father like this.
Never!

1499
01:33:05,139 --> 01:33:06,834
You're also suffering, mom.

1500
01:33:07,141 --> 01:33:09,143
Otherwise you wouldn't be
in this hotel room...

1501
01:33:09,143 --> 01:33:13,273
while someone else is having fun in your house
because your husband donated it to him.

1502
01:33:13,347 --> 01:33:14,041
Enough!

1503
01:33:15,182 --> 01:33:16,046
Just shut up.

1504
01:33:17,118 --> 01:33:18,619
You've said enough.

1505
01:33:18,619 --> 01:33:19,847
Now, not another word from you!

1506
01:33:20,121 --> 01:33:23,113
I don't know of any person
who is better than your father.

1507
01:33:23,324 --> 01:33:26,191
In a world filled with cowards,
he's a real hero.

1508
01:33:27,628 --> 01:33:29,163
No matter what he says or does...

1509
01:33:29,163 --> 01:33:30,391
i will always stand by him!

1510
01:33:31,499 --> 01:33:33,067
Without any question.

1511
01:33:33,067 --> 01:33:35,627
And, as long as you live with us,
you too will have to do the same.

1512
01:33:36,871 --> 01:33:37,895
Without any question.

1513
01:33:37,939 --> 01:33:39,964
Get it?

1514
01:33:43,044 --> 01:33:44,238
I hate my life!

1515
01:33:54,121 --> 01:33:56,214
I've gone over your... proposal, deepak.

1516
01:33:57,658 --> 01:33:58,522
Interesting.

1517
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:01,291
I'm lucky to have you as a guide, sir.

1518
01:34:02,229 --> 01:34:05,562
Dr. Prabhakar anand says,
you are the best in applied mathematics.

1519
01:34:05,666 --> 01:34:08,066
He's a fine man.
A great scholar.

1520
01:34:08,402 --> 01:34:10,165
I think, i'll email him right away.

1521
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:14,229
What's this?

1522
01:34:17,078 --> 01:34:18,375
Do you know anything about this?

1523
01:35:05,359 --> 01:35:05,688
Hello...

1524
01:35:06,127 --> 01:35:06,889
hello?

1525
01:35:07,662 --> 01:35:08,651
Hello poorbi?

1526
01:35:09,630 --> 01:35:10,562
It's me, deepak.

1527
01:35:12,033 --> 01:35:14,194
Hello? Can you hear me?

1528
01:35:15,636 --> 01:35:18,036
Poorbi, it's me... deepak.

1529
01:35:19,206 --> 01:35:20,366
Yes, how are you?

1530
01:35:20,541 --> 01:35:22,634
How are you people? How is sir?

1531
01:35:23,511 --> 01:35:24,409
I read on the net that...

1532
01:35:25,146 --> 01:35:26,443
yes, everything is fine here.

1533
01:35:27,014 --> 01:35:28,242
Dad has taken voluntary retirement.

1534
01:35:29,016 --> 01:35:30,005
Retirement?

1535
01:35:30,584 --> 01:35:33,382
Poorbi, is everything okay?
Tell me the truth, please...

1536
01:35:34,221 --> 01:35:36,246
yes, everything is fine. And you?

1537
01:35:37,258 --> 01:35:38,282
I'm not okay at all.

1538
01:35:38,325 --> 01:35:43,092
Poorbi, since i left home,
i've been cursing myself.

1539
01:35:43,497 --> 01:35:47,934
I just failed to understand him.
I behaved so badly with him.

1540
01:35:49,103 --> 01:35:51,094
How much i hurt him!

1541
01:35:51,505 --> 01:35:53,097
I wasn't in my senses, poorbi.

1542
01:35:54,108 --> 01:35:55,370
I feel so guilty.

1543
01:35:57,344 --> 01:35:58,936
Poorbi, i want to apologise to him.

1544
01:36:01,048 --> 01:36:03,676
Poorbi, please.
I want to talk to him.

1545
01:36:04,385 --> 01:36:05,511
He's fine.

1546
01:36:06,387 --> 01:36:08,252
Deepak, i'll speak with you later, ok?

1547
01:36:08,723 --> 01:36:10,156
Poorbi, please!

1548
01:36:43,624 --> 01:36:45,993
Here, hand me the plate.

1549
01:36:45,993 --> 01:36:46,721
And that too.

1550
01:36:56,237 --> 01:36:57,261
You're back, my dear?

1551
01:36:57,471 --> 01:36:57,732
Come.

1552
01:36:59,507 --> 01:37:02,442
See, i called for your favourite food.

1553
01:37:02,777 --> 01:37:07,009
Curry tempered with cumin seeds
and missi roti.

1554
01:37:07,715 --> 01:37:09,342
This is potato...

1555
01:37:16,090 --> 01:37:17,387
i'm sorry, dad.

1556
01:37:18,025 --> 01:37:19,492
I'm really sorry.

1557
01:37:21,428 --> 01:37:23,453
I hurt you so much.

1558
01:37:27,401 --> 01:37:28,425
I was scared.

1559
01:37:30,304 --> 01:37:31,498
Very scared.

1560
01:37:51,859 --> 01:37:52,553
Dad?

1561
01:37:53,494 --> 01:37:54,483
Yes, my dear?

1562
01:37:55,863 --> 01:37:57,330
I'm starving.

1563
01:38:20,053 --> 01:38:23,113
It's very important.
I need to see the honourable secretary.

1564
01:38:23,256 --> 01:38:25,349
He isn't here right now.
What is it?

1565
01:38:25,659 --> 01:38:28,695
The intimation for my scholarship
hasn't reached padmavati institute yet.

1566
01:38:28,695 --> 01:38:30,330
And, the deadline for admissions is 4 p.m.

1567
01:38:30,330 --> 01:38:31,627
What is your name?

1568
01:38:31,665 --> 01:38:33,599
Pandit dinanath upadhyay.

1569
01:38:34,601 --> 01:38:36,193
But, your name isn't in this list.

1570
01:38:36,503 --> 01:38:37,333
Sorry?

1571
01:38:38,538 --> 01:38:40,740
That's impossible!

1572
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:43,072
My name was there... at the top.

1573
01:38:43,643 --> 01:38:45,679
Prabhakar sir had personally
recommended my name. Please check...

1574
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:46,737
which prabhakar sir?

1575
01:38:47,347 --> 01:38:49,082
The ex-principal of s.t. M?

1576
01:38:49,082 --> 01:38:49,741
Yes, yes...

1577
01:38:50,884 --> 01:38:52,215
go tell him...

1578
01:38:52,852 --> 01:38:55,150
to get you admitted
through some reserved quota.

1579
01:38:55,488 --> 01:38:58,514
We don't waste our scholarships on
the recommendations of people like him.

1580
01:39:05,565 --> 01:39:06,623
Please do forgive me.

1581
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:09,465
I wasn't acquainted with
your current circumstances.

1582
01:39:10,704 --> 01:39:16,336
Else, i would never have come
in your presence with my difficulty.

1583
01:39:22,649 --> 01:39:23,274
Wait, pandit.

1584
01:39:25,852 --> 01:39:26,580
You did the right thing.

1585
01:39:27,887 --> 01:39:28,512
You...

1586
01:39:29,723 --> 01:39:30,747
you... just wait.

1587
01:39:38,832 --> 01:39:42,859
An entire year of this child
will be wasted.

1588
01:39:44,504 --> 01:39:48,201
And, more than that,
he'll completely break.

1589
01:39:50,577 --> 01:39:54,343
It's because of me that
those people cancelled his scholarship.

1590
01:40:17,337 --> 01:40:18,861
Hurry up, prabhakar.

1591
01:40:19,973 --> 01:40:23,966
If he doesn't reach on time,
his admission will lapse.

1592
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:42,490
You... i...

1593
01:40:43,496 --> 01:40:45,191
please don't...

1594
01:40:45,532 --> 01:40:48,729
young man, do not delay even a bit.

1595
01:40:49,202 --> 01:40:53,468
Go directly there, and conclude
the admission process.

1596
01:40:53,673 --> 01:40:54,935
Yes, sir.

1597
01:41:03,016 --> 01:41:04,506
All my wishes have come true, it seems.

1598
01:41:04,651 --> 01:41:06,744
Without a moment's hesitation,
he handed me the cheque.

1599
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:10,717
With just a balance of three minutes,
i made it to the admission-window.

1600
01:41:11,324 --> 01:41:12,791
Never will i be able to repay his debt.

1601
01:41:14,327 --> 01:41:14,986
Please take one...

1602
01:41:17,831 --> 01:41:18,422
congratulations.

1603
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:21,028
All my best... er...

1604
01:41:21,434 --> 01:41:21,991
auspicious wishes?

1605
01:41:22,368 --> 01:41:24,700
Yeah... auspicious wishes.

1606
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:41,316
Please sit.

1607
01:41:42,956 --> 01:41:43,752
Bring two coffees, please.

1608
01:41:45,792 --> 01:41:46,724
Poorbi...

1609
01:41:47,660 --> 01:41:49,321
i cannot tell you how sorry i am.

1610
01:41:50,630 --> 01:41:52,359
I failed to understand sir.

1611
01:42:11,718 --> 01:42:12,480
Have you spoken with deepak?

1612
01:42:16,422 --> 01:42:17,787
I didn't tell him anything.

1613
01:42:19,926 --> 01:42:20,950
Didn't want him to worry.

1614
01:42:24,764 --> 01:42:28,894
I want to meet sir.
I would really like to help.

1615
01:42:31,537 --> 01:42:35,735
Thanks. But right now,
he doesn't want to meet anyone.

1616
01:43:20,086 --> 01:43:23,522
There was no need to leave
your college in america and come back for this!

1617
01:43:23,556 --> 01:43:25,258
You could've just called me.

1618
01:43:25,258 --> 01:43:29,490
How dare mithilesh singh do this to prabhakar,
the messiah of the poor!

1619
01:43:30,330 --> 01:43:32,594
Hey luttan!
Call up the college.

1620
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,365
Don't you worry.

1621
01:43:36,002 --> 01:43:38,197
The backward caste
holds him in very high regard.

1622
01:43:38,438 --> 01:43:41,100
If need be, we'll all
land up there in a demonstration.

1623
01:43:41,374 --> 01:43:42,033
Hello...

1624
01:43:43,376 --> 01:43:45,503
it's the principal on line, big brother.

1625
01:43:46,245 --> 01:43:46,574
Hello?

1626
01:43:46,913 --> 01:43:48,073
Greetings, mr. Leader.

1627
01:43:48,114 --> 01:43:50,048
I'm going to greet you alright.

1628
01:43:50,083 --> 01:43:52,210
When did you leave
teaching and begin bullying?

1629
01:43:53,019 --> 01:43:54,253
I'm sorry... i don't understand.

1630
01:43:54,253 --> 01:43:55,550
I can come there and explain!

1631
01:43:56,155 --> 01:43:59,283
Look here, if prabhakar sir's house
isn't vacated in 24 hours...

1632
01:43:59,659 --> 01:44:02,595
i will hang your photograph on
the wall with a garland around it.

1633
01:44:02,595 --> 01:44:04,030
Why don't you hear me out once...

1634
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:06,362
there's nothing to be heard!

1635
01:44:06,499 --> 01:44:09,434
Sure, but why don't
you at least come here...

1636
01:44:12,939 --> 01:44:14,099
take it as vacated!

1637
01:44:21,247 --> 01:44:24,011
Please do come, mr. Bishambhar das.
You are welcome.

1638
01:44:24,050 --> 01:44:26,644
You can drop the welcomes,
mithilesh singh.

1639
01:44:26,686 --> 01:44:29,489
And drop your bullying,
and get out of our man's house.

1640
01:44:29,489 --> 01:44:31,657
You're absolutely right,
bishambhar das.

1641
01:44:31,657 --> 01:44:34,627
Now, he has become 'your' man...
dr. Prabhakar anand.

1642
01:44:34,627 --> 01:44:36,424
Oh... baburamji, you?

1643
01:44:36,763 --> 01:44:38,025
Lovely!

1644
01:44:38,531 --> 01:44:42,023
You get his cottage vacated,
he'll get your elected seat vacated!

1645
01:44:42,402 --> 01:44:44,131
Seat?! What are you saying?

1646
01:44:44,303 --> 01:44:45,292
What else?

1647
01:44:45,538 --> 01:44:50,305
You plough the land of backward caste politics,
he will harvest the gains!

1648
01:44:51,744 --> 01:44:55,305
You turned out to be even
more foolish than i realized.

1649
01:44:56,682 --> 01:44:58,513
Can't see through his game, can you?

1650
01:45:00,553 --> 01:45:03,556
By making just one statement
in support of reservation...

1651
01:45:03,556 --> 01:45:05,490
he has sidelined all of you.

1652
01:45:08,361 --> 01:45:11,125
Now watch how he becomes
the leader of the backward castes.

1653
01:45:11,464 --> 01:45:13,728
Leader? How will be become
the leader of the backward castes?

1654
01:45:14,233 --> 01:45:16,793
With the help of your retarded brain.

1655
01:45:18,671 --> 01:45:21,307
Go on, support him... do it.

1656
01:45:21,307 --> 01:45:21,739
Support?

1657
01:45:23,342 --> 01:45:24,673
Why should i support him?

1658
01:45:26,279 --> 01:45:29,715
You won't understand.
He's not a good man.

1659
01:45:32,018 --> 01:45:33,383
Thank you.

1660
01:45:35,555 --> 01:45:36,385
I get it.

1661
01:45:48,701 --> 01:45:49,497
Stop!

1662
01:46:01,547 --> 01:46:02,241
What is it?

1663
01:46:02,482 --> 01:46:03,710
I want you out of here!

1664
01:46:04,584 --> 01:46:06,176
Vacate the house? Now!

1665
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:08,387
Vacate this house?

1666
01:46:08,387 --> 01:46:09,513
Are you the collector or what?

1667
01:46:14,794 --> 01:46:16,523
Security! Security!!

1668
01:46:16,729 --> 01:46:19,596
Security! Security!

1669
01:46:26,672 --> 01:46:30,438
You'd have been on the streets,
if prabhakar sir hadn't given you shelter.

1670
01:46:30,476 --> 01:46:34,147
What did you think?
That he'll quietly keep running to the court...

1671
01:46:34,147 --> 01:46:35,546
while you continue to harass him?

1672
01:46:35,882 --> 01:46:37,543
Get out of this place right now!

1673
01:46:37,583 --> 01:46:40,143
Sir, i've called the police.

1674
01:46:40,620 --> 01:46:42,144
Mr. Deepak is on a rampage here.

1675
01:46:42,622 --> 01:46:45,420
Let him do exactly what he wants to.

1676
01:46:45,558 --> 01:46:47,753
Just don't let him leave. Understood?

1677
01:46:53,232 --> 01:46:54,756
Mr. Digambar...

1678
01:46:56,202 --> 01:46:59,763
have you stopped doing
live coverage these days or what?

1679
01:47:16,422 --> 01:47:17,184
You!

1680
01:47:17,657 --> 01:47:18,419
Mithilesh singh.

1681
01:47:19,725 --> 01:47:22,295
You are responsible for this situation.

1682
01:47:22,295 --> 01:47:23,227
I will not spare you!

1683
01:47:23,396 --> 01:47:24,697
You don't scare me.

1684
01:47:24,697 --> 01:47:26,562
Go tell this to dr. Prabhakar anand...

1685
01:47:26,599 --> 01:47:27,395
who sent you here.

1686
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:28,935
You rascal!

1687
01:47:28,935 --> 01:47:30,493
You think he is weak, huh?

1688
01:47:31,604 --> 01:47:33,333
This is my last warning.

1689
01:47:33,372 --> 01:47:35,533
Close your shop and get out of this place!

1690
01:47:35,608 --> 01:47:37,269
Otherwise, i'll throw you out myself!

1691
01:47:37,510 --> 01:47:37,839
Get out!

1692
01:47:40,580 --> 01:47:43,606
Did you see this?
Is this the way to behave?

1693
01:47:44,684 --> 01:47:47,585
We're running this coaching centre
in a legal and peaceful manner.

1694
01:47:47,887 --> 01:47:49,616
And prabhakar anand
sends his his thugs here.

1695
01:47:50,156 --> 01:47:51,623
Who're you calling a thug?

1696
01:47:51,824 --> 01:47:53,155
See, see...

1697
01:47:53,593 --> 01:47:54,389
- you thug!

1698
01:47:54,594 --> 01:47:55,583
- See for yourself.

1699
01:47:55,928 --> 01:47:58,590
- See for yourself.

1700
01:47:59,232 --> 01:48:01,367
See the level to which they have stooped.

1701
01:48:01,367 --> 01:48:03,460
Sir, what action will you take against this?

1702
01:48:04,503 --> 01:48:06,494
I'm... i'm totally shocked.

1703
01:48:07,607 --> 01:48:11,244
According to me,
there's only one place for such people.

1704
01:48:11,244 --> 01:48:11,642
Jail!

1705
01:48:12,511 --> 01:48:15,181
The owner of k.k. Coaching centre
alleges that...

1706
01:48:15,181 --> 01:48:19,352
it is on prabhakar anand's orders
that deepak kumar attacked them.

1707
01:48:19,352 --> 01:48:21,454
The police have arrested deepak kumar.

1708
01:48:21,454 --> 01:48:23,623
- He got into a fight with mithilesh singh.

1709
01:48:23,623 --> 01:48:26,421
- Mithilesh singh is in a shock
since the incident.

1710
01:48:28,261 --> 01:48:29,319
Are you dr. Prabhakar anand?

1711
01:48:29,929 --> 01:48:31,264
Yes, that's me.

1712
01:48:31,264 --> 01:48:32,822
You've been summoned
to the police station.

1713
01:48:32,999 --> 01:48:34,557
He was right here!
What has he?

1714
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:35,862
Kavita, please.

1715
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:37,532
Let's go.

1716
01:48:37,570 --> 01:48:38,332
I'm coming with you!

1717
01:48:38,371 --> 01:48:38,632
No, both of you stay here.

1718
01:48:45,778 --> 01:48:47,336
Dr. Anand what are you charged with?

1719
01:48:47,380 --> 01:48:48,847
Did you send hooligans there?

1720
01:48:49,282 --> 01:48:50,683
What is your relationship
with deepak kumar?

1721
01:48:50,683 --> 01:48:52,674
Are you taking revenge on mithilesh kumar?

1722
01:48:52,918 --> 01:48:56,410
Dr. Anand, first a principal,
then a convict - how do you feel?

1723
01:49:05,498 --> 01:49:07,125
- Sign your 'horoscope'!

1724
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:10,162
- Attack k.k. Coaching, will you?
Sign this!

1725
01:49:11,037 --> 01:49:12,436
Take him inside!

1726
01:49:17,610 --> 01:49:18,474
I am sorry, sir.

1727
01:49:20,212 --> 01:49:21,839
Welcome principal sir.

1728
01:49:23,416 --> 01:49:25,213
You seem like a reasonable gentleman.

1729
01:49:25,685 --> 01:49:28,449
That is why i had
explained to you with such respect.

1730
01:49:29,221 --> 01:49:30,813
Even hired a lawyer for you.

1731
01:49:31,123 --> 01:49:34,684
But you? You resorted
to using a cheap thug!

1732
01:49:35,428 --> 01:49:36,156
Sheesh!

1733
01:49:37,163 --> 01:49:38,425
I didn't expect this from you.

1734
01:49:38,497 --> 01:49:41,500
Inspector, please!
Sir didn't know anything about this.

1735
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:44,833
Hey, if you act smart,
i'll shove this all the way in!

1736
01:49:48,074 --> 01:49:51,669
You think the law is blindfolded, do you?

1737
01:49:52,278 --> 01:49:55,381
This guy will be locked
up under sections 326 and 452.

1738
01:49:55,381 --> 01:49:58,818
Under criminal conspiracy section 120-b,
should i haul you in too?

1739
01:49:58,818 --> 01:50:03,221
Lt'll make no difference to him,
inspector thakur. No difference at all!

1740
01:50:05,091 --> 01:50:06,854
He's sold his self-respect.

1741
01:50:07,526 --> 01:50:10,689
Otherwise, he wouldn't have been
kicked out of s.t.m. In this way.

1742
01:50:12,465 --> 01:50:15,298
He's done a doctorate in hypocrisy!

1743
01:50:16,102 --> 01:50:18,332
He has been unmasked.

1744
01:50:19,105 --> 01:50:21,173
Total fake teacher!

1745
01:50:21,173 --> 01:50:24,310
Hey mithilesh singh!
One more word about sir and...

1746
01:50:24,310 --> 01:50:27,677
see that?
See the students that he's trained?

1747
01:50:28,681 --> 01:50:31,707
For 35 years, he weaved a
web of deceit with mathematics.

1748
01:50:32,385 --> 01:50:33,784
Now, the result is out!

1749
01:50:34,820 --> 01:50:38,483
Sir, you were a zero,
you are a zero...

1750
01:50:38,624 --> 01:50:41,889
and you'll always remain a...

1751
01:50:42,695 --> 01:50:43,593
zero.

1752
01:50:43,896 --> 01:50:46,232
Mithilesh sir, what should we do with him?

1753
01:50:46,232 --> 01:50:48,257
There's no need to do anything.

1754
01:50:52,405 --> 01:50:56,273
You set out to serve a
'show cause' notice to k.k. Coaching?

1755
01:50:56,809 --> 01:50:59,903
It is the future of india's education.

1756
01:51:00,613 --> 01:51:03,275
There's no room for teachers like you!

1757
01:51:04,350 --> 01:51:06,716
Dr. Prabhakar anand, you are...

1758
01:51:08,621 --> 01:51:09,679
dismissed!

1759
01:51:54,733 --> 01:51:56,462
Sir...

1760
01:52:06,445 --> 01:52:08,777
but, i'm enquiring
about dr. Prabhakar anand.

1761
01:52:09,348 --> 01:52:10,212
What happened?

1762
01:52:10,850 --> 01:52:11,544
What happened, poorbi?

1763
01:52:11,584 --> 01:52:12,551
They hung up!

1764
01:52:12,551 --> 01:52:14,053
What did they say?
Where is he?

1765
01:52:14,053 --> 01:52:14,781
They said nothing, mom.

1766
01:52:17,690 --> 01:52:19,282
Ok, i will come tomorrow morning.

1767
01:52:22,294 --> 01:52:23,625
What did they do with dad?

1768
01:52:23,762 --> 01:52:25,598
They haven't charged him with anything.

1769
01:52:25,598 --> 01:52:27,065
- So, then?
- Then, where is he?

1770
01:52:27,533 --> 01:52:28,734
He left before i got here.

1771
01:52:28,734 --> 01:52:29,860
And deepak?

1772
01:52:30,703 --> 01:52:31,727
Where could he have gone?

1773
01:52:38,777 --> 01:52:41,075
What have i done!

1774
01:52:42,348 --> 01:52:44,077
I can never forgive myself.

1775
01:53:05,838 --> 01:53:10,175
- Shambhu, there's someone at the gate.

1776
01:53:10,175 --> 01:53:11,472
- Then, open it!

1777
01:53:20,786 --> 01:53:22,515
Guruji? You... here?

1778
01:53:23,622 --> 01:53:25,681
Shambhu, i need your help.

1779
01:53:29,528 --> 01:53:30,586
Please come.

1780
01:53:32,598 --> 01:53:34,733
Yes, this is hotel surendra vilas.

1781
01:53:34,733 --> 01:53:36,502
Please can i speak with poorbi.

1782
01:53:36,502 --> 01:53:37,196
Yes...

1783
01:53:37,469 --> 01:53:38,868
they just walked in.

1784
01:53:38,904 --> 01:53:41,668
Excuse me, ma'am...
some shambhu yadav on the line for you.

1785
01:53:42,408 --> 01:53:43,272
Shambhu?

1786
01:53:43,909 --> 01:53:44,398
Hello?

1787
01:53:44,543 --> 01:53:46,946
- Shambhu speaking... the stable owner.

1788
01:53:46,946 --> 01:53:48,470
- Guruji is here at my place.

1789
01:53:49,214 --> 01:53:52,479
- And he has asked you to come here.
Please come here.

1790
01:53:53,652 --> 01:53:55,142
Poorbi... what?

1791
01:53:57,256 --> 01:53:58,280
What happened?

1792
01:53:58,824 --> 01:54:00,155
Dad has called us.

1793
01:54:09,602 --> 01:54:10,261
Greetings.

1794
01:54:10,569 --> 01:54:11,870
Hey you!
Take the luggage - quick.

1795
01:54:11,870 --> 01:54:13,172
Where is he?

1796
01:54:13,172 --> 01:54:14,332
There...

1797
01:54:15,908 --> 01:54:19,435
he's at it.
Guruji... you know...

1798
01:54:19,745 --> 01:54:25,274
x is equal to y to the power a,
is equal to z to the power b to the power a...

1799
01:54:25,317 --> 01:54:28,354
is equal to z to the power ab,

1800
01:54:28,354 --> 01:54:32,757
is equal to x to the power c to the power ab,

1801
01:54:32,791 --> 01:54:35,294
is equal to x to the power abc...

1802
01:54:35,294 --> 01:54:38,998
therefore, abc = 1.

1803
01:54:38,998 --> 01:54:40,795
Q.e.d.

1804
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:43,630
That was quite easily done!

1805
01:54:46,438 --> 01:54:48,633
Okay, go now.
Get ready for school.

1806
01:54:48,741 --> 01:54:50,436
Next class this evening.

1807
01:54:50,476 --> 01:54:50,908
Go now.

1808
01:55:11,530 --> 01:55:13,088
Guruji, your tea.

1809
01:55:16,168 --> 01:55:17,692
Shall i say something, guruji?

1810
01:55:19,071 --> 01:55:24,566
I've never seen my muniya
actually laugh while studying.

1811
01:55:30,315 --> 01:55:34,453
Shambhu, there must be
other children around here...

1812
01:55:34,453 --> 01:55:36,944
in 10th and 12th grades?

1813
01:55:38,090 --> 01:55:40,684
Of course!
There are a lot, guruji.

1814
01:55:40,726 --> 01:55:42,591
There's a settlement over here.

1815
01:55:45,731 --> 01:55:46,959
Gather them.

1816
01:55:48,567 --> 01:55:50,159
No matter which society they come from.

1817
01:55:51,603 --> 01:55:52,968
I'll will teach them.

1818
01:55:55,307 --> 01:55:56,239
Free of cost.

1819
01:56:10,689 --> 01:56:13,351
Prabhakar, i want my house back.

1820
01:56:14,326 --> 01:56:19,161
Where have you brought us?
And what is this you've started?

1821
01:56:21,767 --> 01:56:23,792
We will reclaim our house.

1822
01:56:25,003 --> 01:56:26,231
And everything else...

1823
01:56:28,006 --> 01:56:31,442
self-respect, reputation
and all those values that...

1824
01:56:31,477 --> 01:56:37,143
i lived by, as a teacher.
All of it!

1825
01:56:37,816 --> 01:56:43,015
These petty traders of
education cannot terrorise us!

1826
01:56:45,257 --> 01:56:47,350
I will wipe them out!

1827
01:56:47,986 --> 01:56:48,918
Excellent!

1828
01:56:50,055 --> 01:56:51,784
The collections are good this time.

1829
01:56:51,823 --> 01:56:54,189
But, henceforth collect
the entire fees in advance.

1830
01:56:54,693 --> 01:56:59,858
If you continue to run this centre like this,
i'll extend your contract to five years.

1831
01:57:00,232 --> 01:57:01,028
But, sir...

1832
01:57:01,199 --> 01:57:02,768
prabhakar uncle had said two years...

1833
01:57:02,768 --> 01:57:04,668
it's a civil case!

1834
01:57:04,903 --> 01:57:07,167
He'll be running to
the court for 20-25 years.

1835
01:57:07,639 --> 01:57:10,938
I hear he lives in the stable now
with his family.

1836
01:57:11,710 --> 01:57:14,110
Does he want
reservation for buffaloes now?

1837
01:57:14,646 --> 01:57:16,910
No, sir. A few students from
the neighbourhood slum go to him.

1838
01:57:17,149 --> 01:57:19,049
What else can he do?

1839
01:57:19,084 --> 01:57:21,211
After all, he has to
pay rent to shambhu!

1840
01:57:26,858 --> 01:57:29,019
Yes, what is it?

1841
01:57:29,795 --> 01:57:31,695
I have deepak kumar's bail papers.

1842
01:57:32,631 --> 01:57:33,928
His bail has been granted.

1843
01:57:36,134 --> 01:57:36,998
Hey...

1844
01:57:38,370 --> 01:57:40,065
let that 'hero' go.

1845
01:57:43,775 --> 01:57:45,675
Come with me, mr. Advocate.

1846
01:57:51,349 --> 01:57:52,976
Get a grip, fellow.

1847
01:57:53,585 --> 01:57:55,746
This hooliganism won't be
tolerated here.

1848
01:57:59,224 --> 01:58:01,692
Here, please sign this.

1849
01:58:06,198 --> 01:58:09,031
Thanks, mr. Advocate.
But, who got the bail done?

1850
01:58:59,551 --> 01:59:02,884
For a maximum product of q into q minus q...

1851
01:59:03,421 --> 01:59:06,288
both parts must be the same. Therefore...

1852
01:59:09,361 --> 01:59:13,297
q divided by q is equal to 2.

1853
01:59:17,435 --> 01:59:18,834
What is it, muniya?

1854
01:59:21,406 --> 01:59:23,340
Sir... i won't study.

1855
01:59:24,943 --> 01:59:25,932
Why not?

1856
01:59:29,181 --> 01:59:32,150
Sir, the principal has issued a warning...

1857
01:59:32,150 --> 01:59:34,419
that no one who scores
below 65% in the preliminaries...

1858
01:59:34,419 --> 01:59:36,751
will be allowed to take the final exams.

1859
01:59:36,888 --> 01:59:39,857
And sir, i've never scored above 57%.

1860
01:59:40,959 --> 01:59:41,983
When is your pre-board?

1861
01:59:42,194 --> 01:59:42,455
Sorry?

1862
01:59:42,894 --> 01:59:43,792
From the 23rd, sir.

1863
01:59:44,029 --> 01:59:46,998
23rd. We have two weeks!

1864
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:51,363
Why won't you score 65%, then?
We'll make it happen!

1865
01:59:54,206 --> 01:59:55,833
You will work hard, won't you?

1866
01:59:57,309 --> 01:59:58,105
- Will you?
- Yes.

1867
01:59:58,143 --> 01:59:59,667
Then you will get a 65%!

1868
02:00:05,016 --> 02:00:06,418
So, as i was saying...

1869
02:00:06,418 --> 02:00:10,252
a charge q is divided
into two parts of q and q minus q.

1870
02:00:11,022 --> 02:00:12,390
If the coulomb...

1871
02:00:12,390 --> 02:00:14,449
- sushant and deepak want to meet you.

1872
02:00:14,759 --> 02:00:17,057
Repulsion between them
when they are separated...

1873
02:00:17,429 --> 02:00:18,293
dad, please!

1874
02:00:19,764 --> 02:00:20,788
Even they want to help.

1875
02:00:24,970 --> 02:00:27,165
I don't need anybody's help.
Thank you.

1876
02:00:30,375 --> 02:00:32,866
Then the ratio of q/q should be...

1877
02:00:32,911 --> 02:00:36,438
(a) 2, (b) 1/2

1878
02:00:36,481 --> 02:00:40,941
(c) 4 or (d) 1/4

1879
02:00:41,019 --> 02:00:45,479
as i was saying,
a charged q is divided into two parts...

1880
02:01:07,512 --> 02:01:11,209
it's 3 a.m.
Where are you going at this hour?

1881
02:01:11,950 --> 02:01:13,417
I have to help them revise.

1882
02:01:14,519 --> 02:01:16,885
They have a math exam today.

1883
02:01:40,111 --> 02:01:40,941
Guruji...

1884
02:01:41,413 --> 02:01:42,505
so, the revision is going on...

1885
02:01:43,214 --> 02:01:43,908
yes, sir.

1886
02:01:44,983 --> 02:01:46,883
So, where have we got stuck?

1887
02:01:48,119 --> 02:01:49,279
See...

1888
02:01:49,888 --> 02:01:53,558
minus 2k squared
cancels out plus 2k squared.

1889
02:01:53,558 --> 02:01:54,889
Yes, of course!

1890
02:02:02,267 --> 02:02:02,961
Greetings madam.

1891
02:02:03,001 --> 02:02:03,558
Greetings.

1892
02:02:04,469 --> 02:02:05,868
Is... everything okay?

1893
02:02:05,904 --> 02:02:07,337
Yes, yes. Everything's fine.

1894
02:02:13,178 --> 02:02:15,043
This is dr. Prabhakar anand!

1895
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:17,605
Yes, it is he who teaches
all the students here.

1896
02:02:18,283 --> 02:02:20,615
Our principal has come to meet you.

1897
02:02:23,221 --> 02:02:24,051
Greetings, sir.

1898
02:02:24,356 --> 02:02:26,620
Greetings. What brings you here?

1899
02:02:27,325 --> 02:02:30,954
Your student, muniya,
has done what we haven't ever seen earlier.

1900
02:02:31,496 --> 02:02:35,330
The student who would score 50-57%
earlier has scored a 76% in the preliminary exam!

1901
02:02:36,001 --> 02:02:37,093
What?!! Really?

1902
02:02:37,268 --> 02:02:38,292
Only you could have done this, sir!

1903
02:02:38,536 --> 02:02:41,973
She will do even better in
the board exams. Right, muniya?

1904
02:02:41,973 --> 02:02:43,008
I'll score more than 80%!

1905
02:02:43,008 --> 02:02:44,635
More than 80...

1906
02:02:45,543 --> 02:02:46,845
my muniya!!

1907
02:02:46,845 --> 02:02:48,146
Please serve tea!

1908
02:02:48,146 --> 02:02:50,273
I'll... i'll get some sweets.

1909
02:02:51,082 --> 02:02:53,107
- What's the matter?

1910
02:02:53,251 --> 02:02:55,446
I've stood first in my class!

1911
02:02:57,088 --> 02:03:00,080
Many of our students
take private tuitions and coaching.

1912
02:03:00,525 --> 02:03:01,082
At k.k. Too.

1913
02:03:02,193 --> 02:03:04,184
But, this time,
muniya has beaten everyone.

1914
02:03:04,429 --> 02:03:07,592
Now all the parents are
inquiring about muniya's coaching school.

1915
02:03:07,999 --> 02:03:11,230
Stable school!
Anyone who wishes to study can join.

1916
02:03:12,470 --> 02:03:13,872
Refund our fees.

1917
02:03:13,872 --> 02:03:14,600
We don't want our children to study here.

1918
02:03:14,639 --> 02:03:17,199
Sir, please...
tej, just attend to them.

1919
02:03:19,077 --> 02:03:19,441
Hello sir?

1920
02:03:19,944 --> 02:03:21,138
What is going on here, sunny?

1921
02:03:21,613 --> 02:03:23,248
The number of students
has reduced to half this month!

1922
02:03:23,248 --> 02:03:24,549
Admissions are still going on.

1923
02:03:24,549 --> 02:03:28,319
A group of 20 is coming to join today.
Perhaps a little publicity...

1924
02:03:28,319 --> 02:03:29,081
- publicity?!

1925
02:03:30,188 --> 02:03:32,486
Since when did k.k. Coaching
begin needing publicity?

1926
02:03:44,335 --> 02:03:45,700
What is this, tej prasad?

1927
02:03:45,904 --> 02:03:49,533
Sir, i've already spoken with them about it.
In a few days some more students...

1928
02:03:51,709 --> 02:03:53,370
sir, in a day or two...

1929
02:03:55,914 --> 02:03:56,903
what's this?

1930
02:04:07,325 --> 02:04:08,087
Where are these people going?

1931
02:04:08,326 --> 02:04:12,023
Sir, uh... in the stable opposite...
coaching classes are being held.

1932
02:04:12,130 --> 02:04:13,427
These are kids from gandhi nagar, sir.

1933
02:04:13,932 --> 02:04:15,695
Sushant seth has
arranged a bus service for them.

1934
02:04:21,573 --> 02:04:22,437
Really?!

1935
02:04:24,209 --> 02:04:26,040
Looks like his farce has begun to work.

1936
02:04:48,733 --> 02:04:51,224
If your notes are ready,
please give them to me.

1937
02:04:51,269 --> 02:04:52,759
I'll get photocopies made.

1938
02:04:53,171 --> 02:04:54,900
Now, there are more
than 70 students in the stable now.

1939
02:04:58,476 --> 02:04:59,465
Mrs. Dey?

1940
02:05:00,411 --> 02:05:02,046
Forgive me, dinkarji.

1941
02:05:02,046 --> 02:05:03,035
I won't be able to come any longer.

1942
02:05:04,015 --> 02:05:06,347
Sir, the principal has summoned you.

1943
02:05:09,954 --> 02:05:11,319
Come... have a seat.

1944
02:05:13,324 --> 02:05:15,417
You seem to be putting in
a lot of extra hours at the stable.

1945
02:05:16,294 --> 02:05:18,091
You guys are minting good money, eh?

1946
02:05:19,998 --> 02:05:21,397
I offer my services there for free.

1947
02:05:21,799 --> 02:05:22,800
But why?!

1948
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:27,362
Mr. Dinkar, why are you throwing away
your hard-earned knowledge into a dustbin?

1949
02:05:27,705 --> 02:05:30,469
Join our k.k. Coaching.
Your talent will be rewarded there.

1950
02:05:31,342 --> 02:05:33,003
100,000 rupees a month!

1951
02:05:35,246 --> 02:05:38,272
Mr. Mithilesh, i am devoted
to the principles of prabhakarji.

1952
02:05:40,385 --> 02:05:41,784
You can't buy me.

1953
02:05:42,887 --> 02:05:46,015
Fine, fine... please sit.
What's the hurry?

1954
02:05:46,257 --> 02:05:48,960
You've rejected my offer.
No problem.

1955
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:50,359
Please take this new time-table with you.

1956
02:05:50,862 --> 02:05:52,727
You are in big demand
among the students.

1957
02:05:53,164 --> 02:05:55,400
So, two classes in the morning...
two in the evening.

1958
02:05:55,400 --> 02:05:57,027
Four extra classes everyday.

1959
02:05:58,403 --> 02:05:59,870
But, this is blatantly unjust!

1960
02:06:00,538 --> 02:06:02,972
I... i... i won't be able to do this.

1961
02:06:03,975 --> 02:06:08,746
Dinkarji, if you don't follow
these instructions...

1962
02:06:08,746 --> 02:06:11,977
i'll be forced to
take disciplinary action.

1963
02:06:13,351 --> 02:06:16,154
The bank guarantee that
s.t.m. Has taken for your house mortgage...

1964
02:06:16,154 --> 02:06:17,314
will have to be withdrawn.

1965
02:06:18,823 --> 02:06:20,347
As for yourjob, well...

1966
02:06:21,459 --> 02:06:24,758
mr. Ex-vice principal...

1967
02:06:26,898 --> 02:06:28,490
you have no other option.

1968
02:06:29,767 --> 02:06:31,359
Your house could get auctioned.

1969
02:06:32,337 --> 02:06:34,931
Then, perhaps you too will
have to seek shelter in that stable.

1970
02:06:41,779 --> 02:06:43,337
See you in the class.

1971
02:06:49,387 --> 02:06:51,514
Namaste, dinkar, you're early today.

1972
02:06:56,027 --> 02:06:56,857
What's wrong?

1973
02:06:59,998 --> 02:07:02,432
Sir, i'm resigning from s.t.m.

1974
02:07:03,434 --> 02:07:08,804
Sir, mithilesh singh has lured
the other teachers away with money.

1975
02:07:09,374 --> 02:07:10,807
He tried the same with me too.

1976
02:07:11,876 --> 02:07:13,070
Sir, i can't take it anymore.

1977
02:07:13,111 --> 02:07:14,100
Sir, i'm leaving this job.

1978
02:07:14,479 --> 02:07:16,276
No, dinkar.
You will do nothing of the sort.

1979
02:07:16,814 --> 02:07:18,577
I know you have
your responsibilities.

1980
02:07:18,616 --> 02:07:21,085
But, you're alone, sir!
Sir, this job isn't...

1981
02:07:21,085 --> 02:07:24,384
don't worry about me.
I will manage. Ok?

1982
02:07:33,631 --> 02:07:37,192
Come, come on, here all of you.

1983
02:07:39,971 --> 02:07:42,307
Come... come with me...

1984
02:07:42,307 --> 02:07:44,342
it's like this.

1985
02:07:44,342 --> 02:07:48,836
The other teachers
won't be able to come now.

1986
02:07:49,547 --> 02:07:54,118
So, those of you who can come
in the afternoon, be here at 3 p.m.

1987
02:07:54,118 --> 02:07:57,849
And those who can make it
in the evening, come at 7 p.m.

1988
02:07:58,222 --> 02:08:00,213
I will take three sessions. Daily.

1989
02:08:00,358 --> 02:08:01,188
Pseudopodia.

1990
02:08:01,859 --> 02:08:04,987
The parental body itself
functions as the reproductive unit.

1991
02:08:05,029 --> 02:08:07,965
The unicellular parent organism
divides itself into two parts.

1992
02:08:07,965 --> 02:08:12,595
...1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1 within brackets.

1993
02:08:13,471 --> 02:08:14,165
Now...

1994
02:08:15,173 --> 02:08:17,869
obtain the universe of the following matrix...

1995
02:08:18,242 --> 02:08:20,608
using... elementary proportions.

1996
02:08:21,112 --> 02:08:21,942
And...

1997
02:08:27,585 --> 02:08:30,315
i'll be back in a minute.
Finish the diagrams.

1998
02:08:47,004 --> 02:08:50,440
Dad, please rest for a while.

1999
02:08:50,575 --> 02:08:51,940
No, i'm okay, my dear.

2000
02:08:52,510 --> 02:08:54,171
I have to complete their lesson today.

2001
02:08:54,345 --> 02:08:56,006
Please, dad... just for a little while.

2002
02:08:56,681 --> 02:08:58,615
You worry a lot about me.

2003
02:08:59,484 --> 02:09:01,645
Okay then,
please get me a cup of tea.

2004
02:09:03,955 --> 02:09:04,444
Okay.

2005
02:09:04,956 --> 02:09:05,752
Thank you.

2006
02:09:16,134 --> 02:09:18,227
Okay, settle down,
settle down... alright?

2007
02:09:19,170 --> 02:09:19,727
Let's start.

2008
02:09:28,379 --> 02:09:30,643
Dad, sit still for a minute at least!

2009
02:09:31,516 --> 02:09:36,421
I gave them a test.
I have to check the answers.

2010
02:09:36,421 --> 02:09:38,514
Just what are you
trying to do, prabhakar?

2011
02:09:38,689 --> 02:09:41,590
How long are you
going to do all this alone?

2012
02:09:42,260 --> 02:09:43,522
What if something happens to you?

2013
02:09:48,733 --> 02:09:51,327
Well, anything can happen
at anytime, kavita.

2014
02:09:52,737 --> 02:09:55,205
But, the path that
i have chosen to walk on...

2015
02:09:56,541 --> 02:09:58,372
i am not going to stop.

2016
02:09:59,610 --> 02:10:02,374
Even if i have to
walk alone all the way.

2017
02:10:10,154 --> 02:10:13,646
Hariya, come...
have some sweets. Good!

2018
02:10:14,358 --> 02:10:17,020
Deepak, here have some sweets.

2019
02:10:18,029 --> 02:10:20,156
I had organised a prayer
for lord satyanarayan.

2020
02:10:20,665 --> 02:10:23,793
There are only 30 days to go
for muniya's board exams.

2021
02:10:24,135 --> 02:10:25,837
Suraj, please distribute these sweets.

2022
02:10:25,837 --> 02:10:26,769
To everyone!

2023
02:10:28,706 --> 02:10:29,331
So...

2024
02:10:30,141 --> 02:10:31,039
how is sir?

2025
02:10:32,410 --> 02:10:34,846
Obsessed by the same desire.

2026
02:10:34,846 --> 02:10:37,610
From 5 a.m. Until late at night...

2027
02:10:37,648 --> 02:10:38,816
he's at it for the kids.

2028
02:10:38,816 --> 02:10:43,150
There's poorbi and kavita who help.

2029
02:10:44,188 --> 02:10:46,190
But he really has no
breathing space at all.

2030
02:10:46,190 --> 02:10:47,425
We get double benefits.

2031
02:10:47,425 --> 02:10:50,553
Guruji teaches us in day
and here deepak guides us at night.

2032
02:10:52,063 --> 02:10:54,156
If only you were with him...

2033
02:10:54,565 --> 02:10:56,396
he would've had some support.

2034
02:10:57,768 --> 02:11:00,638
27 students from our neighbourhood
attend sir's morning class.

2035
02:11:00,638 --> 02:11:02,503
That's all very well, deepak.

2036
02:11:02,540 --> 02:11:04,375
But with more students coming in...

2037
02:11:04,375 --> 02:11:05,433
and guruji being alone...

2038
02:11:14,113 --> 02:11:18,709
a upon x+4 plus b upon x+7

2039
02:11:18,751 --> 02:11:22,454
and to find the value of the
constants a and b, we will assume...

2040
02:11:22,454 --> 02:11:25,355
x + 4 is equal 0

2041
02:11:25,391 --> 02:11:29,418
which means that x is equal to - 4

2042
02:11:34,433 --> 02:11:35,764
- namaskar.
- Namaste.

2043
02:11:36,702 --> 02:11:39,170
Sir, our kids want to join your class.

2044
02:11:40,105 --> 02:11:43,233
Both of these go to k.k. Coaching but
now want to come to your class.

2045
02:11:44,109 --> 02:11:47,340
My sons, shiv and om are already with you.

2046
02:11:47,513 --> 02:11:49,674
Seeing their improvement,
these people have also come.

2047
02:11:52,051 --> 02:11:54,053
Any student who wishes
to study is welcome here.

2048
02:11:54,053 --> 02:11:55,421
You can definitely send them.

2049
02:11:55,421 --> 02:11:57,355
But, sir, we had one request.

2050
02:11:57,389 --> 02:11:59,584
Please teach our kids separately.

2051
02:12:00,292 --> 02:12:02,726
Many people want
to send their kids to you.

2052
02:12:02,795 --> 02:12:05,831
If you wish, we can even give
you a separate place.

2053
02:12:05,831 --> 02:12:09,062
We are willing to
pay any fee that you ask.

2054
02:12:09,368 --> 02:12:13,405
The only thing is...
sitting near them is a problem.

2055
02:12:13,405 --> 02:12:15,202
These kids are...

2056
02:12:15,574 --> 02:12:16,700
you understand, don't you?

2057
02:12:17,076 --> 02:12:19,244
I mean... they don't even bathe.

2058
02:12:19,244 --> 02:12:21,405
Being with them will
ruin our children's culture.

2059
02:12:22,748 --> 02:12:25,808
There's a stench that comes
from your thoughts, in fact.

2060
02:12:26,819 --> 02:12:28,878
Your views are disgusting.

2061
02:12:30,222 --> 02:12:31,712
For me, all children are equal.

2062
02:12:33,225 --> 02:12:36,562
I will teach them together,
in one class.

2063
02:12:36,562 --> 02:12:37,654
If anyone wants to leave, he can.

2064
02:12:39,098 --> 02:12:41,467
And now, if you'll excuse me,
may i get back to my class?

2065
02:12:41,467 --> 02:12:43,560
We were talking about your benefit.

2066
02:12:43,702 --> 02:12:46,638
There, at k.k. Coaching,
mithileshji has brought in 10 teachers...

2067
02:12:46,638 --> 02:12:48,469
from delhi who're paid
200,000 a month.

2068
02:12:48,540 --> 02:12:50,175
He has also reduced the fees.

2069
02:12:50,175 --> 02:12:51,767
Who wants to send their kids to you?

2070
02:12:52,511 --> 02:12:52,875
Let's go!

2071
02:12:53,645 --> 02:12:55,237
Shiv! Om! Come on home.

2072
02:12:55,614 --> 02:12:57,479
From tomorrow, you'll study at k.k.

2073
02:12:57,516 --> 02:12:58,448
C'mon... c'mon!

2074
02:13:00,319 --> 02:13:00,876
Come on.

2075
02:13:03,789 --> 02:13:04,881
Right now.

2076
02:13:07,192 --> 02:13:10,320
So, if we have to find the value.

2077
02:13:10,529 --> 02:13:12,793
Of a and b, let us assume...

2078
02:13:13,799 --> 02:13:15,630
let us assume that...

2079
02:13:16,635 --> 02:13:19,661
x+4 is equal to 0

2080
02:13:20,139 --> 02:13:20,833
therefore...

2081
02:13:21,340 --> 02:13:23,501
x is equal to - 4

2082
02:13:23,776 --> 02:13:24,470
now...

2083
02:13:25,544 --> 02:13:26,945
how do we factor this?

2084
02:13:26,945 --> 02:13:30,244
Sir, x+7 is equal to 0 i.e. X is equal to - 7

2085
02:13:30,682 --> 02:13:32,445
now put this value in f of x

2086
02:13:32,718 --> 02:13:35,881
sir, except at x + 7 i.e. In the denominator

2087
02:13:36,722 --> 02:13:37,689
correct!

2088
02:13:38,924 --> 02:13:39,822
Sir, 2 by 3.

2089
02:13:43,562 --> 02:13:44,654
Now...

2090
02:13:45,864 --> 02:13:48,731
if z is a complex number then...

2091
02:13:50,502 --> 02:13:55,641
what does mod z = 1,
represent geometrically?

2092
02:13:55,641 --> 02:13:57,309
Sir, it represents a circle.

2093
02:13:57,309 --> 02:13:59,743
It's origin will be at the centre
and radius will be one.

2094
02:14:08,854 --> 02:14:11,345
Mass of hardness of a substance...

2095
02:14:11,390 --> 02:14:14,827
multiplied by multiplication factor,
how much is it friends?

2096
02:14:14,827 --> 02:14:15,828
Eighty one...

2097
02:14:15,828 --> 02:14:17,496
so today's question is to find...

2098
02:14:17,496 --> 02:14:21,300
the resistance of the circuit
va is equal to vb, vb is equal to vc...

2099
02:14:21,300 --> 02:14:22,631
always remember...

2100
02:14:22,668 --> 02:14:25,204
in the exam,
read the questions twice...

2101
02:14:25,204 --> 02:14:26,694
or even thrice, ok?

2102
02:14:27,539 --> 02:14:29,875
The answer always lies within the question.

2103
02:14:29,875 --> 02:14:33,402
We answered prabhakar sir's question
as soon as he wrote it on the board.

2104
02:14:33,679 --> 02:14:34,509
Really?

2105
02:14:35,447 --> 02:14:36,004
What did he say?

2106
02:14:36,582 --> 02:14:37,640
Nothing, he merely praised us.

2107
02:15:44,783 --> 02:15:50,380
I knew that no one else
could sabotage my class like this.

2108
02:15:50,856 --> 02:15:51,720
Sir...

2109
02:15:53,558 --> 02:15:55,549
sir, we never meant to.

2110
02:15:56,395 --> 02:15:57,384
We were just...

2111
02:15:58,263 --> 02:16:01,366
sir, whatever punishment
you want to give us...

2112
02:16:01,366 --> 02:16:02,731
we will happily accept it.

2113
02:16:04,403 --> 02:16:07,634
But, please forgive us, sir.

2114
02:16:08,774 --> 02:16:09,638
That will happen.

2115
02:16:11,610 --> 02:16:12,872
You will certainly be punished.

2116
02:16:16,982 --> 02:16:19,177
From tomorrow,
you will hold your classes...

2117
02:16:21,386 --> 02:16:22,614
together with mine.

2118
02:16:45,744 --> 02:16:47,974
Tearing walls down

2119
02:16:50,549 --> 02:16:52,710
breaking new ground

2120
02:16:54,953 --> 02:16:56,853
is this light

2121
02:16:59,524 --> 02:17:03,551
leaving behind shackles that held it tight

2122
02:17:04,529 --> 02:17:08,397
the darkness will surround you

2123
02:17:09,001 --> 02:17:11,731
make it your ink pot

2124
02:17:13,238 --> 02:17:16,230
and script a brand new day

2125
02:17:17,642 --> 02:17:21,578
smash the locks, let the sun shine

2126
02:17:22,447 --> 02:17:26,907
hold the light in your hands, make it thine

2127
02:17:27,352 --> 02:17:31,686
break the wells, the river will flow

2128
02:17:31,790 --> 02:17:35,783
inhale it, share it, let it glow

2129
02:17:36,361 --> 02:17:37,055
it's the light

2130
02:17:37,262 --> 02:17:37,785
it belongs to everyone

2131
02:17:39,364 --> 02:17:40,729
it's shining bright

2132
02:17:41,533 --> 02:17:43,262
it belongs to everyone

2133
02:17:44,002 --> 02:17:45,526
it's shining bright

2134
02:17:45,871 --> 02:17:48,431
it's shining bright all around

2135
02:17:57,816 --> 02:17:58,646
mr. Principal...

2136
02:17:59,084 --> 02:18:01,416
i am going to teach with prabhakarji.

2137
02:18:02,454 --> 02:18:04,752
Do what you can.

2138
02:18:18,603 --> 02:18:20,935
May there be paths for everyone

2139
02:18:20,972 --> 02:18:22,872
lined with hope on either side

2140
02:18:22,908 --> 02:18:27,368
and the light shines along through the ride

2141
02:18:27,446 --> 02:18:30,115
may there be paths for everyone

2142
02:18:30,115 --> 02:18:32,049
lined with hope on either side

2143
02:18:32,084 --> 02:18:36,421
and the light shines along through the ride

2144
02:18:36,421 --> 02:18:38,757
there was a void, but now it's filled

2145
02:18:38,757 --> 02:18:41,021
there was a barrier, but now it's gone

2146
02:18:41,059 --> 02:18:43,755
the sun and the sky

2147
02:18:45,030 --> 02:18:46,759
are right here

2148
02:18:50,502 --> 02:18:54,768
smash the locks, let the sun shine

2149
02:18:54,873 --> 02:18:59,478
hold the light in your hands, make it thine

2150
02:18:59,478 --> 02:19:03,676
break the wells, the river will flow

2151
02:19:04,349 --> 02:19:08,376
inhale it, share it, let it glow

2152
02:19:08,453 --> 02:19:09,147
it's the light

2153
02:19:09,354 --> 02:19:11,481
it belongs to everyone

2154
02:19:11,823 --> 02:19:13,825
it's shining bright

2155
02:19:13,825 --> 02:19:15,850
it belongs to everyone

2156
02:19:16,495 --> 02:19:18,029
it's shining bright

2157
02:19:18,029 --> 02:19:19,097
guruji!

2158
02:19:19,097 --> 02:19:21,600
These are people from century ply.

2159
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:23,635
They helped enormously in building this.

2160
02:19:23,635 --> 02:19:24,863
Thank you very much.

2161
02:19:25,103 --> 02:19:27,037
Your contribution was indeed very worthy.

2162
02:19:27,072 --> 02:19:29,131
No sir, we just did our duty.

2163
02:19:29,608 --> 02:19:31,643
You're slogging away in a stable...

2164
02:19:31,643 --> 02:19:33,008
with that worthless guy?!

2165
02:19:33,044 --> 02:19:34,773
You'll be thrown out of college.

2166
02:19:35,013 --> 02:19:36,139
You will fail!

2167
02:19:36,414 --> 02:19:37,711
Go ahead and throw me out.

2168
02:19:38,717 --> 02:19:40,412
But, no one can fail me now.

2169
02:19:41,553 --> 02:19:43,612
You see, i have the
best teacher in the world.

2170
02:19:44,089 --> 02:19:44,783
Prabhakar anand.

2171
02:19:46,391 --> 02:19:47,050
Best?!

2172
02:19:48,093 --> 02:19:52,998
We're offering you such brilliant,
expensive teachers, the best facilities...

2173
02:19:52,998 --> 02:19:56,034
and guaranteeing admission to our university.

2174
02:19:56,034 --> 02:19:59,137
And yet you are sending your kids to
that stable to reduce their future to bullshit?!

2175
02:19:59,137 --> 02:20:02,507
Here you teach just by
distributing notes and guess papers.

2176
02:20:02,507 --> 02:20:04,407
Our kids are sick of memorizing everything.

2177
02:20:04,442 --> 02:20:07,045
Whatever that may be.
But we fetch you results!

2178
02:20:07,045 --> 02:20:08,603
Finally, that's all that matters.

2179
02:20:08,947 --> 02:20:09,709
Result!

2180
02:20:10,081 --> 02:20:11,844
Let the exams get over, sir.

2181
02:20:11,883 --> 02:20:13,145
We'll see about the results too.

2182
02:20:13,585 --> 02:20:14,986
It cancels out 2xy, therefore...

2183
02:20:14,986 --> 02:20:18,523
2 into x square plus y square is equal to

2184
02:20:18,523 --> 02:20:21,515
2 into x square plus y square

2185
02:20:21,793 --> 02:20:24,159
q. E. D.

2186
02:20:24,462 --> 02:20:27,098
- That was quite easily done.

2187
02:20:27,098 --> 02:20:28,156
Very good!

2188
02:20:46,418 --> 02:20:52,390
- Eight months ago, dr. Prabhakar anand
began teaching some 5-6 kids here in this stable.

2189
02:20:52,390 --> 02:20:56,292
- Steadily five became 10,
10 to 20, 20 to 100.

2190
02:20:56,328 --> 02:21:00,031
- And today, there are a total
of 327 students of 12th standard!

2191
02:21:00,031 --> 02:21:05,560
- They took free coaching at this preparatory school
and their results are out today.

2192
02:21:05,604 --> 02:21:09,441
- 100% success!
And that too in the 1st division!

2193
02:21:09,441 --> 02:21:13,275
- From slum-dwellers to
those that arrive in luxury cars...

2194
02:21:13,311 --> 02:21:17,215
- all category of children study here.
There is no discrimination here.

2195
02:21:17,215 --> 02:21:21,709
Even those, like k.k. Coaching,
that charge hundreds of thousands of rupees...

2196
02:21:21,753 --> 02:21:25,689
have been beaten by this
free coaching centre that...

2197
02:21:25,724 --> 02:21:28,522
began in a stable
and is now being termed...

2198
02:21:28,560 --> 02:21:29,754
super stable!

2199
02:21:36,001 --> 02:21:38,765
This stable coaching centre
will have to be shut down!

2200
02:22:12,037 --> 02:22:16,371
Sister! Just see what
they've pasted on my gate.

2201
02:22:17,409 --> 02:22:18,034
Just see.

2202
02:22:20,578 --> 02:22:21,442
Oh god!

2203
02:22:22,647 --> 02:22:23,705
What does it say?

2204
02:22:24,249 --> 02:22:25,511
It's an official notice.

2205
02:22:26,051 --> 02:22:28,820
Shambhu uncle, did you take this land
on lease from the government?

2206
02:22:28,820 --> 02:22:31,584
Yes, the then collector,
ramesh chandra...

2207
02:22:31,623 --> 02:22:33,614
got it done 20 years ago.

2208
02:22:34,259 --> 02:22:36,386
The government wants it back now.

2209
02:22:38,063 --> 02:22:41,700
What! But i...
deposit the rent every month!

2210
02:22:41,700 --> 02:22:43,168
I have all the receipts.

2211
02:22:43,168 --> 02:22:43,600
Look.

2212
02:22:43,635 --> 02:22:44,397
What happened?

2213
02:22:46,504 --> 02:22:49,074
They've given us a notice of seven days
but have served it today...

2214
02:22:49,074 --> 02:22:50,598
which is the last day.

2215
02:22:50,642 --> 02:22:54,271
But how can anyone
just snatch my land from me?

2216
02:22:55,480 --> 02:22:59,075
The government wants to sell
this stable and build a warehouse here.

2217
02:23:02,287 --> 02:23:06,155
But we all know who is using this excuse...

2218
02:23:07,225 --> 02:23:09,327
to demolish our stable school...

2219
02:23:09,327 --> 02:23:10,589
and why.

2220
02:23:11,229 --> 02:23:13,094
But this time we won't let it happen!

2221
02:23:13,732 --> 02:23:15,529
We definitely won't, guruji.

2222
02:23:16,267 --> 02:23:17,564
Even if they shoot us!

2223
02:23:47,128 --> 02:23:48,026
Open the gate!

2224
02:23:48,363 --> 02:23:49,489
- You aren't allowed inside!

2225
02:23:56,404 --> 02:24:00,500
Do you people know
why i'm not allowed to go in?

2226
02:24:02,777 --> 02:24:04,768
Because i supported prabhakar sir.

2227
02:24:05,713 --> 02:24:10,946
First they pushed him out of here,
and now they're hell bent on destroying him.

2228
02:24:12,520 --> 02:24:14,010
This is the moment, friends.

2229
02:24:15,089 --> 02:24:18,650
Come with me,
and put an end to their dirty intentions.

2230
02:24:49,757 --> 02:24:51,019
Why should our children go there?

2231
02:24:51,059 --> 02:24:52,185
To get beaten and shot?

2232
02:24:52,727 --> 02:24:54,024
You are absolutely right.

2233
02:24:54,662 --> 02:24:55,822
Why should they go?

2234
02:24:56,231 --> 02:25:00,793
Why did prabhakar anand raise his voice for
the poor and the backward and ruined his life?

2235
02:25:01,135 --> 02:25:05,037
Why does he live in a stable and
work round the clock to teach these kids for free?

2236
02:25:05,139 --> 02:25:05,969
Why?

2237
02:25:07,175 --> 02:25:09,439
Because that isn't merely a stable.

2238
02:25:09,477 --> 02:25:10,569
It is a pathway.

2239
02:25:11,112 --> 02:25:13,637
A pathway for these
and other kids to move ahead.

2240
02:25:14,182 --> 02:25:16,013
To have a better life.

2241
02:25:16,584 --> 02:25:18,552
For them to be educated.

2242
02:25:18,653 --> 02:25:21,121
So that they can hold
their heads high in this society!

2243
02:25:21,155 --> 02:25:24,249
Friends, today that stable needs you.

2244
02:25:25,226 --> 02:25:27,626
Prabhakar sir needs you!

2245
02:25:28,496 --> 02:25:29,827
What is your decision?

2246
02:25:29,864 --> 02:25:31,229
The decision has
already been made, madam.

2247
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:33,462
No one will go from here.

2248
02:25:33,501 --> 02:25:34,991
Why not?
We'll certainly go!

2249
02:25:36,004 --> 02:25:37,562
Come on, let's go!

2250
02:25:40,975 --> 02:25:41,669
Get lost!

2251
02:25:42,176 --> 02:25:42,733
Hey!

2252
02:25:42,844 --> 02:25:43,708
Hey stop them!

2253
02:25:43,745 --> 02:25:45,144
Don't damage my car!

2254
02:26:39,334 --> 02:26:41,165
It is the government's order!

2255
02:26:42,036 --> 02:26:44,061
This land has to be vacated.

2256
02:26:44,305 --> 02:26:49,538
You people leave quietly
and let us finish our work.

2257
02:26:50,111 --> 02:26:51,669
Otherwise, in one minute...

2258
02:26:51,746 --> 02:26:53,976
there is no need
for any warning, inspector.

2259
02:26:55,016 --> 02:26:56,711
You do your work and we'll do ours.

2260
02:26:57,685 --> 02:26:59,050
Roll the bulldozer!

2261
02:27:00,321 --> 02:27:03,188
You have batons, guns,
a lot of power.

2262
02:27:03,925 --> 02:27:07,190
But, it's obvious that you
aren't aware of our strength.

2263
02:27:07,762 --> 02:27:09,286
We have determination!

2264
02:27:10,965 --> 02:27:12,227
And it's growing now.

2265
02:27:13,601 --> 02:27:15,660
No power can crush it.

2266
02:27:16,270 --> 02:27:18,761
All of you, look carefully
and understand one thing.

2267
02:27:19,273 --> 02:27:23,300
That these kids come
from families that are like yours.

2268
02:27:24,946 --> 02:27:28,211
The dream that they have of a future...

2269
02:27:29,817 --> 02:27:32,251
is the same that is
nurtured in your house too.

2270
02:27:32,620 --> 02:27:37,284
Those powerful contractors and ministers,
on whose orders you've come here...

2271
02:27:37,358 --> 02:27:39,792
they do not want that dream to be realised.

2272
02:27:40,628 --> 02:27:42,255
Now, the choice is yours.

2273
02:27:43,631 --> 02:27:47,032
Do you want to protect this dream...

2274
02:27:48,136 --> 02:27:50,161
or do you want to crush it?

2275
02:28:15,229 --> 02:28:16,423
Hey!
What's going on here?

2276
02:28:19,634 --> 02:28:20,760
Hey, what's happening?

2277
02:28:21,102 --> 02:28:22,797
You have orders to raze this stable.

2278
02:28:23,871 --> 02:28:24,667
Understood?

2279
02:28:26,374 --> 02:28:26,965
Thakur!

2280
02:28:28,209 --> 02:28:29,767
I'll get you stripped of your uniform.

2281
02:28:30,044 --> 02:28:30,908
Understood?

2282
02:28:31,446 --> 02:28:32,879
Do your duty!

2283
02:28:34,849 --> 02:28:36,077
Empty this stable!

2284
02:28:36,851 --> 02:28:38,216
Use your batons...

2285
02:28:38,686 --> 02:28:39,812
and drive everyone out of here!

2286
02:28:39,921 --> 02:28:40,853
Use your batons!

2287
02:28:40,955 --> 02:28:42,149
Demolish that!

2288
02:28:43,124 --> 02:28:44,284
You don't know me...

2289
02:28:46,194 --> 02:28:47,855
hey! Have you lost it or what?

2290
02:28:48,129 --> 02:28:50,324
We had, because we feared you.

2291
02:28:50,398 --> 02:28:51,922
But, now we have
recovered our senses.

2292
02:28:51,999 --> 02:28:53,023
Come on!

2293
02:28:53,134 --> 02:28:54,999
Batons are going to be
used on them now!

2294
02:28:57,872 --> 02:28:59,134
- Do you hear me?

2295
02:29:00,842 --> 02:29:04,710
- Mark my words!
You will be finished!

2296
02:29:06,247 --> 02:29:10,707
I've built a university for 12 billion.

2297
02:29:10,985 --> 02:29:12,282
I will buy everyone out!

2298
02:29:13,121 --> 02:29:14,748
I will buy off this land.

2299
02:29:14,822 --> 02:29:16,687
And... these cops.

2300
02:29:16,724 --> 02:29:17,281
And you too!

2301
02:29:17,358 --> 02:29:18,086
- Enough!

2302
02:29:19,360 --> 02:29:20,088
Enough!

2303
02:29:21,362 --> 02:29:22,954
You've said enough mithilesh singh.

2304
02:29:24,065 --> 02:29:26,226
What is your credibility actually?

2305
02:29:26,300 --> 02:29:28,291
You have pawned your soul itself!

2306
02:29:28,369 --> 02:29:31,031
Your desperation clearly reveals
your bankruptcy.

2307
02:29:31,072 --> 02:29:32,869
Bankruptcy?!

2308
02:29:33,374 --> 02:29:34,238
Bankruptcy?!

2309
02:29:34,275 --> 02:29:38,871
No matter how much poison
greedy frauds like you may unleash...

2310
02:29:38,946 --> 02:29:43,042
this country understands
the value of knowledge and education.

2311
02:29:43,184 --> 02:29:45,516
It knows how to respect its teachers.

2312
02:29:46,354 --> 02:29:48,049
Why 12 billion?

2313
02:29:48,089 --> 02:29:51,752
Even if you stake 12 trillion,
you will get nothing!

2314
02:29:52,360 --> 02:29:55,921
The future of india's education
isn't for sale!

2315
02:29:56,397 --> 02:29:58,763
You had called me a zero, hadn't you?

2316
02:29:59,400 --> 02:30:00,526
Thank you!

2317
02:30:01,235 --> 02:30:04,727
That zero was invented by a great indian.

2318
02:30:05,106 --> 02:30:07,438
Its power you have obviously
failed to comprehend.

2319
02:30:07,542 --> 02:30:11,239
Anyone who collides with a zero,
gets reduced to a zero himself.

2320
02:30:11,279 --> 02:30:12,473
Becomes nothing!

2321
02:30:13,181 --> 02:30:14,170
You...

2322
02:30:14,782 --> 02:30:19,412
and your low-down greedy bosses
have lost your game now.

2323
02:30:19,487 --> 02:30:20,784
You are finished.

2324
02:30:21,556 --> 02:30:22,113
Finished!

2325
02:30:22,223 --> 02:30:23,247
Finished?!

2326
02:30:24,091 --> 02:30:25,080
I?

2327
02:30:25,259 --> 02:30:26,419
Is that so?

2328
02:30:27,094 --> 02:30:28,891
You don't know who i am!

2329
02:30:29,797 --> 02:30:31,788
I will destroy this stable.

2330
02:30:32,466 --> 02:30:33,933
Watch me!

2331
02:30:34,368 --> 02:30:36,029
You'd set out to create a super stable, eh?

2332
02:30:37,038 --> 02:30:38,335
Nowjust wait.

2333
02:30:38,406 --> 02:30:40,806
And watch!
Baburamji...

2334
02:30:42,109 --> 02:30:42,905
- what!

2335
02:30:43,511 --> 02:30:44,500
- What do you mean,
you didn't know?

2336
02:30:45,246 --> 02:30:46,577
Is this why i got you promoted?

2337
02:30:47,215 --> 02:30:48,273
- For a day like this?

2338
02:30:48,382 --> 02:30:49,246
Sir, i'm almost there...

2339
02:30:49,317 --> 02:30:51,217
- just drive the bulldozers over it.

2340
02:30:51,552 --> 02:30:53,952
- And if batons don't work, use bullets.

2341
02:30:54,322 --> 02:30:56,882
- If that stable is not destroyed...

2342
02:30:56,958 --> 02:30:57,982
i'll destroy you!

2343
02:31:00,494 --> 02:31:01,119
D. G... d.g.p. Sir...

2344
02:31:02,797 --> 02:31:03,991
just look at this!

2345
02:31:05,833 --> 02:31:07,926
You have been served with a notice.

2346
02:31:08,336 --> 02:31:10,998
There is no need for a warning.

2347
02:31:11,138 --> 02:31:14,437
After 10 seconds,
there will be a baton-charge!

2348
02:31:14,942 --> 02:31:19,402
And, if we meet with
any resistance from you...

2349
02:31:19,947 --> 02:31:21,209
we will open fire!

2350
02:31:22,016 --> 02:31:23,608
Be ready for a baton-charge!

2351
02:31:29,457 --> 02:31:30,287
- Ten...

2352
02:31:31,259 --> 02:31:31,987
- nine...

2353
02:31:32,026 --> 02:31:33,288
- these people are not
going to obey!

2354
02:31:33,394 --> 02:31:33,985
- Eight...

2355
02:31:34,262 --> 02:31:35,490
- i'm telling you...
this countdown will do nothing!

2356
02:31:35,529 --> 02:31:36,359
- Seven...

2357
02:31:37,031 --> 02:31:38,259
- just roll the bulldozers!

2358
02:31:38,399 --> 02:31:39,195
- Six...

2359
02:31:40,134 --> 02:31:41,032
- five...

2360
02:31:42,003 --> 02:31:42,560
- four...

2361
02:31:42,603 --> 02:31:43,865
- it's no good.

- Where are you people looking?

2367
02:31:57,285 --> 02:31:58,343
- Roll the bulldozers!

2368
02:31:59,186 --> 02:32:00,915
All this is illegal!

2369
02:32:01,088 --> 02:32:03,454
- No one is ready to listen!

2370
02:32:03,491 --> 02:32:05,288
- Is there a law or not?

2371
02:32:06,827 --> 02:32:08,021
Shakuntala ma'am!

2372
02:32:08,062 --> 02:32:09,324

2373
02:32:09,864 --> 02:32:11,695

Ma'am...

2375
02:32:14,302 --> 02:32:16,429
you've become
the chief minister, prabhu dayal.

2376
02:32:16,704 --> 02:32:19,332
You can't even fill up
the potholes on the roads but...

2377
02:32:20,041 --> 02:32:21,338
you will drive bulldozers over children?

2378
02:32:21,475 --> 02:32:24,000
Please forgive me, ma'am.
I just got to know.

2379
02:32:24,078 --> 02:32:25,340
These people will move away

2380
02:32:25,513 --> 02:32:26,343
- Sorry, ma'am.

2381
02:32:26,380 --> 02:32:27,312

There... cover that.

Who is this man?

2385
02:32:33,988 --> 02:32:37,355
He's... uh... the principal of s.t.m.,
mithilesh singh.

2386
02:32:37,858 --> 02:32:40,019
He's lost his mental balance.

2387
02:32:40,294 --> 02:32:41,090
Sir!

2388
02:32:41,762 --> 02:32:42,751

Sir, i'll withdraw them immediately.

Guruji, the police is leaving.

2391
02:32:46,834 --> 02:32:49,029
Does this mean our stable
won't be demolished?

2392
02:32:49,403 --> 02:32:50,165
It won't be demolished, muniya.

2393

2402
02:33:06,020 --> 02:33:08,887
Now, i teach here.
With sir. In the stable class.

2403
02:33:10,758 --> 02:33:12,953
I have just one demand, ma'am.

2404
02:33:13,294 --> 02:33:14,761
From the s.t.m. Trust...

2405
02:33:15,663 --> 02:33:16,652
you should have my father... er...

2406
02:33:18,132 --> 02:33:18,757

Yes, discharged.

2408
02:33:20,668 --> 02:33:21,930
Please discharge him!

2409
02:33:24,038 --> 02:33:25,300
Do you remember...

2410
02:33:25,339 --> 02:33:28,206
when i quit
s.t.m.'s day-to-day affairs?

2411
02:33:28,676 --> 02:33:30,109
Yes, 32 years ago.

2412
02:33:30,644 --> 02:33:32,168
When you became the principal.

2413
02:33:33,014 --> 02:33:36,882
And, you just left,
without even telling me!

2414
02:33:37,651 --> 02:33:39,278
I apologise sincerely for that.

2415
02:33:40,688 --> 02:33:42,849
But, it was clear that
my time there was over.

2416
02:33:43,891 --> 02:33:47,691
And, if i say that
actually your time starts now?

2417
02:33:49,263 --> 02:33:53,131
Madam, i can't become
the principal of s.t.m. Again.

2418
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:54,189
I have a lot to do here.

2419
02:33:54,268 --> 02:33:56,202
Not s.t.m. But...

2420
02:33:56,404 --> 02:33:58,395
s.t. Remedial centre.

2421
02:33:59,073 --> 02:34:01,132
Aniruddha has told me everything.

2422
02:34:01,442 --> 02:34:05,845
In our own college campus,
we will open a remedial centre where...

2423
02:34:05,913 --> 02:34:10,907
needy and weak students
will receive free coaching.

2424
02:34:11,218 --> 02:34:16,383
And, you will be its principal
and chief trustee for life.

2425
02:35:09,643 --> 02:35:11,907
Q. E. D.

2426
02:35:12,046 --> 02:35:15,106
- That was quite easily done!

00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,280
Come every day and
get insulted in Prime time.

74
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,760
You..
- What do you have to say my friend?

75
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,760
You tell me.

76
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,160
Understand one thing that..

77
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,680
..even politicians have some dignity.
Understood.

78
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,720
Do answer me Mr. Vachani.

79
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,520
You cannot do that.

80
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,520
Mr. Vachani you have to answer.

81
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,520
Give the phone to Pankaj.

82
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,720
Pankaj, first of all cut the feed now.

83
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,320
And switch it to something else.

84
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,240
Anything.

85
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,480
And secondly remove Arnab
from prime time slot from Monday.

86
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,040
Listen, ask Neha to come to studio.

87
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,840
Everyone go out.
I want to talk to Arnab.

88
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,120
Hey, go out.

89
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,840
What?

90
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,080
Hey..

91
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,000
How did you get wet?

92
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,360
I threw water on myself.

93
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,480
I can give away my life.
- Yes of course.

94
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,400
Listen, Arnab from tomorrow
you will do the 7-8PM slot.

95
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,040
Now will I have to do 7-8 as well?

96
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,680
No, no you will have to do that only.

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,840
Only that.

98
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,560
What?
- Yes.

99
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,720
7-8 PM means.

100
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,240
Now will I tell people
how to cook food?

101
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,440
Yes. It is cookery slot so understand
what and how you will do it.

102
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,760
What the hell Roy?

103
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,880
What the hell? You tell me.

104
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,400
Really.

105
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,840
First you were saying that TRP is
not coming and losses are mounting up.

106
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,680
Now TRP is coming
and you have a problem.

107
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,840
Do you increase TRP like this?

108
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,720
Is this the way to increase TRP?

109
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,600
Okay.

110
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,320
Now you remember the
chapters of moral science.

111
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,600
Very nice.

112
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,840
What happened?

113
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,000
Burn it.
- Warning comes downstairs.

114
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,720
Look at Neha's shows, buddy.

115
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,320
Pure fashion reporting
delivered with a pinch of salt.

116
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,920
And ratings are good too.

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,040
Nobody is complaining.

118
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,680
Roy, to make shows
on lingerie and sex..

119
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,400
..and to openly challenge
politicians on a live show..

120
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,640
..is two different things.

121
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,880
Oh hello, mind your language.

122
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,400
It is not lingerie show but
India's best glamour update show.

123
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:01,840
Oh.

124
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,800
I am the best news
writer in the country.

125
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,560
I am doing this show on Roy's request.

126
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,680
Why are you involving
me into this debate?

127
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,800
Take your beauty parlor out.

128
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,560
There is no need to do this here.

129
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,560
I am here because Roy called me.

130
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,840
And I am getting the
prime time slot of your show.

131
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,760
Yeah..

132
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,840
What?

133
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,120
Yes..

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,240
Will Neha do prime
time slot on my place?

135
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,080
Have you literally taken
the show by its name? One on one.

136
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,040
If she does the show then
politicians will give fewer answers..

137
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,920
..and will give phone
numbers to her more.

138
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,240
I am leaving Roy.

139
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,040
Let me know when Mr.
Angry pans has cooled down.

140
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,040
I will come later.
- No, no Neha.

141
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,200
You are not going anywhere.
Wait, wait..

142
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,120
This man must know how important
it is to change with time.

143
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,640
Even you know that..

144
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,880
..Neha used to be the best
writer in the news business.

145
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,600
Okay.

146
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,920
She is doing this show
because the channel needs her.

147
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,320
You know flexibility.

148
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,280
Shut up.

149
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,400
Have cup and smell the coffee.

150
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,040
No one wants to see
your show nowadays.

151
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,520
It is okay that ratings
were fine today but at what cost.

152
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,800
Tomorrow RGV will come.

153
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,760
Again I will have to give answer about
6 cameras, 4 mikes and so many bones.

154
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,760
Do you know that?

155
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,240
It is not my fault that you
cannot handle political hooliganism.

156
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,120
My work was to handle heated
debates and that I was doing.

157
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,600
Until you..
Hello. What is it?

158
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,080
I said I will get the watermelon.
Watermelon, watermelon....

159
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,000
Yes baby..

160
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,160
Nothing, nothing..

161
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,160
I have chucked out an office boy
so he is getting angry and shouting.

162
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes.

163
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,400
I will get it.

164
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,840
Sure.

165
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,720
Bye sweetheart.

166
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,520
Sorry I did not see.

167
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,120
I was in heated debate so I got..

168
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,640
It was not a heated debate.

169
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,640
It was hardly a debate.

170
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,080
You had said at 10'0clock.

171
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,920
Why is so much shouting
happening outside?

172
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,320
Stop it.
- Stop it, Pankaj.

173
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,560
Don't laugh, Arnab.

174
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,440
A 70 year old man crying on
prime time.. it was not heated debate.

175
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,760
It seemed as if you have snatched
a lollipop from a 6 year old child.

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,480
Did you see the way he was crying?

177
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,160
But it was good one, yeah..

178
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
Arnab!

179
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,520
You were a good news anchor.
- Thanks.

180
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,920
But this drama cannot
continue every day, buddy.

181
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,040
Even you know it. It is not feasible.

182
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,360
People want to see some real stuff.

183
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,240
Remember those days when
people would leave their dinner..

184
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,640
..and sit in front of the TV.

185
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,360
Which topic would Arnab discuss on?
Who will be court martial?

186
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,400
It's gone buddy.

187
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,760
Look!

188
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,200
I can't sustain like this.

189
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,640
Even the order from top management has
come that we have got 2 months time.

190
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,360
We have to make profit by them.

191
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,120
Otherwise everything finished.

192
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,560
Channel is finished. You are finished.

193
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,360
You are under estimating me, Roy.

194
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,080
Do you remember..

195
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,120
..that I had brought the
channel to the top position?

196
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,080
It was me who had made
the channel the biggest brand.

197
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,280
When a person talks
about past again and again..

198
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,360
..then one should understand
that there is some problem.

199
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,560
And you very well know
it what the problem is.

200
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,040
Do something.

201
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,360
You can do it.
You have done it before as well.

202
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,040
Think huge.

203
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,920
Otherwise many people
are pushing me for 7-8 slot.

204
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So now Arnab Ghosh..

205
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,320
..will have to compete
with chef Kapoor for screen time.

206
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,920
What the hell?
- Neha, please.

207
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,600
Buddy, think of something.

208
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,280
Think of something quickly.

209
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,080
We just have two months time.
- Hey..

210
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,360
Pankaj, will this noise stop or not?

211
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,600
Sir I am vinod.

212
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,240
Vinod, is this a
studio or a fish market?

213
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,200
Come baby.

214
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,000
""Whosoever you bless Haji Ali...""

215
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,760
""He need not worry at all,
Haji Ali, Haji Ali..""

216
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,640
""Whosoever you bless Haji Ali..""

217
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,320
""He need not worry at all,
Haji Ali, Haji Ali..""

218
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,760
""Ali, Ali Haji Ali..""

219
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,160
""Ali, Ali Haji Ali..""

220
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,560
""Ali, Ali Haji Ali..""

221
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,440
""Ali, Ali Haji Ali..""

222
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,000
""Haji Ali..""

223
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,440
""My Haji Ali..""

224
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,560
""The day is not good
so help to let it pass soon.""

225
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,400
""Give my life a direction.""

226
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,200
""Change my bad luck into good luck.""

227
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,240
""Help me to come out of problems.""

228
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:11,440
""Bless me; help me to find my way.""

229
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,000
""Ali, Ali Haji Ali..""

230
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,320
""Ali, Ali Haji Ali..""

231
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,760
""Ali, Ali Haji Ali..""

232
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,160
""Ali, Ali Haji Ali..""

233
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,520
""Ali, Ali Haji Ali..""

234
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,000
""Ali, Ali Haji Ali..""

235
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,800
""Ali, Ali Haji Ali..""

236
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,680
What happened? Why have you
made face like a grilled chicken?

237
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,320
Many people make a mistake of removing
the chicken before it is grilled.

238
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Look at this.
It should be of this color.

239
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,640
Till that time let be on grill.

240
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,600
I am being thrashed in
the office and you are joking.

241
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,400
Are you just being
thrashed and not me?

242
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,800
That also from my own child.

243
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,680
It is 4th month. Do you remember?

244
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,080
Sorry.
- Sorry.

245
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,760
Then you must be enjoying?
- What?

246
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,680
I mean.. sorry baby.
After making chicken roast....

247
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,840
I mean..now is turn of spices.

248
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,040
..people are happy when the
child kicks for the first time.

249
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,480
Like that I said. Yes.

250
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,880
You know everything..

251
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,120
..then you do it.

252
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,000
I am sorry.

253
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,680
How are you feeling?

254
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,040
Does someone talk like
this with pregnant woman?

255
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,760
Of course I am feeling awful.

256
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,240
Leave it.

257
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,280
Okay.

258
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,880
Now tell me what has happened?

259
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,600
Or you want me to read your face.

260
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,120
Shall I say the truth?

261
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,240
No, tell me the story of Harry Potter.
Of course, tell me the truth.

262
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,480
I have been removed
from the prime time slot.

263
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,920
What?
- I will do the cookery show. 7-8 PM.

264
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,920
Like this.

265
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,200
Shit.

266
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,320
But what happened suddenly today.

267
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,920
Roy said it point blankly
that we have two months.

268
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,760
If the ratings don't
go up we are doomed.

269
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,800
Channel will shut down.

270
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,800
You will get another assignment. I
mean there is no other Arnab in India.

271
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,240
It is not that easy.

272
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,360
I will not get a second
chance failing at my level.

273
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,360
And even if I get I can't
expect to be paid like before.

274
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,800
It is too much.

275
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,720
I have booked so many
thing online for the baby.

276
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,480
Don't worry.
We will figure something out.

277
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,480
Life is already going on loan.

278
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,760
If we do not do something quickly..

279
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,000
..then we will have
to come from Toyota to Tata.

280
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,480
If you do not have budget for
cashew nuts then there is no problem.

281
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,400
We can use groundnuts
to make this dish cheaper.

282
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,560
There will be a slight
change in taste.

283
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,000
Tell me, what you did the whole day.

284
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,920
Browsing but did not buy anything.

285
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,720
What were you finding?

286
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,160
White Sari.

287
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,720
What?
- What?

288
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,080
Don't be so surprised Arnab.

289
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,080
I will have to buy because
of the way you insult..

290
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,040
..the politicians on live TV.

291
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,280
Sometimes I feel..

292
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,120
..I should have taken the
offer of News India two years back.

293
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,000
They are on top of the charts now.

294
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,520
Relax Arnab.

295
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,560
Whatever happens is for good.

296
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,880
The important thing is that
you cannot control everything.

297
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,240
So just let it be.

298
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,800
It is very easy to talk.

299
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,160
You feel regretted thinking
practically about it.

300
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,280
You know that time I got the offer.

301
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,560
May be.

302
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
Listen.

303
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,360
I have to tell you something.
- Tell me.

304
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,880
Tell me.

305
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,240
Do you remember the night I conceived?

306
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,880
You came late from studio that day.

307
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,400
Shekhar had come home before you came.

308
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,840
Shekhar, your ex boyfriend.

309
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,280
Okay.

310
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,320
We just got talking and had some wine.

311
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,640
One thing just led to another and..

312
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,080
I..

313
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,600
You know women get stupid
and emotional sometimes.

314
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,800
What are you going to say?

315
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,280
I..

316
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,440
Speak.

317
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,200
I am not too sure
but I am just confused.

318
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,720
Maybe this baby is yours or his..

319
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,600
I don't know.

320
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,040
Male snake attracts the
female snake with his smell.

321
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,720
After the female snake agrees
they both enjoy sex for many hours.

322
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,240
Are you enjoying?

323
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,800
What do you mean by saying that?

324
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,640
Don't worry. It is yours.

325
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,760
I just wanted to say
that things can go worst.

326
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,040
So you learn to respect
your achievements, husband.

327
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,200
Relax.

328
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,000
I am going to sleep, good night.

329
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,400
Good night.

330
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,080
Okay, okay how old is the story?

331
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,720
Hot tea..
- Okay.

332
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,920
Are you sure it is untapped.
- Hot tea..

333
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,040
Hot tea..

334
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,400
Hot tea sir.

335
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,520
Hot tea sir. - Tell me
something more about the story.

336
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
More means more about it.
- Take it sir.

337
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,440
What.
- Take it sir.

338
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,840
Okay political history.

339
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,320
I'll call you back.

340
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,720
Sit down.
- What happened, sir?

341
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,080
Wasn't morning tea nice?
- Sit down.

342
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,480
Were the tea leaves more?

343
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,680
I had told the people in the
pantry that sir has gastric problem.

344
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,040
Put the tea leaves less.

345
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,200
Sit down.
- Okay sir.

346
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,160
What is this?
- This is tea sir.

347
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,720
It is very nice.

348
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You are bringing tea
in every five minutes.

349
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,800
Give me time to drink tea.

350
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,040
Drink one more sir. It is very nice.

351
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,640
Tea is always hot and
people enjoy it while drinking.

352
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,840
Are you making me drink
tea or watering the plants?

353
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,440
Sir, you are getting angry.
You work so hard.

354
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,440
So you will drink more tea.

355
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,200
Drink it sir.

356
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,280
It is nice.

357
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,240
If you say it once again that it is
nice then I will press my throat or....

358
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,680
Don't get angry sir.

359
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,200
I will bring it later.

360
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,240
Don't bring it later.

361
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,600
Don't bring it.

362
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,600
You are a makeup and not a tea seller.

363
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,720
I don't understand
why are you after tea.

364
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,800
There is a difference between
profession and passion, sir.

365
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,800
You know it well that I love to make
others drink tea from college times.

366
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,000
Why are you spoiling your career?

367
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,320
I don't see a bright future.

368
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,760
You cannot make a career
by making others drink tea.

369
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,920
If you do hard work then one day
you will be in front of the camera.

370
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,600
Your mother wanted to see you on TV.

371
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,160
Yes sir.
She wants it but..

372
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,520
..what does she know about passion.

373
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,440
Sir, you don't seem
to be in god mood sir.

374
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,400
Oh really.

375
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,720
Are you getting angry with
me because of tasteless tea?

376
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,040
God, just kill me.

377
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,040
Today I will finish this debate.
- Okay.

378
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,800
Where is brother?

379
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,440
Where is brother?
- He is Ranchi?

380
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,600
Yesterday it came in the news.

381
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,640
Where is your brother, idiot.

382
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,720
That courier man.

383
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,840
Okay, choosy.

384
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,800
I will just call him, sir.
- Call him.

385
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,000
Hello.

386
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,760
Sorry Ajay,
I got caught up with some office work.

387
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,320
Tell me what you were saying.

388
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,520
Okay.

389
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,720
Yes..

390
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,640
Correct, correct..

391
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,320
Okay..

392
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,200
Yes, will see. Sir, Choosy..

393
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,280
Good afternoon sir.
Do you want to courier something?

394
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,000
Okay.

395
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:18,920
Right.

396
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,640
So send it till tomorrow.

397
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,680
Okay.

398
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,320
Sir, just say yes once.

399
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,480
Once you said yes means
your things have gone, sir.

400
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,280
I will call you in five minutes.
Boss has called me. Okay.

401
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,600
He has called me urgently. Bye.

402
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,200
Sir, did sister-in-law
get the bouquet?

403
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,760
Did you send it?

404
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,840
Listen.

405
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,880
Do whatever you feel is right.
I just have one request to make.

406
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,600
What sir?

407
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,320
You make me drink the
entire year's tea in one day.

408
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,920
After that you will
never make me drink tea.

409
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,240
Okay. And you.

410
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,320
This..

411
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,600
This is your border.

412
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,600
You will courier things of others..

413
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,160
..and you will not courier
anything inside this.

414
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,320
Swear it.

415
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,000
Okay sir.
- Not mine but yours.

416
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,160
Okay sir.
- Not of yours but of each other's.

417
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,560
Okay..
- Get lost from here.

418
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,600
Okay sir.

419
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,000
This is your limit.

420
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,200
I had told him..

421
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,520
..to make tea less strong

422
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,600
It is gas so it will
come out from somewhere.

423
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,680
You are right.

424
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,880
Yes Ajay, I was in a meeting.

425
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,720
Yes.

426
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,640
Any updates. Did Roy say anything?

427
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,440
Nothing new.

428
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,720
You tell me how your day was.

429
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,520
Crime Patrol 8 episodes.

430
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,920
Back to back.

431
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,480
Wow! Women crave for sweet
or sour things in pregnancy.

432
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,360
My wife has craving for crime.

433
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,760
Thank you God.

434
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,080
I am blessed.
- You are such a drama.

435
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,800
Such a drama. God.

436
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,080
In one episode there was a guy..

437
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,000
..who was caught stealing
bricks from the construction site.

438
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,880
Can you believe which
gang he belonged to?

439
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,120
No one told me.

440
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,600
D gang.

441
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,480
I mean imagine D gang
has to steal bricks.

442
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,920
What is so weird?
Many people of D gang are struggling.

443
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,640
Brother has escaped
and has left boys behind..

444
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,040
..to steal bricks and steel rods.

445
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,560
Anyways...

446
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,160
I have heard that he
is still active here. I mean..

447
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,000
People say he has
many investments here.

448
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,080
People say many things..

449
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,760
..but for me what matters
is that what you say.

450
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,680
Imagine..

451
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,320
..it would be so
cool to interview him.

452
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,240
I mean one on one
with the man himself.

453
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,160
Sensational.

454
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,560
Are you hypnotizing me?

455
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,160
You have already been hypnotized.

456
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,640
Keep these crime patrol
dangerous ideas with you.

457
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,720
Otherwise you will really
have to wear white sari.

458
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,080
You are such a buzz kill.

459
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,360
It did not go in the mouth.

460
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,320
Once more.
- Take this.

461
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,080
Clean it. I am going to bed.

462
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,080
I'll have two drinks and come.

463
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,680
Imagine it would be
so cool to interview him.

464
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,680
One on one with the man himself.

465
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,760
Sensational.

466
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,240
Parul.

467
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,920
Parul..

468
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,280
Baby..

469
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,440
What is it Arnab so late at night?
You scared me.

470
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,720
I came to compliment you.

471
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,080
For what?

472
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,240
You had give me a useless
idea to interview D.

473
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,120
So will you insult me
by waking me up from sleep?

474
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,720
No, it is not a bad idea at all.

475
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,200
Good for you.
- I am going to pitch it Roy.

476
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,040
All the best.

477
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
Are you excited?

478
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,800
Very much.

479
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,600
How did you like this idea?

480
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,720
What?

481
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,400
Is it risky?

482
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,320
Don't worry..

483
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,000
..your birth certificate
will have my name.

484
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,480
You tell me what I shall
get for you from there.

485
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,760
Gun.

486
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,720
They have the real one.

487
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,640
Sleep.

488
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,120
You are very naughty.

489
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,880
Remember that the flame
should not be high..

490
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
..otherwise the spoon
and wok both can burn.

491
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,640
Greetings, sir.

492
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,080
Greetings.

493
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,800
Sir, there is no
balance in your phone.

494
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,480
Do you want to get it recharged?

495
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,080
That will be done.

496
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,840
Smiling bright face.

497
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,280
Do you want to set a caller tune?

498
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,880
Black hair and golden color..

499
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,040
How is the weather there?

500
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,360
Shut up, idiot.

501
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,880
Girdhari, come quickly.
Brother is calling you at the pool.

502
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,000
How are you dear?

503
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,680
You do not miss me these days.

504
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Why should I miss you?

505
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,600
I have found someone here.

506
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,800
You uncle..

507
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,360
Okay.

508
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,560
Yes brother.

509
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,480
Go and kill Sheela.

510
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,280
Now. I want to hear
the sound of the bullet.

511
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,120
As you say, brother.
The work will be done.

512
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,800
Okay fine.

513
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,640
Girdhari.

514
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,680
Meet him.

515
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,000
He is the owner of GML group Mr.
Arshad Ansari.

516
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,920
Mr. Ansari.

517
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,640
He is Girdhari and
takes care of my work.

518
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,680
Greetings..

519
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,920
Don't go on his face.

520
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,440
He is innocent to look
at but he is very clever.

521
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,040
So brother, get my work
done about which I had told you.

522
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,000
Yes.

523
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,280
Girdhari.

524
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,720
He says that he had asked..

525
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,320
..to threaten the builder
but we have not called.

526
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,120
Yes.

527
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,440
Tell me from there.
Tell in front of everyone.

528
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,720
I don't like whispering in business.

529
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,800
Why are you shaking the phone?
Tell me what it is.

530
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,040
I did not have balance in the phone.

531
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,400
That is why I wanted
to tell you in your ears.

532
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,040
Are all other phones dead?

533
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,000
Where was Mehmood's phone?

534
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,680
Sir, Mehmood's phone
is not good quality.

535
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,240
There are so many landlines
in the house. What are they for?

536
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,920
Actually brother tele marketing
people have troubled..

537
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,840
..people so much that
they do not pick up landline.

538
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,400
I tried many times.

539
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,120
Mr. Ansari.

540
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,920
You go and your work will be done.

541
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,040
Don't bother about what he is talking.
He has the habit of eating opium.

542
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,120
Okay brother, now that you
are saying then it will be done.

543
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,200
You should have got it recharged.

544
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,560
Bother you do not know.

545
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,280
I have to beg for
100/- to the accountant..

546
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,640
..and he says there is no collection.
- One minute. One minute.

547
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,920
Is this enough for recharge?

548
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,440
Yes it is enough.

549
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,560
Brother.

550
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,640
For 10 days vegetables have
not been bought leave aside mutton.

551
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,400
Sprinkle salt on me and eat.

552
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,680
We are there because of you.

553
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,600
Sir.

554
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,200
Sir, I feel to increase the TRP..

555
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,440
..we will have to do
something path breaking.

556
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,400
Roy, you are going to thank me.

557
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,880
Yes, you were saying something Peter.

558
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,040
Sir. I think we will
have to do something new sir.

559
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,040
You say it every time but what new.

560
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:44,880
Sir.

561
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,480
You must have read what I had said.

562
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,040
Yes. What I had said?

563
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,080
I want to do something for women.

564
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,000
What is interesting in this?
Who will see?

565
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,120
Listen sir.

566
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,760
we will put an original twist in this.

567
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,920
I am listening.

568
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:04,720
The headlines of our news
piece would be 'Manch Pe Kiya Bawal'

569
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,560
I want to do women.

570
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,640
It would become a rage, sir.
- Great.

571
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,800
Very nice, very nice..

572
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,120
Later we will put all
the blame on the edit, sir.

573
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,640
Superb.
- We are safe.

574
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,880
There will not be
rage but riot, idiot.

575
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,880
Get out.

576
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,680
Good for nothing.

577
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,040
Sir..
- Out.

578
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,040
Okay.

579
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,320
So..
- Rajat, you were saying something.

580
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,320
Sir, Peter spoke my idea.

581
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,240
This always happens, sir. I
had come here to tell you about this.

582
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,880
Get out.
- Sir..

583
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,880
Get out.

584
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,800
Sir, my idea.
- Just leave.

585
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,320
Get out.

586
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,880
Go..

587
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,440
Our luck is not bad but
we have kept wrong people.

588
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,240
What is it? It was my idea.

589
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,840
Get lost.

590
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,520
Get lost.

591
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,440
It was my idea. Get lost.
- Rascal.

592
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,040
I will tell everyone
that it was my idea. Rascal...

593
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,640
Thief..
- Go and tell.

594
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,200
I have seen many people like you.

595
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,360
How did you like the idea?
- Rubbish idea.

596
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,040
What do you think, Neha?

597
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,040
Stupid, utter garbage
and I can go on and on..

598
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,520
Look, our luck is not bad.

599
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,920
What does Neha know?

600
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,320
Roy, I think you did
not hear it properly.

601
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,200
I heard it and imagined it in my mind.

602
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,840
At the end of imagination
I saw that we both are dead.

603
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,240
Hence.

604
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,280
Rubbish.

605
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,320
Roy, till today D
has not been interviewed.

606
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,720
This is going to be big.
- Big..

607
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,600
D has not been interviewed because
they are many reasons behind it.

608
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,640
He is dangerous, he is impossible.

609
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,440
This is a life risking idea.

610
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,720
Every big idea seems
to be risky in the beginning.

611
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,240
Don't be poetic.

612
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,480
I asked you to get idea
to save the channel and..

613
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,000
And this is what you come up with.

614
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,400
Tomorrow you would say that
you need Sayyed Hafiz's interview.

615
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,920
Day after tomorrow
you would say that..

616
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,760
..you need interview
of Veerappan's cousin.

617
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,320
Have you gone mad?

618
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,880
Roy, you are saying this? It is
not that no one has done this before.

619
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,280
Going by the history in 1959
the famous British..

620
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,800
..journalist Graham
Smith had done this.

621
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,000
Quite successfully.

622
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,040
Did he interview D?

623
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,640
In 1959 D was in nursery. Why would
anyone interview a nursery child?

624
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,600
He interviewed the famous
mafia king of Italy Fabio Castilana.

625
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,720
The one and only interview with him.

626
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,000
What happened of that
Graham Smith? He died.

627
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,920
Did you see?

628
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,160
He died of heart attack.
Natural death.

629
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,400
What to see in everything?

630
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,000
Whatever it was a bad idea.
Go out and get thinking.

631
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,440
And let me also think.

632
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,600
This plan of mine..
- Even you think it over Roy.

633
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,040
These TRP's and ratings
will be left behind.

634
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,280
This will make us legendary.

635
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,640
There will be no stopping us.

636
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,040
The door is that side. Forgive me.

637
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,120
Roy..Neha you tell him.
- I'll show you.

638
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,920
For the fashion segment..

639
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,600
Our luck is bad.

640
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,400
Will that be okay?

641
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,280
Good afternoon Mr. Chopra.

642
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,520
We are on it.
You don't have to worry sir.

643
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,080
Sir, I know I have said
this many times before..

644
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,040
..but this time I mean it sir.

645
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,920
I used to mean it earlier also
but all these things take time, sir.

646
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,360
I know I have less time sir.
Just 2 months.

647
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,880
Sir we are working on
some new ideas and I am sure..

648
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,880
..ratings will back up in no time.

649
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,480
Trust me sir.
We will turn things around.

650
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,080
Sir, you have already told
about this time of 2 months.

651
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,120
No, no sir I did not mean that.

652
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,160
You can say as many times as you want.

653
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,880
Okay, good day sir.

654
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,520
Yes Roy..

655
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,320
Arnab, go ahead with the interview.

656
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,240
I thought about your idea. Okay
but will what will happen with that.

657
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,080
I have ideas.

658
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,600
I am scared of those.

659
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,480
Listen to me. We will provoke him.

660
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,560
Okay. How?

661
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,080
What is D proud of the most?

662
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,840
Money, power, status and the
fact that people are scared of him.

663
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,080
Correct.
- So..

664
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,720
We will challenge him.

665
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,320
We will challenge everything.
Money, power, status and everything.

666
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,440
What will happen because of that?

667
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,800
That will make him angrier
and that is not good at all.

668
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,440
It will happen. I am telling you.

669
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,240
Just keep watching.

670
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,600
One minute, one minute..

671
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,200
I don't want the channel to
be in any danger, Arnab. Understood.

672
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,760
Wherever there is
Arnab there is danger..

673
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,160
..and wherever there
is danger there is Arnab.

674
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,000
Shut up.

675
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,320
I have this figured out. Come on.

676
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,280
Champion.

677
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,040
Okay.

678
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,720
Rami..
- Yes sir.

679
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,480
I was about to get tea.

680
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,520
Not tea but where is your brother?

681
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,160
He is here, sir. What happened?

682
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,120
Did he again couriered something?

683
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,040
No, no call him here in 2 minutes.

684
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,400
He will not be able
to come in 2 minutes.

685
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,000
Why?

686
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,600
Because he will come in 2 seconds.

687
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,760
He is here. Choosy.
- Greetings sir.

688
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,320
What are you doing here?

689
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,480
Sir, it had gone bad.
- Listen..

690
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,160
Okay.

691
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,040
Neha, where are you?

692
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,680
I need to see you immediately.

693
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,560
Okay, I am coming. Yes.

694
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,440
Parul should not come to
know about this. You know it, right.

695
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,560
That is about later.
First tell me that..

696
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,000
..why should I do it?

697
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,280
There is no scientific reason in it.

698
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,480
Just do it for old times' sake.

699
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,080
For old times' sake?
- Yes.

700
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,160
Last month when I had
asked a favor from you..

701
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,120
..then where had old times' gone.

702
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,880
You have gone mad.

703
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,520
You wanted to have sex with me.

704
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,720
And I am just telling you
to write the script of the interview.

705
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,800
There is a difference.
- What is the difference?

706
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,120
That time I was desperate
and today you are desperate.

707
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,120
By giving this stupid reason do not
prove yourself to be right, please.

708
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,040
And what the hell are you doing?

709
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,080
Okay I will write interview for you.

710
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:35,880
Thanks.

711
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,680
One minute, one minute..

712
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,480
That one minute has come.

713
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,600
Stop this striptease of yours first.

714
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,160
I have two conditions.

715
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,680
First that you will atke
me with you for the interview.

716
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,800
And you will mention
my name on live TV.

717
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,840
And give me credit for it.

718
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,720
What are you saying?
I am not interviewing a street dog.

719
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,680
Understand the seriousness of the
situation. I am going to interview D.

720
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,680
It is risky.

721
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,160
Okay, then I have other works also.

722
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,440
I'll see you in some time.

723
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,400
Listen, okay.

724
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,880
Good. Now second condition.

725
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,160
Now nothing. Done.

726
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,120
Nothing more.

727
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:29,600
After the interview
I want you for one night.

728
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,280
Are you crazy?

729
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,840
Just think it over.

730
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,480
This is the biggest
interview of your life.

731
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,520
I am India's biggest news writer.

732
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,200
No, no..

733
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,320
You can think over it and let me know.

734
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:49,080
Listen. Okay.

735
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,920
Really.

736
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,640
I have already put my life on stake
and now let it be my dignity as well.

737
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,880
I love you..you are my life

738
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:14,480
I am living because of you.

739
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I love you..you are my life

740
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,280
There is good news.
- Really.

741
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,880
I thought only I was
going to give good news.

742
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,120
I didn't know you also..

743
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,680
What?

744
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,840
Roy has agreed.

745
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,000
I am going to interview D.

746
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,280
What?
- Yes baby.

747
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,760
Oh my God.
That is so cool.

748
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,880
No, no..

749
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,480
Yes baby.
- No..

750
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,360
Yes..
- Go and do your work.

751
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,800
Go and get started.
Come on.

752
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,760
This is my work.
- Come on.

753
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,600
No, this is not your work.
That is your work, go.

754
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,400
Okay let me make a drink then.
- Okay.

755
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,640
I will have to be punished
for falling in love.

756
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,360
Today the weather is very pleasant.

757
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,840
What is this? Does the
vegetable cart look like this?

758
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,720
Fish and lady finger together.
What is this?

759
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:49,600
Madam, I have a rule and that..

760
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,720
..is I sell only female
things on my cart.

761
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,280
That is why fish with lady finger.

762
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,000
And colocasia with fish
and gourd with colocasia.

763
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,560
Do you want to say something else?

764
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,440
It will help in the
making of the video. Stupid.

765
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,520
What a coincidence madam.

766
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,880
The vegetables of my cart are
green and your dress is also green.

767
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,800
And I have become
excited on seeing you.

768
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,320
Shut up. Shut up.

769
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,760
The shoot has still
not started so be normal.

770
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,680
Uncle, you are getting too excited.
- One minute, one minute..

771
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,680
We are not sitting
in neighboring country.

772
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,440
India should be seen. India..

773
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,920
Is everything ready?
- Yes.

774
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,000
Do it nicely. Give me the mike.

775
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,400
Pull it.

776
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,920
Rolling..3, 2, 1..action.

777
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,800
At this time I am in
the vegetable market f Dongri.

778
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,880
Aslam uncle puts the biggest
cart of vegetables here.

779
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,080
He is with us.

780
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,120
Today he is put up a small cart.

781
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,320
Aslam uncle, shall we start if
the fishes have gained consciousness.

782
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,160
Yes sir.

783
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,600
We have heard that
famous underworld don D..

784
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,240
..used to buy vegetables from here.

785
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,440
Is this true?

786
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,680
But it. That rascal used
to never buy but take them for free.

787
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,720
So you mean to say such a great
underworld don D was a vegetable thief.

788
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,880
Which vegetables he used to steal?

789
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,920
I have a cart of 55 vegetables
but D always used to take spinach.

790
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,720
Oh! You want to say that
he was into green veggies.

791
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,320
No sir, green veggies were into D.

792
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,000
So you can speak Hindi Urdu.

793
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,520
Absolutely.
I mean he had a problem of piles.

794
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,480
You mean to say piles.

795
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,920
By changing words the
problem will not subside.

796
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,120
So by eating spinach piles are cured.

797
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,160
Not by eating sir but by applying.

798
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,920
As you saw Aslam uncle
said that for D it was..

799
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:48,680
..less of vegetable shop
and more of medical store.

800
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:53,040
To send your response
tweet

801
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,440
How much over acting do you do?

802
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,000
Let's go.

803
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,440
Sir, do you wish to say something
to Arnab about his media stand.

804
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,000
He definitely ahs some
connection with that D.

805
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,400
It is a game which they
both together are playing with me.

806
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,440
Sir, it is quite daring that
a reporter has openly challenged D.

807
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,760
Do you want to say something about it?

808
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,560
Please stay away. I don't
want to say anything about this.

809
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,480
Sir, Arnab insulted you so much and
still you do not want to say anything.

810
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,040
I said leave my way.

811
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,040
Please give me the answer, sir.
- Nonsense.

812
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,040
You are an inspector so sit straight.

813
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,560
Let me set your moustaches.

814
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,520
Madam..
- What?

815
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,520
I swear upon my mother..
- What?

816
00:44:54,600 --> 00:45:00,720
I mean I swear upon my mother that when
you touch my cheeks I seem to melt.

817
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,840
-Shut up.
-Come on let's start.

818
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,480
Are you ready?

819
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,600
Okay let's go.

820
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,520
At this time I am outside Nagpada
police station and we have with us..

821
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,200
..senior constable Dougle.
Come let us talk to him.

822
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,680
Mr. Dougle we have heard
that D has spent many..

823
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,640
..days in this police
station when he was young.

824
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,240
Not when he was young but he used
to come here even in his childhood.

825
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,320
Sometimes he used
to puncture the cycle..

826
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,120
..or sometimes break
the lock of the neighbors.

827
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,400
I swear he was a very
different kind of a person.

828
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,440
So you mean to say that D
has spent a lot of time in this jail.

829
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,360
Not only in jail but he has spent..

830
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,240
..a lot of time in
the 4*4 room next to that.

831
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,440
What happens there?

832
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,200
We try to improve new and
spoilt brats there with love.

833
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,240
Okay, so that means you
have thrashed D many times.

834
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,120
One time I let him go.

835
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,800
I thrashed him badly.
- Okay.

836
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,200
One day his father
brought him here to me.

837
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,560
Okay. Tell us more.

838
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,680
Rest all is fine. Wife is unwell.

839
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,840
Younger has failed in 10th std.

840
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,320
Rest all is well.

841
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,400
Tell about that girl. Stop overacting.

842
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,720
Yes..
- Yes tell..

843
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,440
I remember he was brought
here once for teasing a girl.

844
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,640
So D had teased a girl.

845
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,600
He did not tease but tried to.

846
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:16,080
The girl also thrashed him
and brought her to police station.

847
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,000
That day I felt pity on him.

848
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,560
I did not feel like thrashing him.

849
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,160
So you did not thrash D.

850
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,360
No sir. That day I came
here after fighting with wife.

851
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,040
Yes.

852
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,360
Does anyone put garlic in
potato and cauliflower vegetable?

853
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,160
Does anyone put?

854
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,880
No. My mood was very bad.

855
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,080
I slapped..

856
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:33,760
Your wife.

857
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,800
I dare not slap my wife.
But I slapped D.

858
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,240
Okay.
- Yes..

859
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,480
That day I really felt
like thrashing him hard.

860
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,400
I missed one and
hit him under the eye.

861
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,000
Oh.

862
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,920
He wears the glasses to
hide the mark given by my hand.

863
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,840
Many people do not know about it.

864
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,000
You just heard what Dougle said.

865
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:58,880
The mark of what he gave
D under the eye still remains.

866
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,640
The question is that mark still there.

867
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:06,160
Tweet your response
at

868
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,520
Brother..
- Yes, tell me.

869
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,520
How shall I speak? I am feeling shy.

870
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,240
What is the matter?
Have you got vasectomy done?

871
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,360
No, no what are you
talking brother. Oh no..

872
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,680
Oh God....

873
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:41,680
A chaos about you
is there on social media.

874
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,040
About what?

875
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,880
The video about you.

876
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:54,520
There is a vegetable seller
who says that you stole his vegetable.

877
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,320
There is a policeman who says that..

878
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,280
Don't be poetic. Tell me clearly.

879
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:05,840
Policeman is saying that
he had thrashed you hard.

880
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,280
That constable is saying so.

881
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:11,880
Show me the video.

882
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
No, no..

883
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,520
Show it to me.
- No..

884
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,120
What is this?
This seems to be ammunition shop.

885
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,880
This is new one.
Even I had not seen this.

886
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,920
At this moment I am with Mr.
Zuber proprietor of Zuber arms.

887
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,240
Mr. Zuber I am with you.

888
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,240
Tell me.

889
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,760
Did D buy the gun for
the first time from you?

890
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,440
Yes sir, we needed
gun oil to repair the guns.

891
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,760
The picture as well as sound is good.
- he used to supply.

892
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,440
What?

893
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,880
He used to supply.

894
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,840
He used to supply. So how long did
this association with him continued?

895
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,680
It could not continue for long
but the matter is that he used to..

896
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,000
..steal oil from Mahalaxmi
godown and sell us at cheaper rate.

897
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,520
This must have continued
for 2-3 months..

898
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,000
..and then what could have happened.

899
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,680
Mr. Dougle came and arrested him.

900
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,240
Okay.

901
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,080
He thrashed him so hard that after..

902
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,840
..that he was hardly
seen once or twice around.

903
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,080
What did you talk with him
whenever you saw him once or twice?

904
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,240
Just tell me that does
a man speak who is injured?

905
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:18,480
He wanted to speak a lot but
could not speak with swollen lips.

906
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,520
Did he speak?

907
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,080
No, he could not speak.
- Okay.

908
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:25,880
All he could say was that he
will not be able to do this business.

909
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:26,440
Okay.

910
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,600
When did he but the
first gun from you?

911
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,880
1989. he came here with two friends.

912
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,000
He came here to buy three
hand guns and two pistols.

913
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,000
What would have been the
cost of 3 hand guns and 2 pistols?

914
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,880
There was no sale.

915
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:46,600
There is a ground behind
our godown where guns are tested.

916
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,200
I took him there to get the test done.

917
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:53,040
Believe it or not but it seemed
as if he knew nothing about it.

918
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,000
He did not know
anything about the gun.

919
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,600
Even then he was adamant to shoot.

920
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,400
I asked him to shoot
as even I had to make sale.

921
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,080
Then he picked up the
gun and started shooting..

922
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:04,520
Yes..

923
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,600
..and because of the weight
of the gun the wrist got twisted.

924
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,800
And did not hit the aim.
- The aim had to miss.

925
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,080
Absolutely right, sir.

926
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,360
But he aimed at the
ceiling of nearby shop.

927
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,400
The ceiling fell
and three workers died.

928
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,200
Against his will D
committed his first murder.

929
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,800
Okay then what happened?

930
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,760
Then I asked him to
leave before any more died.

931
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:28,200
Then Mr. Dougle came and took him.

932
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,360
Then..

933
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,880
In this way D committed
his first murder.

934
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,160
To give your response tweet..

935
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:41,680
..

936
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,560
Who is he?

937
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,320
Find out Girdhari.
- Okay.

938
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,160
I will not spare him.

939
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,320
Be careful brother.
Your BP will shoot.

940
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,920
Find out. Find out..

941
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,040
Okay.

942
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,480
Brother that..

943
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,680
What?

944
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,400
There are two more videos.

945
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,560
Why are you laughing?

946
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,520
Because you were laughing brother.

947
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,360
Hello..
- Hello.

948
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:49,520
Before doing the daring you
should have thought about the dangers.

949
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,600
Who is speaking?

950
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,320
Since three days you
have created a chaos on..

951
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,920
..twitter and you do
not know who I am speaking.

952
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:55,760
D.

953
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,200
Will D personally call you?

954
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,160
So who is speaking?

955
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,480
It is not important who I am speaking.

956
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:06,040
It is important that
you stop your drama.

957
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,000
Otherwise we will not
take much time to finish you.

958
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,640
This drama will not stop.

959
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,480
India is a free country
and we have the..

960
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,080
..right to speak and
show anything we wish to.

961
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,800
Hey, free country.

962
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,120
Keep a finger on the globe.

963
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,480
Every country is there
but none is free for us.

964
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,360
Whatever you are showing
is false so stop it.

965
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,640
What is wrong in that?

966
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,800
If you believe vegetable seller
and constable then everything is true.

967
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,040
Understand that you
and your actors will die.

968
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,400
You do not understand.
This drama will not end.

969
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,440
Kill me if you wish to.

970
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,400
What will you achieve by killing me.

971
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,680
Look, if one incident happens on social
media then its impact is for long.

972
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Your brother is going
to be insulted for sure.

973
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,440
Yes, there is one option.

974
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,280
Quiet. Are you playing KBC with me?

975
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,840
Ask brother to give
me personal interview.

976
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,280
Whatever he wishes to
justify say in that interview.

977
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,240
I take the responsibility
of telecasting that interview.

978
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:00,920
Okay..

979
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,080
Hey you rascal..

980
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,800
Don't curse me but do me this favor.

981
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,400
Now call me next time only when
brother agrees for interview. Okay.

982
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,680
Hey hello..

983
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:32,000
So he has created all
this chaos for the interview.

984
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,120
Yes brother.

985
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,680
Say yes.

986
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,880
What are you saying?

987
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,400
Say yes to him.
How?

988
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,320
It is an opportunity Girdhari.
Enough of playing jokes.

989
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,640
Those who were scared till
yesterday are laughing today.

990
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:59,160
Everyone should know
that D means fear.

991
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,200
That means D you will
give interview and come on TV.

992
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,520
Bringing him here
would create trouble.

993
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,160
There is a security risk.

994
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,680
There is no security risk Girdhari.

995
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,400
He has just to be brought here.

996
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,040
What do you mean?

997
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,800
I mean you say yes
to him for the interview..

998
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,760
..and I will kill him live on TV.

999
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,280

Okay, Bhendi Bazaar.
But where in Bhendi Bazaar?

1008
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,000
Ask for 100gms cardamom

1009
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,040

I hope you had no problem
in understanding the route. - No..

1017
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,200
Look at this cardamom.

1018
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,240
I had called for it.

1019
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,040
It was finished at home.

1020
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,000
It will be of use
to make rice pudding.

1021
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,320
You just have to take 4 people there.

1022
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,760
Tell me before hand.

1023
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,520
Take this.
- What is this?

1024
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:12,240
These are your tickets. Do
not open them before reaching there.

1025
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,800
You must have understood
that Haftaa brother has sent this.

1026
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,200
But how will we go?

1027
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,440
There is a Bahid village
near Bikaner in Rajasthan.

1028
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,920
Reach there at 4 in the afternoon
there day after tomorrow.

1029
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,320
Near kali Mata Chowk
you will find a tea stall.

1030
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,480
Order for Udta Chicken
and Bullet Chaat.

1031
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,920

00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,520
Coffee With D

1033
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,240
If you want to live
then drink coffee with D

1034
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:48,520
If you want to live
then drink coffee with D

1035
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,360
Brother we got message
of Hafta brother.

1036
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,160
The boys are right.

1037
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:10,080
Won't you blindfold us
so that we cannot see the way?

1038
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,040
There is no problem if you see..

1039
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,880
..because you will not
be able to see while returning.

1040
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,680
Why?

1041
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,720
Because while returning
you will be in chicken bag.

1042
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,560
Coffee With D.

1043
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,160
Okay, who is Arnab?

1044
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,560
Okay, okay.

1045
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:39,360
Hey, what are you selling nowadays,
vegetable seller?

1046
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,120
I don't have a shop.
I am a makeup man sir.

1047
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,480
Okay, keep quiet vegetable seller.

1048
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,640
Hey madam, no photo.
- Why?

1049
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,600
Keep your mobile inside.

1050
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,160
No photo.
- Sorry.

1051
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,920
You seemed to be very brave
on the phone the other day.

1052
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,800
I felt as if you would
kill me there and then.

1053
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,920
Today you seemed to be tensed.

1054
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:00,000
I had to reach you otherwise I
am worth nothing in front of you all.

1055
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:00,840
What do you mean?

1056
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,440
I mean will D sir
meet us now or later?

1057
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,760
He will meet you later.

1058
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,720
Is she your wife?
- No.

1059
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,640
Is she your sister?
- No.

1060
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,920
I am Girdhari.

1061
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,080
Either shake hands or give me the bag.

1062
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,840
Hello.

I do not know anything.

1068
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,080
I am saying truth.
- Egg and bread.

1069
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:42,640
I don't want.

1070
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,520

Come on move...

00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,440
Not that side but come this side.

1082
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,400
Ask her to pick up.

1083
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,480
Come on get inside.
- Come on.

1084
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,000
Come on.
- be careful of knife.

1085
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:24,640
Hello.

1086
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,800
You should have been
director in CBI Mr. Roy.

1087
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Who is this?

1088
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,160
I am director of CBI speaking fool.

1089
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:34,120
Is there some legal matter that
you have sent your people to Pakistan?

1090
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,920
Sorry sir. I made a mistake.

1091
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,920
I was about to call
you and then I realized..

1092
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,440
..that you will talk that nonsense.

1093
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,760
Get the phone of D tapped.

1094
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,520
Or send some of his internal photos.

1095
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,800
Or give him posion.

1096
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,560
My boy would have got
distracted from his work, sir.

1097
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,240
You do not know what
foolishness have you done.

1098
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:00,760
Sir if we do the work that you cannot
do then it is called foolishness.

1099
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,840
This is wrong, sir.

1100
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,040
You idiot.
Do you know what you have done?

1101
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,520
Because of this..
- I am sorry sir.

1102
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,240
I will have to keep the phone.
There is lots of work here.

1103
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,600
Sir we will talk
at ease some other time.

1104
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,840
Why don't you do one thing?
Come to our studio.

1105
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,320
We will take your interview as well.
- What..

1106
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,360
Okay sir.
- Idiot.

1107
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,480
I know that you are scared.

1108
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,680
Anyways there is nothing
to be scared of as..

1109
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,040
I do not unnecessarily
raise hand on someone.

1110
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:28,120
Hey, can't you see it is a carpet.

1111
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,160
How dare you bring dirty shoes inside?

1112
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,560
Hey, I think you do
not know whose men are we.

1113
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,560
Idiot, you are the men of that person
who sells cardamom in Bhendi bazaar.

1114
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:42,040
And my husband has personally gone
to meet the person for whom he works.

1115
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,840
Now you see what is your standing?

1116
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,120
Keep the shoes away and sit down.
- Okay.

1117
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,480
I am saying that..

1118
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,640
First remove your shoes.
- Remove them, remove them..

1119
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,440
Okay, okay..

1120
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:59,120
Hey beautiful,
you are taking us too lightly.

1121
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,160
Do you know what is this?
- It is a shoe.

1122
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,120
Brother, gun.
Since long we were playing with knife.

1123
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:13,440
Keep it straight.
- Do you know this is real gun?

1124
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,920
Keep it on the side
otherwise you may shoot.

1125
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,920
Why?

1126
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,600
If you shoot then
this bulb will burst.

1127
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,000
And if I shoot then God forbid even
I don't know what will happen of you.

1128
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:30,000
I think I will have to
take permission to kill you.

1129
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,520
Is it correct?
- It is correct.

1130
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,800
Hello.
- Tell me.

1131
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,160
What kind of female is she?

1132
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,120
She is saying that she
will kill me with my gun.

1133
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,720
Make her understand who I am?

1134
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,880
Who I am?

1135
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,680
Who I am?

1136
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,800
Who I am?

1137
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,080
Tell me who I am?

1138
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,880
Don't mess up. You just have
to keep a watch and nothing else.

1139
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,280
Okay, good that we talked to you.

1140
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:00,040
Otherwise you know that
if would have got angry..

1141
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:03,040
..this woman must have died by now.

1142
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,720
Surely.
- Ameen.

1143
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:10,320
Forget it. You cannot kill a
mosquito and you are talking so great.

1144
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,760
Just keep a watch quietly
and for god sake..

1145
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,560
..don't get insulted anymore.
- He is praising me.

1146
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,000
Keep quiet.

1147
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,080
Brother, listen to me.
- I don't want to hear anything.

1148
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,320
Hey Afshaab.
-Yes.

1149
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,200
Make them understand.
They are creating too much problem.

1150
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,440
They do not know basic hygiene.

1151
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,040
He came with dirty
shoes on the carpet.

1152
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,520
And the other one has
spread the smell of tobacco..

1153
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,320
..which he is chewing continuously.

1154
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,600
He eats a lot of tobacco.

1155
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,240
So make him understand.

1156
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,600
Is this the way to behave
in the house of sophisticated people?

1157
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:46,360
One thing more. Tell then
not do any drama in front of me.

1158
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,000
I know they have just
come to keep a watch.

1159
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,520
They have no orders to do anything
nor do they have that status.

1160
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:00,360
Everyone knows Crime
Patrol Episode 591 Season 2

1161
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,160
Watch it on you tube.
I shall keep the phone.

1162
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:03,680
Take it.

1163
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,000
She sees crime patrol.
- okay, come on.

1164
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,600
I beg of you. Please..

1165
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:21,600
It is matter of my dignity.
Please get scared a bit.

1166
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,320
Let me make a video, please.

1167
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,000
What is there?

1168
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,040
Shall I say something?

1169
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,600
Is it done?
Video..

1170
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:32,800
Okay do.

1171
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,560
Get scared a bit.

1172
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,480
Arnab I am feeling very scared.

1173
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:39,240
Arnab, they have kidnapped me.
Please save me Arnab.

1174
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,520
Please I am very scared.

1175
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:49,240
Arnab, they are holding my hand.
Please save me.

1176
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,680
Leave me.

1177
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,040
Enough.
- Get lost. Enough of it.

1178
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,120
Brother has made a nice house.

1179
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,160
The place where you are standing..

1180
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,720
Is there a bomb there?
- No, no..

1181
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,880
Those are Italian tiles. Imported.

1182
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,680
Is it good?
- Nice.

1183
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:18,840
Can you see that?

1184
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:22,160
Brother cut the hand
of the person who made it.

1185
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:24,520
Why?

1186
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,440
A masterpiece remains a
masterpiece only when one is made.

1187
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,360
Like Shah Jahan.
- Yes.

1188
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,440
Till when will sir do interview?

1189
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,120
Interview?

1190
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,320
Eat something and then
we will do interview.

1191
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,880
What will you have vegetarian
or non vegetarian food.

1192
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:37,760
Nothing..

1193
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,240
Eat something.

1194
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,520
We had chicken on the way.

1195
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:41,760
Okay.

1196
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:47,760
We have a tradition that
before killing the goat we feed him.

1197
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:49,920
Food.

1198
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:54,480
How did you like the house?
- Nice.

1199
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,120
Is it nice?

1200
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,160
The house in which you live
in Mumbai is rented or your own.

1201
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,040
It is on EMI

1202
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,760
That house is also nice.

1203
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,320
Curtains are also nice.

1204
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,160
Sister-in-law is also beautiful.

1205
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:13,720
You are very fond of making
comedy videos and showing them.

1206
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,800
Watch a thriller now.
- Arnab, he is holding my hand.

1207
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,360
Please save me..

1208
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,080
Don't do this. What are you doing?

1209
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:21,920
Leave me.

1210
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,760
Nothing will happen. Don't worry
nothing will happen to sister-in-law.

1211
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,560
This is just a teaser.

1212
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,000
This is for the simple
reason that you do not..

1213
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:31,560
..misbehave while taking
interview with brother.

1214
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:36,400
Otherwise we will get sequel 1,
2, 3 of it.

1215
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:40,280
Nothing will happen to her.
This is just for reference.

1216
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,000
Where is he?

1217
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,920
Rumy. There he is.

1218
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,760
Okay..
- Where is..

1219
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:49,760
Bathroom. This side.

1220
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,760
Come, will you have tea?

1221
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,560
Yes, I am very fond of tea.

1222
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,480
Make me drink nice tea.
- Tanveer, get tasty tea.

1223
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,600
And how am I looking?

1224
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,840
You are looking very nice.

1225
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,600
Do little bit of what you do.
- Makeup.

1226
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:07,360
Yes.

1227
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,360
So will you also go
on air for the interview?

1228
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,720
On air.

1229
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,880
That means brother
will go on air as well.

1230
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,600
No, through satellite direct on TV.

1231
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:19,880
Yes, yes I will come.
Call that cameraman.

1232
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,640
Choosy, come here.

1233
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:23,480
Yes tell me.
- Come here.

1234
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,000
Am I looking okay?
- Nice, absolutely nice.

1235
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,200
Come this side.

1236
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:30,360
I am cracking jokes
so shoot that in camera.

1237
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:32,000
Record.
- Yes.

1238
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:33,200
Shall I speak?

1239
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:34,320
Yes speak.

1240
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:35,680
There was a man..

1241
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:39,200
..who was taking his
newlywed wife on a horse cart.

1242
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,360
Okay.
- Yes.

1243
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,480
A stone came under
the foot of the horse..

1244
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,280
..and he shook with jerk.

1245
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,120
The wife also got jerk.

1246
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,160
The man said one.
- Yes.

1247
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,720
After some time the
horse again got a jerk.

1248
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,160
The wife shook and the man said two.
- Two.

1249
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,920
They went a little ahead.
The same stone and jerk.

1250
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:02,560
The man took out the
gun and shot at the horse.

1251
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:06,600
The wife shouted that
how merciless you are.

1252
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,840
Does anyone kill an
innocent animal in this way?

1253
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,240
The man said one.

1254
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:13,760
How was it?

1255
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,800
Nice, nice..
- Then laugh.

1256
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:18,200
Nice..
- Now show how it has come.

1257
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,120
Look brother.

1258
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,080
It has come nice.
Nice. Now do that to it.

1259
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,080
Delete..
- No..

1260
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:26,400
Photohop..

1261
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,680
Upload.

1262
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,920
What do you do as you
did of brother's video?

1263
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,600
Okay, upload it on facebook.
- Yes.

1264
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,920
Yes, do that.
- Okay upload it on facebook.

1265
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,400
Make an infection of it.

1266
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,480
It is not a viral or mosquito
that I make infection of it.

1267
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,760
How did you spread
the video of brother?

1268
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,000
Okay Viral..

1269
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,880
Yes, that.. now make it viral..

1270
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,120
Yes..
- Okay we will do it.

1271
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,560
Neha.

1272
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,200
I just cracked a joke so listen to it.

1273
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,160
Thanks but no thanks.

1274
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,720
It is nice and you will enjoy it.

1275
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,240
No, I don't listen much to jokes.

1276
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,720
Then shall I narrate
something serious?

1277
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,080
I am okay. Thanks.

1278
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,880
I swear it is very hot.

1279
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,080
What?

1280
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,200
Tea.

1281
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,400
Isn't it?
Yes it is hot.

1282
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:13,320
Please have tea.
- No, I am okay.

1283
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,520
Really, thank you.

1284
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,600
Come on Rumy, going to be on air.

1285
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,160
Come on.
I am giving you with love.

1286
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,320
Okay please...

1287
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:20,320
Please take it.

1288
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,160
No thanks.
- Come on.

1289
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,680
""Tell me what should I do?""

1290
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,840
""At the back is fear and
death is standing in front.""

1291
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,000
""Tell me what should I do?""

1292
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,880
""At the back is fear and
death is standing in front.""

1293
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,760
Hey Sarwa, just because
of an interview with hooligan..

1294
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,560
..the entire society
has become chaotic.

1295
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,480
Sarwa, he is sitting in Karachi..

1296
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:01,480
..and here in Mumbai because
of his name he has created confusion.

1297
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:02,920
Look, how people are running.

1298
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,480
Hey, don't call him a hooligan.
Call him Don.

1299
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,800
Call him Don.

1300
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:13,440
""If you have the courage
to live then drink Coffee With D.""

1301
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:20,200
""If you have the courage
to live then drink Coffee With D.""

1302
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,880
""Coffee With D.""

1303
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,280
""Coffee With D.""
- You are getting nervous..

1304
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:29,720
..and you are making me nervous too.
- Just finish this.

1305
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:30,920
Okay, okay..

1306
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,680
Okay.
- Yeah.

1307
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,680
Okay, let us start.
- Okay.

1308
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:35,720
Yeah.

1309
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:40,400
Ready 3, 2..

1310
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:42,640
One minute..

1311
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:47,280
Mr. Girdhari, ask brother to
change the shirt. What is he wearing?

1312
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,280
It will create so
much jitter on camera.

1313
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:50,320
What? Who will kill?

1314
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:51,880
No, no one minute..

1315
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,440
Will you kill brother?
- No, no..

1316
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:54,320
He said jitter.

1317
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,000
It is hot outside so
he is becoming irritable.

1318
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,360
Has glitter come to kill him?

1319
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,800
Shirt is absolutely fine.
- Okay.

1320
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:01,680
Please sit down.

1321
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,400
Quiet.
- What sir?

1322
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:06,160
Okay.

1323
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:11,120
Alright going live. 3. 2, 1..

1324
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:19,400
Welcome and good evening
to One On One with me Arnab Ghosh.

1325
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,880
Today's interview is
special for two reasons.

1326
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,920
One, the person whom I am
going to interview is camera shy.

1327
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:28,760
He has not given interview
to anyone despite the fact..

1328
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,840
..that he has done such
works that the world's police..

1329
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,520
I mean media wants to interview him.

1330
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,600
Secondly it is my birthday..

1331
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,520
..so it might be the
last interview of my life.

1332
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,120
Jokes apart.

1333
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,840
I like to introduce you to the man..

1334
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:50,800
..the myth and the most
wanted outlaw of the world D.

1335
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,760
So I am giving you interview at last.

1336
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,560
At least one of your ill
feelings are taken care of.

1337
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,800
Today you are not giving
interview but I am taking it.

1338
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,840
Come on let's start again.

1339
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,160
Greetings Mr. D.

1340
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,400
Greetings.

1341
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,160
Brother..
- Where, where..

1342
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:37,920
On TV.

1343
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:42,360
Brother, brother.. worry not.

1344
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:44,920
I will not spare her. Hey.

1345
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,480
Brother.

1346
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:54,520
Doesn't your channel have
any news to show other than me?

1347
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:57,600
We have. But you do such big things.

1348
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,440
You must have seen those videos.
- I have seen..

1349
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:04,120
..and recognize some of the actors.

1350
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:10,240
What are you saying Mr. D? Those
are the real videos of real people.

1351
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,720
Don't call me Mr. but brother.
It brings us closer.

1352
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,560
By addressing me Mr.
I get the feel of enmity.

1353
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,240
Anyway your stories are
like drugs to the Indians.

1354
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:19,280
We can't help it.

1355
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:23,520
So you mean I should give drug as
well as entertainment brother Arnab.

1356
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,800
Call me Mr. Arnab.

1357
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,840
By calling me brother
I get the feel of hooligan.

1358
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:31,200
And it is not entertainment.
It is called news.

1359
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,360
Okay.

1360
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,880
Brother Girdhari.

1361
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,640
Girdhari, did I hear it correctly?

1362
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,080
Yes, Girdhari.

1363
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:45,920
Lovingly I call him Girdhari
Secular and he is my main associate.

1364
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:51,400
In your language he is CEO,
my main man.

1365
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,560
And she is my main lady.

1366
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,400
But Girdhari..
I am surprised that your CEO is a..

1367
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:02,160
Don't go to that side..

1368
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,760
..otherwise the interview
will become like that..

1369
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,200
What do you mean? How will it be?

1370
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:08,640
Like a nonsense political rally.

1371
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:13,160
As you wish otherwise honestly
I am interested in going there.

1372
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:17,200
Girdhari...
- Yes, brother.

1373
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,880
What news did last week come
about me on their news channel?

1374
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,720
Breaking news.

1375
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,800
Brother they had said that for..

1376
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:34,640
..you have come to Bangkok because
Pakistan does not have this facility.

1377
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,000
Yes.

1378
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:39,720
Yes. Now tell me brother
Arnab is this right?

1379
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
For last three months I
have not moved from this place.

1380
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,200
There is nothing great in this.

1381
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,840
That day Pakistan
bashing was necessary.

1382
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:52,040
Population control guys
wanted to run a story for them.

1383
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:55,680
And more rumors of you being
in Pakistan or not continue.

1384
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,560
Yes so. I did not understand anything.

1385
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,160
We had fewer slots.

1386
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:03,840
So chief editor covered
three stories in single news.

1387
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,520
You must have heard the headlines.

1388
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,280
No facility in Pakistan..D
had to go to Bangkok.

1389
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,400
What's wrong with that?

1390
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,400
You should have called
the chief editor as well.

1391
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,560
Brother, may I ask you a question?
- Yes.

1392
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,680
I hope you will let
me go alive from here.

1393
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:29,920
Do you have any doubt?

1394
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,720
I am sure that you will
not do anything like that.

1395
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:34,440
What will I not do?

1396
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:35,880
Cheap hooligan acts.

1397
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:46,080
Brother, firstly I would
like to ask you that..

1398
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:48,480
..how did you become
such a big gangster?

1399
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,080
You have said it once
so dare not say it again.

1400
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,760
I am not gangster..

1401
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:57,560
..but a Don.

1402
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,120
What did you understand?
- Okay, what is the difference?

1403
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,360
Have you ever seen shootout on roads?

1404
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,320
Not really but have heard from police.

1405
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:10,200
Those involved in
shootout are gangsters.

1406
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:11,360
And don?

1407
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:16,480
Have you ever heard about the
mastermind behind these shootouts?

1408
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,160
Not really. Have heard rumors.

1409
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:24,360
So Don is the mastermind
about whom you have heard rumors.

1410
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:28,240
So basically how did you become Don?

1411
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,160
Any problem sir.
- No problem.

1412
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:40,640
Actually I had a desire
of doing business from childhood.

1413
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,680
But business can be of any kind.

1414
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:45,680
Construction, production,
transportation, real estate etc.

1415
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:48,640
So what do you think all
these are not my businesses?

1416
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,600
Let's not get involved in what I feel.

1417
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,840
Otherwise this interview
will have pre mature climax.

1418
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,560
Where did you begin from?

1419
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,520
Actually I was multi
talented from childhood.

1420
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:01,520
What is the called? All rounder.

1421
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:05,040
But my father had problem with this.

1422
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,200
So you mean to say that
the reason you became a Don..

1423
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,840
..are the unresolved father issues.

1424
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,000
What?

1425
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,040
Only one person is responsible..

1426
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:20,640
..for me to become Don and that is I.

1427
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,800
What did you understand?
- You are right.

1428
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:26,040
What a stupid question on my part?

1429
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:29,040
Which father would want his
son to become a Don after growing up?

1430
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,920
Even you are right?

1431
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:35,040
Which channel would want
his best reporter to die untimely?

1432
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:43,680
Let's come to your question?

1433
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:48,200
Actually I loved
cricket from childhood.

1434
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,840
I was short height with
heavy body so could not play.

1435
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:56,560
But my instincts were very strong.

1436
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:02,600
In your language 'Mann Ki Baat'

1437
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:07,440
So from childhood you got
involved in match fixing and betting.

1438
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,200
I said four it was four.

1439
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,680
I said six it was a six.

1440
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:27,160
I said out it was out.

1441
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:30,880
So basically you want to say
that your gut feeling was very strong.

1442
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,360
Yes, in the beginning.

1443
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:35,080
Afterwards there
was no need of gut feel.

1444
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,400
Sorry, I did not understand.

1445
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:40,280
Ask something else.
Ask something interesting.

1446
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:44,200
So you are saying that you
have nothing to do with match fixing.

1447
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:47,720
The entire world knows this D.
you cannot deny this.

1448
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,120
Your photographs
are seen in the stadium.

1449
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,480
How can you say this?

1450
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,240
Photo.
- Yes.

1451
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,280
Photographs are seen
of film stars on grant road..

1452
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:58,560
..so that means all
of them are prostitutes.

1453
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:02,400
Photo of politicians is also
there in from Amar Jawan Jyoti..

1454
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:03,480
..so all of them are patriots.

1455
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:04,640
What are you talking, brother Arnab?

1456
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:07,080
So where did all rumors come from?

1457
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,880
Actually I had friendship
with few players.

1458
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:14,360
Some had difficulty in
affording two girlfriends.

1459
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,280
Some had to repay education loan.

1460
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:18,200
I use to help them.

1461
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:20,360
Oh I see and in return.

1462
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:23,280
In return they used to help me.
What else?

1463
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,040
Now..

1464
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:29,360
If every batsman will
make 100 in every match then..

1465
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,320
..how will rest of
the talent get a chance?

1466
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,880
Growth should be inclusive.

1467
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:39,040
That means whatever
we saw on TV screens..

1468
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,000
..was actually remote
controlled by you.

1469
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:44,200
Hey, you are unnecessarily
exaggerating things.

1470
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,720
So many times..

1471
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:55,320
..I have told the players
to make 100 in a match.

1472
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,520
For which country?
- My country.

1473
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,000
What do you mean by my country?
- My country means my country.

1474
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:03,440
That's all very fine
but why don't you take a name?

1475
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:06,640
What is there in a name,
brother Arnab?

1476
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:09,560
A country is not made
by name but with people.

1477
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,040
What did you understand?
- Okay.

1478
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,120
So you were talking
about your talents.

1479
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,200
Yes.

1480
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,720
Other than cricket
I loved movies also.

1481
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:21,520
But I had two weaknesses
with regard to movies.

1482
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,920
One I cannot wait till the
movie is released in cinema halls.

1483
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,160
Secondly..

1484
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,080
..I cannot enjoy movie alone.

1485
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:35,040
If the movie is nice it
should reach everyone. Isn't it?

1486
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:38,400
Okay, so that is
why you started piracy.

1487
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,440
Piracy?

1488
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:42,440
What does that mean, Girdhari?

1489
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:48,280
I used to travel the world.

1490
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:52,400
Wherever I saw a nice movie
I used to make one copy of it.

1491
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,840
Did you understand? - So
this according to you is not piracy.

1492
01:19:54,920 --> 01:20:00,560
Not forcefully, Arnab but with love.

1493
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,880
Sometimes France and sometimes Cannes.

1494
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,280
France and Cannes are the same Mr. D.

1495
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:08,000
You understood it so
why are you going in detail.

1496
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,080
So basically you picked
up a print from festivals.

1497
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,520
Picked up?

1498
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,800
Men are kidnapped.

1499
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,560
Have you ever heard
that the film was kidnapped?

1500
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,480
No, Have you heard?

1501
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,120
A question to your passion for movies.

1502
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:26,400
Do you invest in Bollywood?
- No.

1503
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:28,560
A lot of people believe that you do.

1504
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:32,160
And you have a huge
piracy racket that causes..

1505
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:35,560
..losses worth crores
to film industry every year.

1506
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,120
Which losses?

1507
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:39,680
Which losses?

1508
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,560
First tell me where is my money?

1509
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:44,040
Which money of yours?

1510
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:48,800
The money that I should get
on every film that is based on me.

1511
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,240
Should I get it or not?

1512
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:52,600
Intellectual property.

1513
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,000
I am sure everyone wants
to know what your real business is.

1514
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:00,720
Smuggling,
extortion, horse racing or what..

1515
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:02,280
Nothing out of this.

1516
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:05,560
Basically you are unemployed.

1517
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:07,680
Shall I ask you
something brother Arnab?

1518
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:13,680
Begal family in America,
Gonzalis family in South America..

1519
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:16,040
..and there are so
many names in Italy.

1520
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,840
You will keep counting till evening.

1521
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:21,640
All these people work
according to their wish.

1522
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:24,720
Why do you have..

1523
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,840
..special interest in me?

1524
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:31,560
What special have they done
that no one says anything to them.

1525
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:33,480
Mr. D you are evading my question.

1526
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,560
Are you saying that
you don't do smuggling?

1527
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:39,400
Hey buddy, I am service provider.

1528
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,360
Service provider.

1529
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:47,320
Transport service,
courier service, mobile service..

1530
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,080
From mobile service
I remember one thing.

1531
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:54,200
Tell me one thing if a person
calls from an airtel number..

1532
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:57,560
..and do kidnapping then
what is the fault of airtel.

1533
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:00,920
You said courier service. So
that means are you dominoes of drugs.

1534
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:05,000
Your question has two words
which I did not understand.

1535
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:05,760
Okay.

1536
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,040
If you are a service provider..

1537
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:11,200
..then why don't you openly
do business just like others?

1538
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,560
I work openly.

1539
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:17,760
You tell me how much material
you want me to send to your house.

1540
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:21,600
I never meant that.

1541
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:25,640
Leave it.

1542
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,040
What about extortion?

1543
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,680
I swear upon God..

1544
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,440
..till today I have not
got anyone's child aborted.

1545
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:36,040
Mr. D I am not talking
about abortion but of extortion.

1546
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:39,720
Okay, what is the meaning of this?
I do not know its meaning.

1547
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:43,000
Actor..he understands
intellectual property..

1548
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,920
..but does not understand extortion.

1549
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,560
Extortion means to obtain
money through force or threat.

1550
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:49,920
Amazing.

1551
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:53,680
Why do people come to
the point of force and threat?

1552
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,120
What is my fault in this?

1553
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:58,240
So you do agree that
you extract money from people.

1554
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:01,480
If I provide service then
will surely give the bill.

1555
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:05,040
Do you take salary from
the channel to do this show?

1556
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:09,240
Okay Mr. D I think you are
not in mood to give direct answers.

1557
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:11,360
Let's shift to some lighter questions.

1558
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:16,000
You have already shifted
from brother to Mr. D

1559
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:19,600
Even you have shifted from Mr.
Arnab to brother Arnab.

1560
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,720
Who is your favorite actor?

1561
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:29,200
Bruce Wills and Sylvester Stallone.

1562
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:30,880
So you see Hollywood as well.

1563
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,200
I see only Hollywood.

1564
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:34,480
That is strange but why not Bollywood.

1565
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:36,480
I don't like movies from South and..

1566
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,800
..you do not make
anything else except that.

1567
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:41,040
Who is your favorite heroine?

1568
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:42,840
No one is nice in your country.

1569
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:45,640
Some have fake lips,
some do not know Hindi..

1570
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,240
..and if you see someone
without make up..

1571
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:48,800
..then you would get paralysis attack.

1572
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,200
Where do you get all these from?

1573
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,880
Okay, so who do you like?

1574
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,640
Nazreena..
- But she is from Bollywood.

1575
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:02,520
She is in Bollywood now. Her
actual work started in New York's bar.

1576
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,040
Mr. D this is a family show..

1577
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:08,280
..so it would be better if
you keep your responses censored.

1578
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:11,360
If you were to do family show
then why are you interviewing me?

1579
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:14,000
You should have done of
Sooraj Barjatya or Raju Hirani.

1580
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:17,600
Believe me I tried for that
but they are busier than you nowadays.

1581
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:19,880
Shall I arrange by calling them now?

1582
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:24,400
Anyway, other than
Hollywood what do you like?

1583
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:27,920
Other than Hollywood
I like to see porn.

1584
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:33,840
There is no story in this as well
in that but action is surely there.

1585
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:37,600
But nowadays many such movies
are being made in Bollywood..

1586
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,120
..where there is so much action.

1587
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:43,560
For example Jism 2, Ragini MMS 2
Extreme action.

1588
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:46,080
So you had to get a porn star.

1589
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:52,600
Okay, With that we take a short break.
Stay with us we will just be back.

1590
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:02,440
Special LIV-IN condoms. Made from
Nigeria's special 4N TCM polyster.

1591
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,240
You need not remove it.

1592
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,800
You never know when
you would get a chance.

1593
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:10,800
It adjusts according to your size.

1594
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:15,760
So that at the time
of need you are ready.

1595
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:20,120
LIV-In condoms. Keep wearing it.

1596
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:21,360
Don't remove it.

1597
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,680
Welcome back. I am still with D.

1598
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,360
A man who is not
ready to give answer..

1599
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:28,720
..but we are trying
to find answers from him.

1600
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:34,560
Sir, tell me something about
your journey from Mumbai to here.

1601
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:37,440
Not Mumbai.

1602
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:39,480
Okay, sure.

1603
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:41,800
That reminds me.

1604
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,600
I received a call yesterday that..

1605
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,760
..there is no water in
my area for last three days.

1606
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:48,400
You cannot do such a small work.

1607
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,280
Mr. D let me remind you
that I am not in municipality.

1608
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,760
Not that I have remembered
then let me get it done.

1609
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:56,440
Call up Gaitonde.

1610
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,920
I will just show you
what municipality is.

1611
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:05,640
Hello..
- Gaitonde...

1612
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:06,480
Greetings, brother.

1613
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:07,840
How are you?
- Absolutely fine.

1614
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:08,680
Greetings.

1615
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,800
All that is fine. Listen to me.

1616
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,920
There is no water
in Dongri for three days.

1617
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:18,480
Send tanker there quickly
and I will not call again.

1618
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:23,000
Yes brother Arnab, tell me.

1619
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:26,000
Mr. D you have still
not answered my question.

1620
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:29,120
Tell me about your
journey from...to here.

1621
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:33,360
Look Dongri brought me up,
waiting room helped me to grow

1622
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,760
Wadala and Manish Market made me Don.

1623
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:38,080
Your government made me fugitive.

1624
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,840
That is all about my journey.

1625
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:45,000
And how did you reach this place?

1626
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,320
Here I have come with my wish.
Ask why?

1627
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:48,320
Why?

1628
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:51,800
I Karachi I feel the fragrance of....

1629
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:54,520
Okay now that e are
talking of fragrance then..

1630
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:57,440
..do you want to say
something about 93 blasts.

1631
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:00,840
Don't go there otherwise
interview will become like that.

1632
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:03,040
Mr. D it is my job to go there.

1633
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,760
I am also a service provider like you.

1634
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:06,840
I deliver truth.

1635
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:10,280
Then go and find truth somewhere else.
There is no truth about this here.

1636
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:11,520
So you do not want to say anything.

1637
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,920
How did the battery
of the remote decreased?

1638
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:19,560
Brother Arnab,
in childhood my mother had explained..

1639
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:22,080
..that if someone has
made up his mind then..

1640
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:25,400
..don't waste time
to make him understand.

1641
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,480
Okay so if you won't
tell then let me ask.

1642
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,680
Were you involved in 93 blasts?
- No.

1643
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:34,640
Not a plain no.

1644
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,640
I was not involved so
you want me to give a speech..

1645
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,600
..of three and a half minutes on it.

1646
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:39,680
What rubbish is this?

1647
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:44,080
It is very clear from the evidences
that you had supplied bombs.

1648
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,640
Yes I did.
When did I say that I didn't?

1649
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,800
But you just said that
you were not involved.

1650
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:50,440
Brother..

1651
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,080
I supply the bombs
and crackers that burst.

1652
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:58,480
I have a fireworks factory in....

1653
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:02,800
So you are actually saying that
you own a fireworks factory in India.

1654
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:03,720
Yes.

1655
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:06,440
If you don't mind can you
tell me the name of that company?

1656
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,040
You are again getting into details.

1657
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:11,360
What did you say that
is was what of drugs?

1658
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,080
Dominoes....
- Dominoes.

1659
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:17,800
So understand that I am
big bazaar of bombs as well.

1660
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:22,760
Let us talk about your
occupational hazards.

1661
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:27,920
I mean let's talk about the problems
you face in running your business.

1662
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:30,760
You must be facing problems
in running the business of bombs.

1663
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,200
Yes, from problem I remember.

1664
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:36,440
Yesterday Al-Qaida people
called and said that..

1665
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:39,280
..they had sent a suicide
bomb girl in Delhi.

1666
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:41,720
She was passing through petrol pump..

1667
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:44,320
..and four boys noticed
and thought she was their right.

1668
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,200
And did....

1669
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:50,400
Has it been declared
as official sport in Delhi?

1670
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:54,800
Can you elaborate that
suicide bomber matter?

1671
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,360
Don't deviate from the issue.

1672
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:03,560
The point is that in your country
a kind girl cannot work peacefully.

1673
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:05,440
I agree....

1674
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:11,560
But that so called innocent girl
had not gone there to do candle march.

1675
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,720
Leave it. Let's just move on.

1676
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:18,160
What other problems do you have?
- Attrition.

1677
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:20,080
Great. He did not
understand unresolved..

1678
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:22,480
..father issues but
knows of attrition.

1679
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:25,320
Did you say anything?
- No nothing.

1680
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:26,320
You carry on.

1681
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:29,920
In last two months two hundred
people have stopped working for me.

1682
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,640
Amazing. I had heard no
one can leave the job of Don.

1683
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,720
You heard it right but your Baba..

1684
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:40,600
..he keeps doing this.

1685
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:42,640
I had sent to threaten him.

1686
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:47,240
Three days they stayed in his camp and
said that they don't want to return.

1687
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:50,600
Seeing them some people
left from there as well.

1688
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:53,080
What SMS had come, Girdhari?

1689
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:54,480
Show them.

1690
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:56,560
Brother, we will not be able to do it.

1691
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:59,000
Such SMS are coming.

1692
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:00,000
What should we do?

1693
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,280
Absolutely bomb.

1694
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,080
Where?

1695
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:12,040
Brother, what is her name?

1696
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:13,800
Absolutely Bomb.

1697
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:23,280
Where have you got lost?
Ask further, reporter.

1698
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:25,200
Not reporter but senior editor.

1699
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:26,600
What is the difference between both?

1700
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,920
The same that is there
between gangster and Don.

1701
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:33,000
On this note let's take a short break.

1702
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:36,640
I am still sitting with
the most wanted man on the planet.

1703
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:41,280
And believe me things are going to get
lot more interesting. Don't go away.

1704
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,280
Bring water for brother.

1705
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,840
I will just check it.

1706
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:49,600
I was saying....
- Water...

1707
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:53,600
I was giving it to her.

1708
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:55,000
So, I was saying...

1709
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:56,760
Strange man you are.

1710
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:59,840
Okay drink.

1711
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,240
Thank you.

1712
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:10,920
What happened?

1713
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:15,160
These rich people are so stingy.

1714
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:18,280
After begging for two hours we
got this and that also without sugar.

1715
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:20,160
What are you talking?
Is there no sugar in this?

1716
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,760
What should we do now?

1717
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:25,160
I have an idea.
- What?

1718
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:26,840
Wait, let me think.

1719
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:28,600
Idea and that also you have to think.

1720
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:34,800
Bomb, bond....

1721
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:37,080
Brother, let me tell you one thing.

1722
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:40,600
Since long this idea
was coming to my mind.

1723
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:42,120
But just could not speak.

1724
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:44,920
It is the effect of the company.

1725
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,440
What has she given?

1726
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:53,480
After Duryodhan only
you have dared to insult.

1727
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,000
What do you mean?

1728
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:59,480
It means to insult someone physically.

1729
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:02,040
Is there any other
way to make someone naked?

1730
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:04,360
Yes brother.
Which one?

1731
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:05,560
Emotionally.

1732
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:20,040
Hi.

1733
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:23,760
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1734
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:26,000
You seem to belong to this place.

1735
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:30,640
What do you mean?
I was born in Faislabad.

1736
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:35,840
Okay. Don't you feel
guilty in working with D?

1737
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:43,560
I mean in whatever you are
saying is not with conviction.

1738
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:45,080
What is that?

1739
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:51,000
You are not saying with true
heart whatever you want to say.

1740
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:55,080
I am unmarried so do
not know the matter of heart.

1741
01:32:55,720 --> 01:33:00,360
If I was Gafur instead of Girdhari
then would you ask this question?

1742
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:01,440
About guilt.

1743
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:06,400
Do you want number?

1744
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:09,120
No, there is a call for me.
Excuse me.

1745
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:11,720
Yes sir.

1746
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,720
Come on Arnab,
he is killing you out there.

1747
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,480
Have you gone there to
ask questions or give answers?

1748
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:20,280
Just kick him in the guts man.

1749
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Do you know what the
reaction of the public is?

1750
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:27,400
You are trending globally
with a hash tag national hero.

1751
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:29,240
Do you know what that means?

1752
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,160
He is smarter than
what we had thought of.

1753
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:35,120
But don't worry it
is just the interval.

1754
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:37,720
I will take care. Okay.

1755
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:43,200
I think we are missing
an opportunity here.

1756
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:46,920
We are interviewing the
biggest interview of the century.

1757
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:51,560
Do you understand? This is Arnab v/s D

1758
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:56,200
Alright then 3, 2, 1 going live.

1759
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:59,000
Welcome back to the most
exciting part of the interview.

1760
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:00,120
The rapid fire.

1761
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:03,720
Yes, this is my favorite.
- Not this one sir.

1762
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:07,480
Okay, the one in which you
ask questions one after the other.

1763
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:10,440
And the one who gives answers
just say anything in haste.

1764
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:13,120
Is it that?
- Yes exactly.

1765
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:14,120
So shall we move ahead?

1766
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:16,040
You go ahead. I will speak from here.

1767
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:20,680
In this round I will ask
you five questions in 1 minute.

1768
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:22,680
You have to answer them quickly.

1769
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:23,640
1st question.

1770
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:28,040
If you are left alone
on an island for one week..

1771
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:29,920
..then whom would you
like to take with you?

1772
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Anyone would do.

1773
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:32,280
What do you mean that anyone would do?

1774
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:35,320
Because whosoever will come with me
but only I will be alive after one week.

1775
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:39,280
If you get a chance
to meet American president..

1776
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:42,680
..Pakistan PM and Indian
PM then who would you like to meet.

1777
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,440
I do not like the Indian one.

1778
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:47,000
US one is scared of me.

1779
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,880
And as far as Pakistan PM is concerned
then he is almost here all the time.

1780
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,080
Wait for 10 minutes and
I shall make you meet him.

1781
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:55,120
Virat or Shahid?
- Whoever takes the money?

1782
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:57,640
AK 47 or AK 56

1783
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:02,160
Brain...most dangerous.

1784
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:04,040
Nazreena or Geetika.

1785
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:05,280
Both....

1786
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:08,680
Not both but you have to choose one.

1787
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:12,160
Both have come here.

1788
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:13,040
Okay.

1789
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:17,240
If there is biopic on D then
whom would you want to play your role?

1790
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:19,040
Shashi Kapoor.

1791
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:20,640
Mr. Shashi Kapoor. Why?

1792
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:24,120
Even I have bungalow,
car and money but..

1793
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:26,760
..mother is still with him till today.

1794
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:27,720
Okay.

1795
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:29,600
Black money or white money?

1796
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:34,600
I am not racist like you.
Black and white is same for me.

1797
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:36,160
Okay favorite song?

1798
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:45,520
""The heart still finds
those free days and nights....""

1799
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:55,120
""The heart still finds
those free days and nights....""

1800
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:56,880
""We kept on sitting...""

1801
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,560
You want me to dance now.....

1802
01:35:58,640 --> 01:35:59,480
Ask further.

1803
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:02,880
I thought audience would
like to hear you singing.

1804
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:07,120
Anyone can sing.
Nowadays even cricketers are singing.

1805
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:11,520
If you would like to change one thing
in your life then what would it be.

1806
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:15,040
Instead of Dongri I would
like to be born in Colaba.

1807
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:17,360
After that life would
automatically change.

1808
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:22,360
I have to say that you
have answered well and frank.

1809
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:24,680
Leave all this, where is the hamper?

1810
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:25,760
Which hamper?

1811
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:29,920
The hamper that you
give after the rapid fire.

1812
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:31,440
I did not talk about that.

1813
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:33,120
That is not my problem
if you did not talk.

1814
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:35,600
A hamper is always
given after rapid fire.

1815
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:36,400
Everyone knows it.

1816
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:37,600
Do you know or not?

1817
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:38,880
Where is it?

1818
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,080
Sir, we will get it delivered
to you once we reach India.

1819
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:48,160
Hurry up and ask further.
It is time for my prayers.

1820
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,440
So Mr. D this is our
live audience segment.

1821
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:53,600
In Mumbai studio a panel
of three people is sitting.

1822
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:55,240
They will directly
ask questions from you.

1823
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:58,680
First of all Rohit Shukla from JNU.

1824
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:01,400
Rohit, ask your question please.

1825
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,480
Mr. D your responses till now show..

1826
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,320
..that you do not
have illegal business..

1827
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:08,640
..and till now you have
never gone against law.

1828
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:10,440
Practically very hard to believe.

1829
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:13,680
Hey, when did I say this sir?

1830
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:16,640
No Mr D we can have
a re learn of the interview.

1831
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:19,240
We are asking you something
and you are answering differently.

1832
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:23,200
Instead of you if I play interview of
Chhota Bheem it would look the same.

1833
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:25,040
Really..
- Yes..

1834
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:26,320
Come on....

1835
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:30,920
I have broken countless laws.

1836
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,680
Now we are talking.
Tell us more please.

1837
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:34,600
From last 3 years I
have not paid service tax.

1838
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:37,400
So you mean you have not
broken bigger law than this.

1839
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:42,840
Brother, you had said that
it is a family show so be censored.

1840
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:45,520
Our next question is from Mr.
Vijay Chakraborty..

1841
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:49,720
..who is our special guest tonight
from external affairs ministry.

1842
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:54,040
Can you tell us Mr. D that which
country's citizenship do you have?

1843
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:57,440
Don't censor this.
I will take care of it.

1844
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:14,880
Take this.
This is the proof of my citizenship.

1845
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,640
Whatever you feel is
more controversial keep it.

1846
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,800
What the hell? What is this?

1847
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:24,480
These are passport of 192 countries.

1848
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:30,200
You want to say that you
are citizen of the entire world.

1849
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:32,480
No, 4 still remain.

1850
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:34,240
Girdhari, what happened
about those 4 countries?

1851
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,760
Brother, we have applied
for it so it will come in 4 days.

1852
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:39,240
He must have made it in tatkaal.

1853
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:42,040
He is the one who was
the owner of the gun shop.

1854
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:45,720
Our next question is from
Miss Neha who is our ace news writer.

1855
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:49,120
Hi Mr. D

1856
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:52,200
This question is from
your female audience.

1857
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,880
Why do you always keep
moustache and what is this..

1858
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,800
..fascination with the
same brand of sunglasses.

1859
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:01,320
Why do I keep moustache?

1860
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:04,520
I get a character.

1861
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,480
I cannot keep a tail so
that is why I keep moustaches.

1862
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:13,080
Without moustaches I feel
a man is standing naked on the road.

1863
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:17,440
As far as sunglasses are concerned.

1864
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:22,160
So all things related
to me are banned in the world.

1865
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:25,160
So my glasses would be Ray Ban.

1866
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:31,000
A big thanks to our
panel in Mumbai and to Neha.

1867
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:33,080
World reminds me that..

1868
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,840
..there is a rumor that you knew
in advance about the Osama killings.

1869
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:42,080
I knew it? My men killed him.

1870
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:45,400
Such a big joke doesn't
suit your moustaches.

1871
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,200
I am telling you the truth Mr. Arnab.

1872
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:50,360
For three months he had not
paid the EMI of protection money.

1873
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:51,520
So I had no option.

1874
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:54,520
What are you talking?
US did such a big cowat operation.

1875
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:55,840
A movie has been made on that.

1876
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:59,040
A movie has been made on Jurassic
Park as well but that is not true.

1877
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:03,880
So you are saying such a big
operation by US was a video game.

1878
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:04,760
Is that what you are saying?

1879
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:07,360
Brother, anyone may do the operation..

1880
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:10,680
..but what do you know which people
are behind the commando uniform.

1881
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:14,600
Wow! It is very hard to tell
whether it is fact or fiction.

1882
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:21,520
Even about 93 blasts no one
knows whether it is fact or fiction.

1883
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:25,400
On that note we take a short break.

1884
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:28,040
We will be back with our
final leg of the interview.

1885
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:41,280
Hello, is everything fine there?

1886
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:43,720
Everything is fine here.
But what are you doing?

1887
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:44,480
What happened?

1888
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:47,280
The problem is that
nothing has happened?

1889
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,600
I had married a man who
was court martial on live TV

1890
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,280
And not with a man who
would get scared of a hooligan.

1891
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,680
Otherwise what do you think a crime
reporter like me would marry you?

1892
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,600
Tell me what do you want to say?

1893
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Listen, it might
sound cheesy out to you

1894
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,520
But you definitely remember
our journalism oath, right.

1895
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:13,560
We will uphold the dignity of this
country and its media come what may.

1896
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:16,800
Yes, it is getting cheesy and sweet.

1897
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:19,520
Shut up, Arnab.
This is not a joke.

1898
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:24,080
You are on the verge
of becoming national hero.

1899
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:27,400
How many people get this chance?

1900
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:30,720
Social media is going dessert.

1901
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:32,480
Do you realize the gravity?

1902
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:35,920
He must be a hooligan of somewhere.
What do we have to do?

1903
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:39,520
Just remember that you are
the biggest hooligan of Indian media.

1904
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:43,120
This is not just an interview
anymore to save your job.

1905
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:47,240
This is that trial of D which has not
happened in court for last 22 years.

1906
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:50,120
And it does not matter
if it is a media trial.

1907
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:54,360
We cannot afford to lose this Arnab.

1908
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:58,160
And India cannot afford to lose this.
So don't worry about me.

1909
01:41:58,360 --> 01:41:59,360
I am fine.

1910
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:01,600
And as it is I have
done a text to police.

1911
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:06,440
So you just go out there
and grab him by his fucking balls.

1912
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:08,480
Bye.

1913
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:31,920
I had never thought that I
would smoke a cigarette with you ever.

1914
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:34,000
Have you tried a cigar?

1915
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:36,160
No.

1916
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:38,840
It hurts my throat.

1917
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:45,320
Do you know why I didn't
ask for interview's script..

1918
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:47,760
..before saying yes to the interview?

1919
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:52,440
Because I thought
you are a family man..

1920
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:57,840
..and would remain in your limits
because of fear of wife's death.

1921
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:59,640
I thought you would
remain in your limits.

1922
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:04,160
But I had forgotten that media
people never remain in their limits.

1923
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:09,760
Just relax.

1924
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:12,640
We both will together take
care of the interview further.

1925
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:14,360
But remain in your limits.

1926
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:21,160
Otherwise it is Don's interview
on live TV so anything can happen.

1927
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:23,360
What did you understand?

1928
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:27,800
-It is happening too much.
-Yes you are right.

1929
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:28,800
Okay fine.
- Okay.

1930
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:34,280
It is the last leg of the
interview so let's make it count.

1931
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:37,080
This is your revised
draft for the final segment.

1932
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:38,880
Just show him his place Arnab.

1933
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:47,520
Welcome back to One
on One with me Arnab Ghsoh.

1934
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:49,600
Now we have reached
our final segment..

1935
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:53,360
..where we will ask some
inconvenient questions to MR. D

1936
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,280
Are you ready?
- Yes.

1937
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:01,080
From your talks we can make out that
your influence is on the global level.

1938
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:05,240
So were you behind
the hijacking in Kandahar?

1939
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:07,880
It is a limit.

1940
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:09,440
Now you would say..

1941
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:12,040
..that I am responsible for the
Malaysian airlines that got missing.

1942
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:13,520
I won't say that but
a Gulf news report says so.

1943
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,600
I won't say that but
a Gulf news report says so.

1944
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:18,240
This report is right.

1945
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:20,280
So are you telling
me a fact or a fiction?

1946
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:23,120
I have said what I wanted to say
now understand whatever you want to.

1947
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:25,880
Mr. D let me be very
categorical in my question.

1948
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,840
So you are saying that you
are behind the disappearance..

1949
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:32,280
..of two Malaysian
planes including MH 370.

1950
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:35,920
There is no need to be hyper.
Relax, relax..

1951
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:37,720
Is there no need to get hyper?

1952
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:41,600
You are saying that
flight disappearance..

1953
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:44,280
..in Malaysia have
been engineered by you.

1954
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:46,320
And you are asking me to calm down.

1955
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:50,720
All this has been made by media,
my brother.

1956
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:53,440
Nothing of this kind had happened.
- Then what had happened?

1957
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:58,240
What happened was that I had to sit in
flight from Kuala Lampur to Karachi.

1958
01:44:58,440 --> 01:45:00,680
And those rascals made
e sit in Beijing flight.

1959
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:02,360
Tell me what my fault in this is.

1960
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:05,360
I had to reach hurriedly
for my nephew's wedding..

1961
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:07,520
..so we had to divert the flight.

1962
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:09,320
Look, she is standing behind you.

1963
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:13,400
Now you will say that passengers
of the flight are also here.

1964
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:20,360
So do you think I have so many
servants in my house from beginning?

1965
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:26,280
What about the second Malaysian plane?

1966
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:30,400
You are too much, Arnab.

1967
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:36,160
After the problem I faced am I
stupid to travel by that flight again.

1968
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:41,560
No wonders your name is also
there in the top 10 list of the FBI

1969
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:45,200
This is the problem.
- What is the problem?

1970
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:51,200
The problem is Arnab
that I used to be number 1.

1971
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:55,160
In last three years I
have come down to number 6.

1972
01:45:55,520 --> 01:46:00,360
Boys whom I have trained
are on top of the list.

1973
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:02,680
What times have come?

1974
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:04,520
You have become sentimental.

1975
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:06,800
No problem. Everyone's time comes.

1976
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:13,280
I think that censor
thing does not apply to you.

1977
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:16,600
It does apply Mr. D but
I also get sentimental sometimes.

1978
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:20,040
I am sure you must be having
plan to become number 1 again.

1979
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:21,640
Yes I have a plan.

1980
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:27,280
If I shoot you on live TV
then I can become number 1 overnight.

1981
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,440
You are again talking like a hooligan.

1982
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,920
There is a difference
between saying and doing Mr. D.

1983
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,120
My hero.

1984
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:37,640
Finally on popular
demand one last question.

1985
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:39,000
Popular demand.

1986
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:42,280
Will I have to dance?

1987
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:46,520
You can do if you wish
to but that is not the case.

1988
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:48,000
Okay.

1989
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:51,680
Viewers want to know that you..

1990
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:53,280
..have many fake accounts
on facebook and twitter.

1991
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:56,520
Often you are being bullied on that.
What do you have to say about that?

1992
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:57,720
Are you saying correct?

1993
01:46:58,040 --> 01:46:59,640
Of course.

1994
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:05,080
One account is exactly
on your name with status update..

1995
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:07,320
..check in, and share happening often.

1996
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:08,320
Show it to me.

1997
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:10,040
Show me which account is this?

1998
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:14,640
This one.
- Yes.

1999
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:22,000
What is the matter?
Why are you laughing at your own joke?

2000
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:23,280
This is my account.

2001
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:27,680
Girdhari takes care of it.

2002
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:30,000
Show Girdhari..

2003
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:32,320
Look, look..

2004
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:33,760
Look.

2005
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:38,200
I had gone to Malaysia and
had checked-in in that hotel. Look.

2006
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:42,920
Once I was getting a philosopher
kind of feeling like..

2007
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:47,760
..Danish type so I asked
him to put that status.

2008
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:50,160
Look, look..

2009
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,720
I had gone to PM's daughter's wedding
and I have put photograph of the deal.

2010
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:02,280
Look Girdhari the face of
facebook has become like Doordarshan.

2011
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:05,520
You had put these
on..what do you call it?

2012
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:07,160
Gram Panchayat.

2013
01:48:07,240 --> 01:48:09,760
Gram Panchayat.
- Instagram.

2014
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:11,280
Instagram.

2015
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:14,360
Don't do anything that
will lead to thrashing.

2016
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:16,320
One last question?

2017
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:20,280
Why did you escape from India?

2018
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:23,480
I did not escape.

2019
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:28,320
I was going to settle
in Dubai to expand my business.

2020
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:32,480
Unfortunately the blasts took place
and you all thought that I escaped.

2021
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,760
Then why did you leave
your people alone in India.

2022
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:39,320
Or you had planned
to settle abroad alone.

2023
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,320
That's okay. There is no problem.

2024
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:44,280
There are many people who
are not bothered about others.

2025
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:46,600
And go away from home for business.
That is fine.

2026
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:51,000
Arnab, this time I will
not show a trailer on mobile..

2027
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:53,400
..but will show live shooting.

2028
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:57,040
What trailer will you show me?
I will show you your status.

2029
01:48:57,120 --> 01:48:58,920
Hey, talk sensibly.

2030
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,120
Hey, you keep quiet.

2031
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:02,000
You do not have the status
to become constable in your country..

2032
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:03,640
..and here you are his right hand.

2033
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:05,160
Do you know what
you do with right hand?

2034
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:08,600
Quiet. - Girdhari, leave it. A it
is the bullets have become expensive.

2035
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:10,240
Why are you wasting it? Leave it.

2036
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:15,360
D I will tell you
what your problem is.

2037
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:18,760
You have kept 200 body
guards and security system..

2038
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:20,280
..because you are scared.

2039
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:23,000
Sitting under so much
of security in the house..

2040
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:25,120
..you are talking about courage.

2041
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:28,880
If you are such a big dynamic
Don then dare to come back.

2042
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:32,560
Delhi is only 1100 kms away
from here but you cannot go there.

2043
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:35,280
You can go to Nairobi, Malaysia..

2044
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:38,800
..and even have passport
of the world with you.

2045
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:42,160
But will never come to Delhi.
Shall I tell you why?

2046
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:44,040
Because you belong to no one.

2047
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:47,680
You neither belong to your
family nor to your country men.

2048
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:52,520
The country in which you were born
you killed 257 people of that country.

2049
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:58,200
The area that brought you up is going
to police and court because of you.

2050
01:49:58,280 --> 01:50:00,600
But you think that you are Don.

2051
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:05,400
You are Bhai but your brother was
hanged six months ago in our country.

2052
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:06,360
Do you remember?

2053
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,400
You should have saved him.

2054
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:11,240
You are scared of
your own criminal record.

2055
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:15,680
You are so scared that for your
crime you let your brother get hanged.

2056
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:19,640
Take this.

2057
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,720
If I play this CD now..

2058
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:23,480
..then it will take
only 5 minutes to prove..

2059
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:25,600
..that all allegations
on you are true.

2060
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:29,520
You are fond of watching movies
so let's watch this CD together.

2061
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:34,160
You will not see because till today
you have been running from yourself.

2062
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:37,160
Don are those who accept
their crime openly.

2063
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:40,080
They either accept or deny openly.

2064
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:43,000
They do not hide behind random
fantasy stories just as you do.

2065
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:46,000
But what to do you are a coward.

2066
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:50,040
Now rest of your life you
will escape from these allegations..

2067
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:53,936
..and when you die then everyone
will run from burial place..

2068
01:50:54,016 --> 01:50:57,760
..because there will be no difference
between you and your crimes.

2069
01:50:58,040 --> 01:51:02,360
This is your luck D.
you are not Don but fraud.

2070
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Wow! Arnab.

2071
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:19,520
Brother...
- What have you done?

2072
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:24,040
I have not done anything.

2073
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:25,360
Give me the arms.

2074
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,440
You take care of brother.

2075
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:28,240
Girdhari, he has killed brother.

2076
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,080
I have to take revenge
for what he has done.

2077
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:31,000
Take care here.

2078
01:51:31,160 --> 01:51:33,360
Out, get out....

2079
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:43,360
Brother....

2080
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:46,000
Oh god, he has made me crazy.

2081
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:48,480
Brother's heart is very good.
- Come on..

2082
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:52,160
so he had to get heart attack.
- Come on, come on it is time to go.

2083
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:54,320
Brother's heart is very big.
- Okay..

2084
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:55,840
Bye...

2085
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,440
Come on....

2086
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:01,800
Brother....

2087
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:05,320
Hey, come on.

2088
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:07,160
Come..

2089
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:14,560
Do you know what the right hand does?

2090
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:17,560
The right hand shoots, presses
the trigger, slaps and takes revenge.

2091
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:19,480
Don't give me speech.
Finish it.

2092
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:21,040
Come on escape.
- Please.. please..

2093
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:22,880
500mts away you will find our men.

2094
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,760
They will help you
to reach your home safely.

2095
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:25,880
What are you saying?

2096
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:27,280
I am saying the truth.

2097
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:28,720
Come on.

2098
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:30,840
I am not believer in violence now.

2099
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:32,040
I believe in love.

2100
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:32,800
Are you joking?

2101
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:34,680
No, come on run....

2102
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:38,840
Hey, good bye Neha.

2103
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:41,720
Don't look behind and see.

2104
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:50,640
Bye..

2105
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:54,720
You are welcome in this
special edition of news.

2106
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:58,000
Harsh words took away D's life.

2107
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:02,240
Today's breaking news
is that our star reporter..

2108
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:07,320
..Arnab Ghosh has killed
dangerous Don D in his house.

2109
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:09,640
There has been turmoil in the country.

2110
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:17,880
You became a star overnight, baby.

2111
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:21,040
I was born as a super star.
- You are right.

2112
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:24,800
Okay, I wanted to tell you something.

2113
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:25,840
Tell me.

2114
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:30,000
You know this interview was
very tough and challenging for me.

2115
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:30,880
You know it.

2116
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:34,280
I had to accept many challenges.

2117
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,000
I know.

2118
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:38,200
I had to compromise.

2119
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:39,720
I know.
- You don't know.

2120
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,240
Are you telling me that
you have to compromise with D.

2121
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:47,560
No, no not that bad.

2122
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:49,560
Then anything else would do.

2123
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:50,800
I don't think so.

2124
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:52,200
What do you mean?

2125
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:58,000
Actually I will have to
sleep with Neha for one night.

2126
01:54:02,120 --> 01:54:04,760
What do you mean you have
to sleep for one night with Neha?

2127
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:06,040
Only one night.

2128
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,840
What rubbish is that?
- Only one.

2129
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:12,640
So you have guts to tell me this.

2130
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:13,840
Not to.

2131
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,600
You have a pregnant wife.

2132
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:21,800
You are a rascal.
You are such a creep.

2133
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,080
Say sorry.

2134
01:54:25,680 --> 01:54:26,680
Say sorry.

2135
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:27,800
Sorry.

2136
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:29,000
One more time.

2137
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:30,920
Only one.

2138
01:54:31,120 --> 01:54:32,360
Sorry.

2139
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:34,400
Only one time.

2140
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:36,560
Say sorry.

2141
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:39,280
Sorry.

2142
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:41,600
You area such a creep.

2143
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:44,640
Okay, okay I am going to the doctor.

2144
01:54:45,480 --> 01:54:46,440
That's it.

2145
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:50,120
And listen celebration is due tonight.

2146
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:53,800
If you are with me.
- Not bad.

2147
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,680
Among so much crowd....

2148
01:54:57,120 --> 01:55:02,880
The biggest.. is being
offered to the country.

2149
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:04,280
Hello.

2150
01:55:04,360 --> 01:55:07,640
Shall I call you brother
Arnab or senior editor Mr. Arnab.

2151
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:09,920
Hello.

2152
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:13,080
I am saying greetings Mr. Arnab.

2153
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:17,120
D.

2154
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:20,560
To hell with D.

2155
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:26,040
You are talking to
David Adrees Kalemen.

2156
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:30,920
The time has come to do that thing
which we have been planning to do.

2157
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:33,320
Brother, as you say.

2158
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:37,160
I will do acting of
heart attack and fall.

2159
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:38,280
Okay.

2160
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:43,760
And you make them
reach India safely. Okay.

2161
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:48,400
So that they can make the
news of my death as breaking news.

2162
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:49,560
Okay brother.

2163
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:51,880
And you will be free from this life.

2164
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:57,760
Yes Girdhari.
I wanted to kill him on live TV

2165
01:55:58,280 --> 01:56:02,720
Then I thought there
is an opportunity and..

2166
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:05,680
..why should I waste it
by committing a murder.

2167
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:09,000
Or give birth to a new life for me.

2168
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:10,800
Did you understand?

2169
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:16,280
You did not even know and you
became a chess piece of D's chess.

2170
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:25,320
Today I am going to
step into my new life.

2171
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:27,120
It is because of your favor.

2172
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:34,280
Do remember me if you want
a promotion or money?

2173
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:35,800
I will not refuse you.

2174
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:42,080
What are you doing?

2175
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:44,400
Have you taken the shock to heart?

2176
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:50,680
Sorry buddy.
I am trying not to laugh but...

2177
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:57,160
Whom are you calling buddy?
Do you know whom are you talking to?

2178
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:01,440
With David Adrees Kalemen.

2179
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:10,600
Buddy, I have seen many amazing
and foolish people in my media career.

2180
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:16,000
But you are too great.
You are above all.

2181
01:57:19,160 --> 01:57:21,600
Do you know what have you done today?

2182
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:25,320
With your cunningness
you have done something..

2183
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:28,840
..which international police
and intelligence could not do.

2184
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:33,520
You killed D with your own hands today.

2185
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:38,720
You think yourself to be a remote
control but you are actually..

2186
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:43,040
..a useless remote control of a TV
which is also there in my house.

2187
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,200
Your story is amazing.

2188
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:52,240
You were born in India and
then you went to Dubai.

2189
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:55,080
Then because of fear of Interpol
you escaped to Pakistan.

2190
01:57:55,160 --> 01:57:57,600
Then you got so scared
that you disappeared..

2191
01:57:57,680 --> 01:58:00,440
..not only from Pakistan
but from world map.

2192
01:58:01,720 --> 01:58:03,400
Great.

2193
01:58:03,640 --> 01:58:08,440
I have to say that everyone
is in love with his own identity..

2194
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:12,520
..but you destroyed your identity.

2195
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:14,240
Superb, buddy.

2196
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:18,400
Honestly I am grateful to you.

2197
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:21,760
You freed my country
from your hangover.

2198
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:23,000
Total free.

2199
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:27,640
Because of our police and intelligence
your fear had already disappeared.

2200
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:32,440
But you finished the fear
of your name as well.

2201
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:36,640
Superb. D, D is gone.

2202
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:40,000
Look what amazing thing I did.

2203
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:44,160
I am sure you must be standing in the..

2204
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:47,520
..ticket line of an amusement
park wearing red hat.

2205
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:51,920
But my stomach is twisting
because of laughter.

2206
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:57,560
Now I will take your leave.
I will keep the phone.

2207
01:58:57,640 --> 01:58:59,920
Okay. But one minute.

2208
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:02,760
Do you know what date is today?
15th August.

2209
01:59:02,840 --> 01:59:07,560
No one must have thought that today you
will free us from yourself.

2210
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:12,760
Now I have an important
meeting with real people.

2211
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:16,000
Thanks for calling.

2212
01:59:17,480 --> 01:59:20,320

Always keep change. Understood.

2215
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:34,560

2216
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:35,800

everyone think of themselves as D.

You have come from outside and you

maya luthra hai filed official
complaint against you

18

you have to give answer

19
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,872
I never needed to do this
nor I will need to do this

20
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:47,179
if this is fake then why maya will
do serious alligations against you?

21
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,756
Ofcourse he will say I'm lying

22
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:39,632

00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,819
if we dont do fun then it will
be a bad environment

35
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:32,944
I ignored it because we were friends

36
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,886
she is talking about trust

37
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,436
because of me she is in this
company

38
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,364
you are falling by yourself

39
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,674
my campaign was bad

40
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:28,211
your friends might like it but you
did not concentrate on product

41
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:39,194
because I dont work for you

42
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,356
she had willing to do

43
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,324
she only needed direction and focus

44
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:56,835
do you know where is rahul verma?

45
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,856

we were thinking its children tooth paste
then we should think childish

mother says son has grown up

64
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:10,783
its not like it was just a
sexual relation for rahul

65
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:18,396
they were shooting in shimla and
he reached maya's house

you have come to meet me or
want to introduce rahul?

67
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:54,363
He also likes me

00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:05,645
he is nice but he will not marry you

69
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:22,292

People will say because they
dont have to do anything

00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:06,085
you will call KK

81
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:45,025
because there is no future there

82
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,539
you stop thinking about my future

83
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:22,637
may be maya has filed case to take
revenge from rahul

84
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:18,619
you got alot of benefits because
of this relationship

85

if I had to used him then why
did I left?

86
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:57,126

88
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:41,675

95
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:34,896

103
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:06,543
1 day unexpected thing happened

104
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:18,950
may I know why?

105
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:23,890
They dont know how to work.
How much chances I give them?

106
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:32,268
You cannot fire people

107
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:48,316
ok I transfer them banglore.

108
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:23,189
You are fighting infront of everyone

109
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:29,476
may be we dont have time for
your campagne

110
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:20,179
by small mistake you will lose
big money

111
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:24,379
why you do everything alone?

112
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:53,706
You are angry

113
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,881
today I will understand

114
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:30,383
what are you doing here?

115
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:55,874
Whatever I heard about maya and
rahul is true?

116
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:45,858
If i was not here then even john
would not appoint you

117
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:06,610
she has also come here

118
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:24,664
there is lots of difference came
between you

119
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:36,267
before me rahul was doing this

120
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:54,820
everytime he has to go somewhere

121
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:18,175
suddenly rahul was disappeared

122
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:26,384
i could not wait and I went
to his cabin

123
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:41,075
office is closed

124
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:54,083
there is 1 thing,
you forget to pack condoms

125
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:06,797
I have a big meeting with their CEO

126
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:15,242
I'm going to my home, my friends are coming,
you also come there

127
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:28,146
you think what is more important

128
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:16,694
i thought you have gone

129
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:22,240
i have come here for work

130
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:52,071
tell them you are working on new
campaign

131
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:02,513
i told you, you are not ready for
this

132
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:12,950
your career that I made

133
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:46,193
what are you doing?

134
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:32,234
I lost that account

135
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:45,151
I introduced her

136
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:53,523
she even dont know how to speall channel.
Why she used that perfume when she came?

137
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:44,003
You know clients never go

138
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:53,516
what do you want?

139
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:32,584
Where is campaign?

140
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:43,762
If has files. If you think I will write
campaign then its not my job

141
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:17,963
why you called a female colleague
at your house?

142
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:34,621
We often got late at work
then we go to my house

143
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:07,821
if you were feeling this they why
you did not complaint about it?

144
01:17:15,697 --> 01:17:17,494
Thats our problem

145
01:18:11,086 --> 01:18:13,680
its all your mistake

146
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:22,246
you were also in that room

147
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:55,655
I just want to say I tried my best and
I did not know its just a beginning

148
01:20:56,718 --> 01:21:02,179
someone give you good shampoo

149
01:22:13,495 --> 01:22:16,623
you think house wives behaves like this?

150
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:48,024
Why you were staring at me?

151
01:22:55,737 --> 01:22:57,705
Why you are doing this?

152
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:43,708
I was working on presentation on so many days
and they give it so someone else

153
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,031
ok I will pick you up from airport

154
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:51,912
7 pm meeting is fixed

155
01:25:21,249 --> 01:25:23,774
because one of my meeting
is rescheduled

156
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:47,600
what he is doing here?

157
01:26:49,437 --> 01:26:58,345
Case is getting complicate so we
thought to discuss face to face

158
01:27:35,383 --> 01:27:39,786
they are so many cars which
are cheaper and better

159
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:48,392
cars can work on 1 thing,
that is celebrity endorsement

160
01:28:43,718 --> 01:28:48,382
yes I was angry but why I was angry she
did not tell you

161
01:29:00,401 --> 01:29:04,030
I reached there

162
01:29:10,945 --> 01:29:14,346
show me your campagne

163
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:27,127
I have to make this car number 1,
how you will make it?

164
01:29:28,162 --> 01:29:32,895
This car dont have a single feature which
our consumer will like

165
01:29:47,482 --> 01:29:50,474
may be we can sell this car but
this wont happen

166
01:30:02,764 --> 01:30:05,426
why you did not tell this?

167
01:30:10,671 --> 01:30:13,367
Yes he said this on airport

168
01:30:29,557 --> 01:30:33,323
that you did with me in the room

169
01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:43,022
bollywood celebrity idea was mine

170
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:47,362
how did you present it
without my permission?

171
01:31:53,207 --> 01:31:55,801
You have forgotten I'm CEO of
this company

172
01:32:32,113 --> 01:32:34,513
sometimes its good to be bad

173
01:32:42,990 --> 01:32:47,518
did i tell you to change rules
of relationship?

174
01:33:07,949 --> 01:33:10,247
So what do you want to say?
If i sleep with you then everything will be fine

175
01:33:19,393 --> 01:33:21,725
did you say this?

176
01:33:43,818 --> 01:33:46,446
You did not do anything like this

177
01:34:10,111 --> 01:34:12,671
if i sleep with you then everything will be fine

178
01:34:45,913 --> 01:34:48,507
you did not misbehave me?

179
01:35:22,083 --> 01:35:23,846
I came to kill you?

180
01:36:05,192 --> 01:36:06,887
What did you say?

181
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:13,131
Do you know how much I worked hard?

182
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:35,722
I leave this because one guy
has a problem from my success

183
01:37:05,553 --> 01:37:07,783
you will withdraw this case

184
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:46,617
what you were saying? Only 3 women are
national creative director in india?

185
01:37:49,396 --> 01:37:55,096
I'm going to files sexual harrassment
complaint against your CEO

186
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:02,398
rahul will not leave her

187
01:40:04,131 --> 01:40:06,793
you have asked so many questions
to me

188
01:40:08,469 --> 01:40:11,495
when we were having affair
did she complaint?

189
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:15,267
When she was getting promotions
did she complaint?

190
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:47,132
If i got into this case then
i will lose my job

191
01:40:58,886 --> 01:41:01,582
i cannot tolerate more insult

192
01:42:46,994 --> 01:42:49,963
you go to bangkok and take
some massage

193
01:43:46,186 --> 01:43:49,212
we will talk about it later

194
01:44:09,176 --> 01:44:14,443
maya's blame are wrong

195
01:44:16,450 --> 01:44:18,179
rahul cannot do this

196
01:45:00,227 --> 01:45:02,593
they both are right at their places

197
01:45:07,634 --> 01:45:13,266
I'm confused.
I cannot decide

198
01:45:54,514 --> 01:46:01,682
you can do court case or they will
compensate you to take back case

199
01:46:31,418 --> 01:46:33,147
she will not getjob

200
01:49:27,394 --> 01:49:30,261
how you are feeling now?

201
01:49:41,041 --> 01:49:43,305
Do you know what they will
do with you?

202
01:50:07,767 --> 01:50:09,428
You want to win?

203
01:50:09,903 --> 01:50:12,098
You cannot fire people

204
01:50:28,788 --> 01:50:33,748
I met with a person who can
do anything with you all

205
01:50:41,001 --> 01:50:44,698
teacher punished me to write 1000 times
on board i will not do this again

206
01:50:55,382 --> 01:50:57,680
then i left it

207
01:51:11,931 --> 01:51:17,301
i asked myself I'm doing wrong?

208
01:51:46,866 --> 01:51:49,460
You all know it

209
01:52:12,492 --> 01:52:14,619
you must be happy

210
01:53:01,141 --> 01:53:04,975
i did everything to save my job

211
01:53:37,177 --> 01:53:40,271
so what you care?
What you did with john?

212
01:54:26,726 --> 01:54:29,593
He was talking about new york office

213
01:54:36,536 --> 01:54:41,132
you allowed them to use you

214
01:54:51,885 --> 01:54:54,945
if you care then you would not
allow me to go delhi

215
01:55:09,135 --> 01:55:11,399
i told you dont go to delhi

216
01:55:12,038 --> 01:55:16,134
you said there is no future there

217
01:55:35,094 --> 01:55:37,392
whatever you did was good?

218
01:56:02,221 --> 01:56:04,781
You came with john to
take my job?

219
01:56:10,430 --> 01:56:14,491
I was in new york,
we met there

220
01:56:18,404 --> 01:56:22,500
he came behind me

221
01:56:33,953 --> 01:56:35,614
i came back for you

222
01:56:43,062 --> 01:56:45,053
i thought you will be happy

223
01:56:51,304 --> 01:56:56,469
and you will start loving me

224
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:30,532
what you did with john?

225
01:57:44,290 --> 01:57:48,556
Is it anything possible between us?

226
01:58:05,845 --> 01:58:13,718
You better ask yourself

227
01:59:44,744 --> 01:59:48,180
this email is my resignation letter

228
01:59:52,018 --> 01:59:53,781
i tell you why I'm going?

229
01:59:58,724 --> 02:00:03,388
My father said it anyone proved you wrong
then always be with him

230
02:00:05,565 --> 02:00:08,693
then i must have to know how it happened?

231
02:00:28,554 --> 02:00:32,422
I'm leaving this agency by
making my dignity
"
tt3640942,Koyelaanchal,"1
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,929
The owners..

2
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,891
...didn't just control
these mine fields.. -Hurry up..

3
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,720
""but also the labors living here.

4
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,168
Even after 26 years of independence..

5
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,802
Unscientific mining..

6
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,324
...poor working
conditions of the labors..

7
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,449
...and extreme exploitation of labors..

8
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,731
..forced the government
to form the Coal Mine Act.

9
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,362
But on 1st May 1973 the
government centralized all mines..

10
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,282
..and took over them.

11
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,724
But the real owners..

12
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,329
..were not ready to
give up this black diamond..

13
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,845
...and lose their
authority over it. Coal..

14
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,042
So, in order to
maintain their authority.

15
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,530
..they discovered
new means to exercise it.

16
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,884
And thus came in
existence, India's most notorious mafia.

17
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,166
Coal Mafia.

18
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,963
There's just one mafia in this country.

19
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,164
And that's the Indian Government.

20
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,281
And we're the ones..

21
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,010
..who protect Koye
aancha
..

22
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,445
..from the government mafia.

23
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,610
Because I know this is Koyelaanchal.

24
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,609
If you walk with your eyes open..

25
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,404
..your eyes will be filled with coal.

26
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,881
Try closing your eyes
and you'll be covered in coal.

27
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,410
The government servants.

28
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,968
..need my permission to load the coal.

29
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,361
Load it up, rascals,
what are you all staring at?

30
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,927
Here's the delivery
order. Don't you get it?

31
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,851
Your government papers are no use to us.

32
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,726
Your DO comes from
my government, not yours.

33
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,081
Get that?

34
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,405
You simply pass a
delivery order from Delhi..

35
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,725
..and say ""Go take
coal from Koyelaanchalâ.

36
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,326
'This isn't social justice.'

37
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,041
'The poor and backward
people of KoyelaanchaL. '

38
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,328
Raise their voice
against this through me.'

39
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,847
Why can't I load my coal in my truck?

40
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,410
Who says you can't?

41
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,761
Go ahead.

42
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,325
Just pay manpower difference..

43
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,767
..of the poor and backward.

44
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,640
Lallan. -Yes.

45
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,326
Make a difference receipt for him. -Yes.

46
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,890
Don't look at me, I am not on duty.

47
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,488
I would like to talk
to the officer on duty.

48
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,688
This is the authority here, sir.

49
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,600
Would you like a word?

50
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,611
But remember.. his word is final.

51
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,931
Absolutely final.

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,446
'We protect government officers.. '

53
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,761
From inflation to Maoists.'

54
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,683
'That's why from the
officer at weighing depot.. '

55
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,560
To the guard at the
check post works only for me.'

56
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,126
Sir..

57
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,204
...I'll be really grateful
if you ready my papers soon.

58
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,205
If I can leave in daylight.

59
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,004
...I won't have to pass
through the barricades at night.

60
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,769
If everyone leaves in the day..

61
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,002
..then what about the
guards that patrol at night?

62
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,560
But I've completed
all the formalities here.

63
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,047
The boss will be the judge of that.

64
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,244
One needs to give
many things other than coal.

65
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,001
We've to answer to the masters, not you.

66
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,206
Come on, seal you truck and get going.

67
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,081
'The government often keeps.. '

68
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,249
Transferring officers here.. '

69
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,322
To liberate Koyelaanchal from me.'

70
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,047
'It doesn't even make me laugh now.'

71
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,961
Rajapur's getting a new Collector.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,241
Many have come and gone.

73
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,971
If you try to meet them""

74
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,203
""you'll have to wait all
day at the Collector's Office.

75
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,126
Just see, his name
will get published soon.

76
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,009
They say he's a big righteous.

77
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,730
He's received training abroad.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,411
That's right.

79
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,642
We've sc***d our own people enough.

80
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,487
Now we should get
to sc**w some foreigners.

81
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,050
'The world's running because.. '

82
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,208
People believe God exists.'

83
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,370
'Koye
aancha
's running because.. '

84
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,803
People know.. their Master's there.'

85
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,329
'Saryu Bhan Singh.'

86
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,883
Master looks restless.

87
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,325
Lord have mercy.

88
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,291
The Master's
getting a divine revelation.

89
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,246
You weren't there..

90
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,169
That was when Rajiv Gandhi was murdered.

91
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,242
That day the Master
was restless just like this.

92
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,003
Karua isn't in Rajapur.

93
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,361
That's the only reason.

94
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,484
The Master's all alone..

95
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,080
What is it, Sadhu?

96
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,284
Nothing.. l..

97
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,847
I was just telling
the guards to be more alert.

98
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,402
Why hasn't the manager arrived yet?

99
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,842
He'll be here soon.

100
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,090
I've sent the car to the station.

101
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,608
There was a time""

102
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,680
..when only the
Masters would travel in cars.

103
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,402
But now.. everyone
thinks he's the master.

104
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,642
Everyone.. except for the labor.

105
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,729
Tea, please.

106
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,211
I think the Manager's back. -I guess.

107
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,442
Mr. Manager.

108
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,048
It's been 35 years since
the Master became the government..

109
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,684
..and the manager became the collector.

110
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,487
But your mentality hasn't changed.

111
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,924
The officer's aren't
getting f***d, you all are.

112
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,645
The people of Koyelaanchal.

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,048
And all because of your mentality.

114
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,323
Understand. Manager!

115
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,201
Ghosh, there's no place
for such discussions at my shop.

116
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,646
If someone's blood boils up..

117
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,042
..how will I feed my family?

118
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,728
Think about the country.

119
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,244
Troubles are coming this way.

120
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,571
Clouds of destruction
are hovering over us all.

121
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,531
If you don't find your ground..

122
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,528
""You'll perish forever.

123
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,044
And even history will forget your story.

124
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,687
Get the ball.

125
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,686
Run! Run!

126
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,211
This is the beginning..

127
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,568
..of Suryu Bhan's end.

128
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,729
Wake up people of Koyelaanchal.

129
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,291
This is the time""

130
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,610
..to speak up to the Collector.

131
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,610
Back in Raniganj..

132
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,809
""the Opposition
have made a separate union..

133
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,569
""apart from the Masters.

134
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,410
We'll form one too.

135
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,210
That's how we'll bring revolution.

136
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,568
Long live Revolution!

Move back! Move back!

140
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,683
Hey you.. Move back!

141
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,565
Stand there quietly.

142
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,444
Come in when I call.

143
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,241
How many cases?

144
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,401
Not much.

145
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,445
I'll finish everything in 2 hours.

146
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,285
The rates have been revised.

147
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,169
Ghanshyam will give
you the details. Get it.

148
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,611
And no one argues.

149
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,370
It was revised just last month.

150
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,366
Who said that?

151

ambience of disturbance building up.

""I am a labor.""

180
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,527
Why did Ghosh have to pick up the mike?

181
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,523
I don't think we can
get into the manor alive.

182
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,766
What do we do?

183
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,250
Uncle, run. -Yes.

184

Hurry up, uncle. -Yes. Give me a hand.

185
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,727
Are you going to act
when he hurls a bomb at us?

186
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,691
This isn't your cup of tea.

187
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,726
Uncle!

188
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,571
Jha, get these bodies out of there.

189
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,126
Sir, we recovered these
two hand-made bombs and a gun.

190
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,323
But I heard that
they were on that tree..

191
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,091
..when the shots were fired.

192
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,687
Maybe, sir.

193
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,725
You can't trust these extremists, sir.

194
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,047
That means they were shot on that tree.

195
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,888
And they fell inside the manor, Jha.

196
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,361
Them.

197
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,209
They are Maoists, sir.

198
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,564
They get shot in
China, but die on our land.

199
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,006
In India.

200
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,685
This two feet
distance is irrelevant, sir.

201
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,930
They kill or get killed anywhere.

202
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,321
Master.

203
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,770

206

..when I can't show you my hospitality.

207
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,241
Well..

208
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,362
...I had few questions myself.

209
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,406
Unfortunately.

210
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,081
Anyway.

211
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,291
..some other time.

212
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,964
All your life you were like a relief.

213
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,445
But your death is a burden on me.

214
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,327
Friendship is more
dangerous than enmity.

215
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,481
Right, Sadhu.

216
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,044
Let's call Karua, master.

217
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,685
We've kept silent for a long time.

218
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,361
But the rascals have
a whiff of his absence.

219
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,731
A small bird.

220
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,331
One Scarecrow.

221
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,201
The rascal managed to
create a stir in Rajapur.

222
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,161
It's more important to put a leash..

223
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,090
..on Vidrohi of Raniganj.

224
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,282
He's stirred up this storm.

225
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,926
He's the one.

226
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,523
""Gentleman, Pandit and Yadav.""

227
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,610
""First I greet everyone.""

Bless you!

229
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:19,450
""Now turn your eyes and take a look.""

230
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,725
""Take a good look at my beauty.""

231
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,490
""How do I go.. ""

232
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,050

We'll have to take a small break.

poet's Ahmed Farhaz's sonnet.

""The storm of death
can fire up the lamp.""

287
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,163
""They have
confidence on their brutality.""

""The hands raised
for truth are stronger..""

291
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,083
""..than the hands raised to kill.""

292
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,728
""My executioner is probably not aware.""

293
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,171
""This heart can beat in
the hands of a killer as well.""

294
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,961
""A dear is caught in
the midst of cannibals.""

295
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,122
The program's over, boy.

296
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,928
Didn't you see your boss?

297

Hey, where do you think you are going?

301
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,606
Karua.

302
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,885
Saryu Bhan's most ferocious killer.

303
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,882
He's shown great honor
by sending you to kill me.

304
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,488
The labor's voice can
be suppressed but not killed.

305
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,525
By killing Vidrohi..

306
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,571
..your master cannot
suppress this revolution.

307
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,966
Vishnu, what is it?

308
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,731
Vishnu, be quiet.

309
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,644
Vishnu, I told you to be quiet.

310
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,126
Let go.

311
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,601
I'll be right back.

312
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,721
Vishnu..

313
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,161
You?

314
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,806
When did you return?

315
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,770
I didn't know you're coming.

316
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,689
The Toll Collection officer's inside.

317
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,886
Wait, I'll be right back.

318
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,961
I'll be right back.

319
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,005
Karua. Karua, wait.

320
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,840
No, dear. No.

321
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,640
Here.

322
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,885
Don't pay heed to him.

323
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,288
He's been wronged by God, just like you.

324
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,730
Hey, hello. How are you?

325
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,686
Great. So, what's the latest?

326
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,721
Latest?

327
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,405
You wouldn't want to hear it.

328
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,529
When are you leaving? -Saturday.

329
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,930
Saturday? Why not tomorrow?

330
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,169
Nimesh still has to be given two drops.

331
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,446
And mom's saying that.

332
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,005
...I should leave only
after completing the entire course.

333
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,280
Better. Better. Better.

334
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,723
Listen, is there a good hospital around.

335
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,485
The place is plagued with diseases.

336
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,125
So there's bound to be a hospital.

337
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,606
Nimesh is up, I'll call you later.

338
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,251
Fine, call me.

339
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,447
Bye.

340

He calls
yesterday's incident a big deal.

361

What will he call
what's going to happen tomorrow?

362

So what were you saying, Captain?

364
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,044
I was saying this is
Bhusan Santa

..and together executed this plans.

367
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,686
I had a doubt. it was Bhusan.

368
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,208
He's using our tricks on us.

369
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,408
He thinks he's a leader of the Dalits.

Son..

371

Only me.

378

00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,843
This isn't dictatorship.

411
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,410
This won't do.

412
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,051
This won't do.

413
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,370
We'll have to tell
them.. that we aren't alone.

414
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,565
Everyone's with us.

415
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,208
Many people are with us.

416
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:04,767
We can stand up to them.

417
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,691
'Lal Salaam' (Red Salute).

418
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,804
Nasru.. or everyone!

419
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,281
Massage.

420
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,808
Lord dwells in the heart.

421
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,483
Glory to Lord Ram!

422
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,205
Forgive me, Lord!

423
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,966
Forgive me.

A film by Bhudbhak Bhansali.

428

A very goodnight to all the ladies..

429
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,766
..and gentlemen all over the world.

430
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,242
Welcome to the funniest place on earth""

431
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,164
...called Jharia.

432
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,170
This is Boka Pahadi Village in the back.

433
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,763
You can see the
smoke coming from under..

434
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,687
..because whole
Jharia's been burning since 1914.

435
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,409
But.. people still live here.

436
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,648
That's why it is funny.

437
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:59,642
Please.. listen to
the modern music of Jharia.

438
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,926
This is called
'Khasi Music' (Cough Music).

439
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:17,490
Because everyone here
has Asthma and Lung disease.

440
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,450
..due to smoke and coal dust.

441
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,729
This beautiful girl's name is Kalpana.

442
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,801
I asked her 5 months ago.

443
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,489
I guess.. you want
to be Aishwarya Rai. -No.

444
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,245
I want to be Kalpana Chawla.

445
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,323
Wow! Bravo.

446
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,291
She wants to become Kalpana Chawla.

447
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,323
Lady. Space traveler.

448
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,847
But Kalpana Chawla died in space.

449
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,845
This Kalpana will get buried here.

450
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,686
Trust me.. here is her house.

451
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,004
When the earth cracks,
she will get buried under here.

452
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,164
Jharia is a very funny place.

453
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,683
It's keep her people grounded.

454
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,569
Here earth cracked suddenly.

455
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,251
Because people take coal from under..

456
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,243
..and don't fill the hollow gap.

457
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,323
They are happy with money.

458
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:31,411
Poor life of 4 lakh
poor people of Jharia.

459
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,764
Government want to shift
these people, but they say..

460
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,490
We're fine.

461
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,130
We're not in any danger.

462
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,601
The government only
wants to drive us away.

463
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,045
They want to drive us out""

464
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,090
..and take authority over this place.

465
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,161
We won't leave our lands.

466
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,048
This is just the trailer.

467

Remember.

472
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,362
It is a Budbhak Bhansali Presentation.

473
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,002
Who is Budbhak Bhansali?

474
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,726
That's me.

475
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,729
I was ruined trying to make..

476
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,322
...the Bhojpuri remake
of 'Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam.

477
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,248
Since then people gave me this name.

478
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,569
We're artists.

479
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,689
All we want is to get famous.

480
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,411
Doesn't matter by which name.

481
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,248
But this is a serious matter, so..

482
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,211
No one takes Biharis and
Jharkhandis seriously, sir.

movies, atrocities, life, death""

A politician has
presented this country like ajester.

486
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,451
I've invested money,
so I want to recover that.

487
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,324
And.. I've also put
in Tribal women dance..

488
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,890
..in few intervals.

489
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,006
They are dancing without a blouse..

..on a hot ground.

491
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,650
And that increased sales.

492

Why don't you spare some time, sir?

493
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,529
I want to show you the entire film.

494

No, no. No need for that.

495
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,204
I completely
understand what you want to convey.

496

lam working on the same issue.

497

Please spare some
time to watch the film.

Okay.. see you.

508

The girl.. Kalpana.

509

She was my daughter.

510

That's where my house was.

511
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,726
Imagine sir, it's so difficult.

512
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,725
..to stand there and laugh.

513

I am sorry.

Get me the file on Mine Filling Scams.

516
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,606
Yes, sir.

517
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,121
And fix a meeting with
Saryu Bhan Singh, right now.

518
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,281
Okay, sir.

519
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,451
Hello.

520
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,011
Come.

521
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,764
Let's talk in the open field.

522
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,245
This isn't the place
for the district Collector..

523
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,211
..and a former Ruler to meet.

524
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,085
Are you scared?

525
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,209
Your company's filled this mine.

526
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,809
You must have
sealed it with sand properly.

527
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,365
So why be scared?

528
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,323
Come sit in the car.

529
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,891
Fine, as you wish Saryu Bhan.

530
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,481
Karua.

531
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,724
Follow us in the officer's car.

532
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,283
You're new here.

533
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,806
You must want to know about me.

534
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,641
I've heard a lot about it.

535
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,924
After you mine coal from these mines..

536
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,281
..it's important to be filled properly.

537
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,521
It is. It's important.

538
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,529
And your company gets
all the contracts for filling.

539
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,211
Who can know
Koyelaanchal better than me?

540
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,926
Yes.

541
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,443
And that's why, when you
should be using 200 trucks of sand..

542
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,882
..you don't even use 100.

543
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,408
Do you realize how
hazardous this can be..

544
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,689
..for normal life and the environment?

545
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,005
You will understand.

546
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,085
You will understand gradually.

547
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,325
Towards the Weighing depot.

548
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:16,165
Saryu Bhan, you
should 210 trucks of sand..

549
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,562
...in mine no 34114.

550
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:25,842
And this truck 3222,
made 16 trips in 24 hours.

551
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,727
If you get sand from Ganga Ghat..

552
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,646
..this distance takes 2 hours.

553
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,484
And loading-unloading is separate.

554
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,651
There might be a
mistake in the accounts.

555
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,844
We'll sit down and rectify it.

556
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,805
You see.. the
educated people left this place.

557
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,403
Delhi, Mumbai.. America.

558
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,929
And those who are
here.. make mistakes. What to do?

559
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,805
Yes, Saryu Bhan.

560
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,969
This is why the
educated people don't stay here.

561
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,407
The mistake of violating the law.

562
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,162
This place is an ecological disaster.

563
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,447
A human disaster. Do you understand?

564
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,442
Where do you hail from?

565
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,121
What?

566
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,648
I mean.. hometown.

567
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,605
Samistipur.

568
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,645
Samistipur.

569
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,885
It feels really good..

570
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:37,409
..when I hear a
Bihari speak such good English.

571
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,284
I feel proud.

572
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,006
Master.

573
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,011
Master. I beg your forgiveness.

574
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,811
I made a grave mistake.

575
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,727
Master, I'll accept any punishment.

576
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,770
Just forgive me.

577
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,529
Everyone was high
for the last three days.

578
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,720
But after Ghosh died,
everyone's back to normal.

579
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,645
These labors..

580
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,284
They care about no one.

581
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,643
They understand just one language.

582
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,731
Violence.

583
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,686
Violence.

584
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,764
Forgive me.

585
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,130
Take a look.. it's before your eyes.

586
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,684
Now you decide who is responsible..

587
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,923
..for disrupting the law the order here.

588
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,800
I had lost my mind.

589
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,966
I did it on Nasru saying.

590
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,006
It's that same rascal..

591
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,171
..who wrote those
abusing words for Master that day.

592
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,728
Now that he's scared for his life..

593
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,724
..he's begging in front of Master.

594
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,170
How did he escape you?

595
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,290
Karua. -Karua, let go.

596
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,771
Karua.

597
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,440
Stop, Karua.

598
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,643
Stop, Karua.

599
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,566
Karua.

600
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,281
Get out of my sight. now.

601
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,011
Stupid!

602
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,041
Serves him right, sir.

603
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,324
The rascal was a big nuisance.

604
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,641
No..

605
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,201
""whatever""

606
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,722
..he shouldn't have
taken the law in his hands.

607
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,926
The son's blood is ought to boil..

608
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,721
..if his father's abused.

609
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,686
Just forget what you saw, Mr.Collector.

610
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,689
No will talk about this in Koyelaanchal.

611
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,123
This is my promise to you.

612
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,401
Feeling better.

613
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,920
Yeah, yeah, come.

614
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,161
Come, come, sit, sit, sit.

615
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,290
Anything bothering you, sweetheart?

616
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,241
No.

617
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,721
Actually, yes.

618
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,442
I shouldn't have called you two here.

619
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,081
Why?

620
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,971
Fear of love and
loathing in Eastern India.

621
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,766
It wasn't that.

622
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,644
This place is unbelievable.

623
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,886
A man was brutally
murdered before my eyes.

624
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,445
The government,
people, police just watched.

625
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,241
Neetu.

626
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:17,045
Neetu I don't know who I need to reform.

627
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,450
Where do I begin?

628
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,884
Who do I begin with?

629
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,928
And against whom?

630
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,127
And what price should I be ready to pay?

631
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,361
Are you scared? -Aren't you scared?

632
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:42,129
Once a woman returns
alive from the labor room..

633
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,931
..she forsakes all fear.

634
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,967
The fear and pain in the
labor room teaches you one thing.

635
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,288
If you want new hope in life..

636
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,451
""then you have to go through some pain.

637
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,251
Nimesh is awake.

638
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,084
Go. -I'll be right back. Move.

639
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,925
Coming, son.

640
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,645
Coming.

641
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,721
Your name in the Mine Filling case..

642
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:27,491
..and Karua in Bhusan's
murder case have been brought up.

643
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,281
So?

644
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,849
So.. I'll have to lodge an FIR.

645
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,521
So go ahead.

646
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,122
Until now there were 422.

647
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,765
Now there will be 423.

648
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,005
I'll have to show an arrest.

649
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,121
Who?

650
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,043
Are you dreaming?

651
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:57,240
The Collector was the
eye-witness in Karua's case.

652
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,970
Didn't your Collector
puke at the Weighing depot?

653
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,202
I guess.. if I make
him s**t in his pants..

654
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,725
...he'll know what Karua is.

655
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,247
Go on.

656
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,288
I'll handle this matter myself.

657
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,367
Bless you.

658
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,641
Karua..

659
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,681
Son.

660
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:52,730
Now.. listen carefully
to what I say and understand.

661
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,444
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I ran into Mishra.

662
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,568
And you got an
excuse to drink another peg.

663
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,325
Absolutely right.

664
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,131
I was in the mood
to be drunk today, and..

665
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,284
And? This is the last
time we come here for dinner.

666
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,370
The food's so tasteless.

667
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,849
I'll ready my kitchen tomorrow.

668
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,323
And you keep at least 2 hours for me.

669
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,011
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

670
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,044
I'll do the grocery shopping
myself tomorrow. -Ok. Shall we go?

671
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,247
Shall we go?

672
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,681
What's this?

673
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,087
The District
Collector's going to Drink and Drive.

674
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,368
Come here, I'll drive.

675
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,920
Superb! No problem.

676
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,729
New chauffeur.

677
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,404
Driver cum wife.

678
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,370
Excuse me, you
forgot to sign the logbook.

679
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,881
No, no, I'm coming.

680
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,883
I'll just go sign the logbook.

681
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,200
Give me a minute. -Okay.

682
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,401
Yes.

683
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,249
'You don't have to
kill him, just scare him.'

684
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,642
'He should see his death.'

685
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,884
No, no.

686
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,246
Nisheeth!

687
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,567
Nisheeth! Help.

688
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,641
Meetu.

689
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:27,601
'Be careful, son..
there's no room for mistake.'

690
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,165
Stop!

691
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,609
'If anything goes wrong,
it will add to my troubles.'

692
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,165
Stop! Stop! -He got away.

693
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,201
Car..

694
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,408
Stop"" -Stop the car.

695
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,001
Follow him.

696
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,806
Meetu.

697
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,441
Someone..

698
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,484
Someone call the ambulance.

699
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,721
Meetu.

700
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,924
Someone call the doctor.

701
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,890
Someone call the ambulance. Please.

702
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,601
Meetu.

703
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,971
Please call the doctor.

704
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,248
Call the doctor.

705
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,961
Greetings.

706
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,807
Karua, are you fine?

707
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,641
I am fine, master.

708
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,640
What happened, son?

709
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,925
Even after I explained you.

710
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,362
I did what you said.

711
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,369
I didn't tell you
to shoot the Collector.

712
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,646
I didn't shoot him.

713
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,563
But how did his wife
get so seriously injured?

714
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,051
It's her fault.

715
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:14,083
Karua, you don't know
what mess you've put me into.

716
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,481
Listen.

717
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,848
Now stay quietly in RaniGanj.

718
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,281
Yes, Master.

719
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:24,126
If anyone abuses me
or pees on my picture.

720
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,526
You won't do anything.

721
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,324
If I hear anything about you..

722
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,049
""then I won't forgive you.

723
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,401
Karua.

724
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,606
Karua.

725
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,885
What's that noise?

726
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,887
The Collector's child is in the car.

727
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,605
Collector's child?

728
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,406
Where are you?

729
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,566
In the jungle.

730
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,601
How old is the child?

731
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,166
I don't know.

732
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,687
Listen.. don't leave
the child there to die.

733
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:09,961
Yes, master.

734
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,487
I've heard that the Collector..

735
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,570
..was blessed with a child
after lot of effort and prayer.

736
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,731
Keep the child safe, get it.

737
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,921
Yes, master.

738
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,684
And throw your phone away.

739
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,081
Throw it right there.

740
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,403
I'll tell you what
next when the time comes.

741
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,601
Yes, Master.

742
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,288
Quiet!

743
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,361
Oh, God!

744
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,648
Don't kill me. It's me.

745
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,801
Shambhu.

746
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,405
Master has sent a message.

747
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,770
The child shouldn't die.

748
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,885
He's dead.

749
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,086
Dead?

750
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,482
Oh, God! I am dead.

751
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,043
Now I'll be blamed for it.

752
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:17,448
I delayed in
delivering the message and..

753
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,800
Oh, God!

754
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,201
Why?

755
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,807
I've made 20 trips to your home.

756
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,560
My stomach was murmuring.

757
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,489
I just went to the
fields to relieve myself"".

758
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,609
..and you messed things up.

759
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,207
What's my fault?
Tell me.. is it my fault?

760
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,371
Where is he?

761
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:41,840
He's alive.

762
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,925
Your prank has given me loose motions.

763
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,485
Look after him.

764
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,962
I'll tell the
master ""Message Delivered"".

765
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,921
lam going.. the
pressure's building up again.

766
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,889
Water"" it's there.

767
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,401
Hey""

768
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,081
Here..

769
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,361
Quiet!

770
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,529
""Shoot the brain.""

771
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,689
""It makes a racket.""

772
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:03,368
""Shoot the brain.""

01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,689
What's his name?

958
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,124
What's his name?

959
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:13,761
Uncle, what's his name?

960
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,730
She was asking, not me.

961
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,923
He says he hasn't named him yet.

962
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,571
Can I call him Shahrukh?

963
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,120
He's fair like Shahrukh.

964
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:35,651
I won't ask.

965
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,927
Go ask him sissy.

966
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,207
Uncle, can we call him Shahrukh Khan?

967
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,809
Can we call him Shahrukh Khan?

968
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:46,881
Uncle.

969
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,685
Not me.. it's her.

970
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,285
He says it's okay.

971
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,569
Eat it, my Shahrukh.

972
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,080
Shahrukh. Shahrukh.

973
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:06,969
Eat, Shahrukh.

974
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:44,727
Come home.. when the kid's asleep.

975
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,601
Karua.

976
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,569
Return him to whomever he belongs.

977
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,529
How many more
curses are you going to take?

978
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,409
He's made you commit sins..

979
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,009
..and poses as an austere himself.

980
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,086
The scoundrel of Rajapur.

981
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,929
Do you know the worth of each gun?

982
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,328
It's not more than my brother's life.

983
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,808
Brother's life or the right of the poor.

984
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,921
Your brother got
scared by a single blow..

985
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:22,367
..and went to plead for his life.

986
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:25,410
That was Bhusan, I am Puran.

987
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:27,960
We might look alike, but""

988
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:31,085
..you will gradually
understand the difference between us.

989
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,206
Bravo. Now you sound like a Comrade.

990
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:35,566
To hell with your Comrades.

991
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,728
This is about the poor.

992
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:43,564
And don't try to show
that you're doing a favor on me.

993
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,890
No one cares for the poor
without any selfish motives.

994
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,046
Not even God.

995
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,490
The thing is that.

996
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,162
..you stand to get gain from me..

997
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,488
""that's why you're spending on these.

998
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,042
But I have nothing to lose.

999
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,771
SO I will fight.

1000
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,166
Have you seen him?

1001
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,128
This man with a smiling face?

1002
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:31,886
No, mister.

1003
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,570
I swear I haven't.

1004
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:34,761
Okay.

1005
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,521
Naughty-

1006
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,089
'Come here.'

1007
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,286
'Come here.'

1008
01:23:37,961 --> 01:23:41,852
Shahkukh. Don't cry.

1009
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:44,566
Shahkukh. Don't cry.

1010
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,089
Shahkukh.

1011
01:23:48,201 --> 01:23:49,885
Want a toffee?

1012
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,121
Here.

1013
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:52,924
Shahrukh.

1014
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:55,242
Want a toffee?

1015
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,241
Shahrukh. -Hey. Leave.

1016
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,881
I brought a toffee for Shahrukh.

1017
01:24:01,001 --> 01:24:02,730
Shahrukh.

1018
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,844
Want a toffee?

1019
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,921
See.. he's saying he wants it.

1020
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:45,641
Shahrukh.

1021
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:48,401
Shahrukh.

1022
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,007
'Karua, the boy shouldn't die.'

1023
01:24:53,161 --> 01:24:54,322
'Get it.'

1024
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:00,761
What?

1025
01:25:00,841 --> 01:25:02,172
Let's go.

1026
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:04,681
Why?

1027
01:25:05,001 --> 01:25:06,810
The child.. -I won't go.

1028
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,281
Come with me. -Let go.

1029
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:11,762
Let me go. Let me go.

1030
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:14,241
Why do drag me into this?

1031
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,085
If you're so worried for him..

1032
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,844
..then return him to his mother.

1033
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,371
Otherwise go call the one..

1034
01:25:19,401 --> 01:25:21,324
..who made you commit this sin.

1035
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:22,686
Butchers.

1036
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,202
Hit me. -Hit me.

1037
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:34,321
I won't go.

1038
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,607
You've killed many people.

1039
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:37,961
Kill me too.

1040
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:39,161
Come on.

1041
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,407
Beat this wench to death.

1042
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:43,290
Come on. Hit me.

1043
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,488
Why don't you hit me? Hit me.

1044
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:10,681
Quiet!

1045
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:13,086
""The cloud of love.""

1046
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:17,964
""Knows no weather.""

1047
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:22,486
""The cloud of love.""

1048
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:29,331
""The cloud of love.""

1049
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,811
""Knows no weather.""

1050
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:38,201
""The heart.. ""

1051
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,642
Does as it wants.""

1052
01:27:43,721 --> 01:27:47,646
""The cloud of love.""

1053
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,562
There's Someone higher than your master.

1054
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:54,964
Do a good deed in His view.

1055
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:59,971
Who knows.. maybe it
will wash away your sins.

1056
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,201
Don't separate the
child from his mother..

1057
01:28:05,481 --> 01:28:07,848
...""The cloud of love.""

1058
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,771
""Knows no weather.""

1059
01:28:13,161 --> 01:28:17,610
""The heart.. ""

1060
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:22,249
Does as it wants.""

1061
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:27,287
""The cloud of love.""

1062
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:33,370
""Knows no weather.""

1063
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:43,283
""My heart does as it pleases.""

1064
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:48,730
""The cloud of love.""

1065
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:01,964
What were you saying?

1066
01:29:04,681 --> 01:29:06,092
Nothing.

1067
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,571
I was saying..

1068
01:29:07,881 --> 01:29:11,203
...please make my
daughter's birth certificate.

1069
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,404
I'll be grateful.

1070
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:15,528
What will be the father's name?

1071
01:29:17,481 --> 01:29:18,846
Put in your name.

1072
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,680
You've been coming
here before she was born.

1073
01:29:22,281 --> 01:29:23,612
What did you say?

1074
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:29,166
Nothing.. I was just joking.

1075
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,601
Know your limits.

1076
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:33,446
And here's your fee.

1077
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:37,605
Your job will be
done when the time comes.

1078
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,528
Hey, naughty.

1079
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:04,681
Say Papa-

1080
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:06,609
Say papa. -Say papa.

1081
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:09,371
Come here. Come here.

1082
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,687
Say Papa-

1083
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,569
Say Papa-

1084
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:15,006
Say Papa-

1085
01:30:15,081 --> 01:30:16,082
Say Papa-

1086
01:30:16,361 --> 01:30:18,284
You won't say it.

1087
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:19,805
Papa. Papa--

1088
01:30:20,201 --> 01:30:23,125
Say mama.

1089
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:24,726
Naughty-

1090
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:29,691
Ma.. -Ma.. Ma.. No.. !

1091
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,842
Come here..

1092
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:25,841
Yes.

1093
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:30,011
<i>Yes, wet.</i>

1094
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,321
Nisheeth here.

1095
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:36,531
I need to setup a meeting
as soon as possible, please.

1096
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:43,324
Let's all face the
facts and accept that..

1097
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:46,125
..we've been complete failures
when it comes to Saryu Bhan Singh.

1098
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,609
So far we've been
able to achieve nothing.

1099
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,328
Saryu Bhan Singh is above the law.

1100
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:55,367
We need to destroy this myth.

1101
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,011
40 years in this business.

1102
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:58,770
And not arrested even once.

1103
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:02,487
What else will people
think of him if not a don?

1104
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:03,641
A bloody criminal.

1105
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,085
A third grade bloody criminal.

1106
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:07,722
I studied every case of his inside-out.

1107
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:10,601
He's never involved directly.

1108
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,167
For example, take the mine-filing scam.

1109
01:32:13,481 --> 01:32:15,961
We can get a warrant
on Mahavir Earth Shakers.

1110
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:18,363
But according to the company documents.

1111
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,811
""the owner is Vinay Kanojia.

1112
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:21,886
His driver.

1113
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:25,040
We can arrest. but Vinay Kanojia.

1114
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,842
Same bloody problem in every damn case.

1115
01:32:31,081 --> 01:32:33,163
Even if we arrest him on this case..

1116
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:36,847
...he'll get bail within 24 hours.

1117
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:39,606
And then""

1118
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,604
The situation can get worse.

1119
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:43,841
Excuse me, sir.

1120
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:48,002
To discuss on how to restore""

1121
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:52,688
...law and order in a small city"".

1122
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,644
...the Inspector General of Police..

1123
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,049
...Director General of Police..

1124
01:32:57,961 --> 01:33:00,567
..District
Collector, District Magistrate..

1125
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:04,004
..
nte

igence are meeting secretly""

1126
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:08,130
..in the pool room of a club.

1127
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:15,250
How much worse can the situation get?

1128
01:33:17,801 --> 01:33:18,927
If you want honey..

1129
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,049
..you have to stick
your hand in the beehive.

1130
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,045
Just once, sir.

1131
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:28,250
Just once.

1132
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:32,127
We need to cuff that
rascal Saryu Bhan Singh..

1133
01:33:32,201 --> 01:33:36,889
..and trot him around entire Rajapur.

1134
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:44,680
I challenge.. everyone will speak up.

1135
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:46,809
But how will you do it?

1136
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:48,970
Wait till sunset.

1137
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:51,321
Let the court close.

1138
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:54,409
Tomorrow and the day after is a holiday.

1139
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,766
And then Sunday.

1140
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:59,610
In three days we've to
change Koye
aancha
's history.

1141
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:05,323
We'll dare.. and the
sacred Cows will help us.

1142
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:29,241
Careful.

1143
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:30,805
What's going on here?

1144
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:33,124
Sadhu, what's happening?

1145
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,689
They're testing our patience.

1146
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:42,643
Mr. Collector, what's your problem?

1147
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:47,888
I don't, but these
poor, helpless animals do.

1148
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:50,565
We're here to rescue them.

1149
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:51,687
What?

1150
01:34:53,920 --> 01:35:00,326
Did my cows lodge an FIR?

1151
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:04,366
No.

1152
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:07,686
A we're taking this action""

1153
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:09,964
...on a senior bureaucrat's complaint.

1154
01:35:11,721 --> 01:35:13,564
I guess you know Mr. lyer.

1155
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,290
Mr. lyer, come.

1156
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:17,006
Come.

1157
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:20,121
Senior bureaucrat, Mr. Kanan lyer.

1158
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:26,370
You've kept your
animals in a pathetic condition.

1159
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:30,361
So many animals in a small cowshed.

1160
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:34,327
No place to sit, stand or even breathe.

1161
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:38,921
See.. your animals are also hurt.

1162
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:42,044
And.. the feeding
arrangements are also bad.

1163
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,685
And you know..

1164
01:35:44,681 --> 01:35:47,764
We found this
medicine from your cowshed.

1165
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:51,370
This medicine is banned by the WHO.

1166
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:54,171
What new law are you trying to teach me?

1167
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:56,322
This law is called..

1168
01:35:57,360 --> 01:36:04,050
Prevention of Cruelty
Against Animal Act.. 1960.

1169
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:06,483
The one's you're calling animals..

1170
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:09,561
..are dear to me like my children.

1171
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:16,647
And then"" how long can
you keep them away from me?

1172
01:36:19,561 --> 01:36:21,609
It will take at least 3 days.

1173
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:23,646
But that's okay.

1174
01:36:23,721 --> 01:36:26,247
You can file an
affidavit in the court after that.

1175
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,564
You will have to
pay a fine of 2000-3000.

1176
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:32,566
After that. your
children will be free.. and you too.

1177
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:34,606
Me too?

1178
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,001
Meaning?

1179
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:39,402
It means we're arresting you under..

1180
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:43,650
""Prevention of Cruelty
Against Animal Act.. 1960.

1181
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:03,929

I'll erase you from
existence"" or my name isn't""

1183
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:09,527
You can name your pet after me.

1184
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:10,726
You don't know..

1185
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:12,882
""what a dire step you're taking.

1186
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,850
It will burn.. Rajapur will burn!

1187
01:39:43,721 --> 01:39:46,725
Why has Saryu Bhan been arrested?

1188
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:49,201
Would you like to
comment on your arrest?

1189
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:51,886
Do you think by arresting Saryu Bhan..

1190
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:53,570
..you can eradicate
crime from Koyelaanchal.

1191
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:56,490
Do you think there's a
political conspiracy behind your arrest.

1192
01:39:56,920 --> 01:39:59,366
Nobody could arrest Saryu
Bhan until now. -No comments please.

1193
01:39:59,401 --> 01:40:00,846
How did you succeed?

1194
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:04,085
Please help us.

1195
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:06,561
No comments. -ls it
a political conspiracy?

1196
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:11,123
The police and
administration are hesitating to comment.

1197
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:12,924
..on Saryu Bhan's arrest.

1198
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,526
People are calling Saryu Bhan's arrest.

1199
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:19,730
..the government's
action against the coal mafia.

1200
01:40:23,081 --> 01:40:26,324
Why are you telecasting wrong news?

1201
01:40:26,921 --> 01:40:28,332
Along with my master..

1202
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:30,926
""they have also arrested my cows.

1203
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,331
Cows? -Yes.

1204
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:36,769
Now tell me.. how are
the cows related to the mafia?

What"" do you think?

1209
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:49,209
Was Saryu Bhan Singh
arrested because of the cows?

1210
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,804
You wait here.

1211
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:04,688
Sadho, it's a minor case.
-We'll get bail from the station.

1212
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:06,290
Talk to the SP.

I'll talk to him
when he answers my phone.

1214
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:12,641
They must have kept him occupied.

1215
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:16,049
Listen. Tell sir Sadho's here.

1216
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:18,170

1219
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:22,811
He was on duty in the morning.

01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:24,166
He talked to me.

1221
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:26,051
He's the senior officer.

1222
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:28,640
No one knows when
he comes or what he does.

1223
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,131
Want some tobacco.

Lord..

1249
01:43:45,641 --> 01:43:50,090
No one should know
anything about the master.

1250
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:51,400
Absolutely no one.

1251
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:53,482
Especially Karua.

1252
01:43:53,641 --> 01:43:56,167
Karua. Leave everyone.

1253
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:58,209
Come on. -Go.

1254
01:43:58,240 --> 01:43:59,287
Run.

1255
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:01,446
What happened, brother?

1256
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:02,527
Hello, brother.

Did someone give you any news?

1259
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:07,605
I mean absurd.

1260
01:44:08,041 --> 01:44:09,566
You came on time.

1261
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:11,770
I was on my way to the mines.

1262
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:13,524
They'll be distributing salaries today.

1263
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:15,370
So.. it's important for me to be there.

1264
01:44:15,721 --> 01:44:17,883
These labors have
no rules, you know that.

1265
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:21,051
These labors. They are a big..

1266

Everyone's fine.

Come.

1271
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:47,209
I didn't expect you to stoop so low.

1272
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:51,571
Lower than kidnapping a baby.

1273
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:01,730
Give me your phone.

1274
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:04,962
Let me answer this call.

I don't want my people..

1276
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:10,883
..to get agitated without a reason.

1277
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:14,126
It's for your own good.

1278
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:22,800
Yes, Shambhu.

1279
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:24,326
Greetings.

1280
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:29,964
I told you not to call.

1281
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:33,724
Master, I want to see you.

1282
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:35,686
Not possible.

1283
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:37,966
What are my orders?

1284
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:39,681
Look after yourself.

1285
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:42,766
It's for your own and my good.

1286
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:49,480
Give me your phone.

1287
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:53,481
Thank you.

1288
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:06,087
Uncle, I gave Shahrukh a bath.

1289
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:08,322
Look at how handsome he's looking.

1290
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,402
Uncle, didn't you
teach him to wash his s**t.

1291
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:17,166
That's because he's still small.

1292
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:20,369
No, no, no..

1293
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,401
Here.. here..

1294
01:46:24,681 --> 01:46:26,968
Shahrukh.

1295
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:33,049
Uncle, where's his mother?

1296
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:35,686
Uncle.

1297
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,002
You don't speak at all.

1298
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:40,201
In the city.

1299
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:42,203
Even my father lives in the city.

1300
01:46:42,281 --> 01:46:44,170
Have you seen him?

1301
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:48,690
She's lying. Her father is dead.

1302
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:50,569
What are you whispering?

1303
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:52,970
I was asking should I teach""

1304
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:55,964
..Shahrukh the song we learnt in school?

1305
01:46:56,041 --> 01:46:57,884
Uncle says I can.

1306
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:01,044
Fish is the queen of the water.

1307
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:04,203
Water is her life.. -No,
no, he'll learn my father's poem.

1308
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:05,805
Right, Shahrukh Khan.

1309
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:09,842
My detractors never thought perhaps.

1310
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:14,520
That I am the lamp that
good survive the winds of death.

1311
01:47:14,601 --> 01:47:18,526
That I am the lamp that
good survive the winds of death.

1312
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:22,202
My father will get me a new frock today.

1313
01:47:22,281 --> 01:47:24,124
My father too.

1314
01:47:24,201 --> 01:47:27,091
Liar. I know he isn't coming.

1315
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:29,288
A goon killed him.

1316
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:34,611
Your master cannot suppress
this revolution by killing rebels.

1317
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:37,164
Be quiet, my father will come.

1318
01:47:37,321 --> 01:47:41,121
Liar. I know he isn't
coming. A goon killed him.

1319
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:43,282
Your father will forget
everything after he's drunk.

1320
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:44,805
And he won't get you anything.

1321
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,405
My father doesn't forget.

1322
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:50,007
Workers' voice can be
suppressed, but can't be killed.

1323
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:58,649
Your Master can't suppress
revolution by killing the rebels.

1324
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:02,043
Your father's a wretch. He
won't get you anything you b****.

1325
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:05,610
She's a liar.

1326
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:08,524
My father will bring a frock.

1327
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:13,521
Uncle, tell my father to get my frock.

1328
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:15,364
His name is..

1329
01:48:15,401 --> 01:48:16,846
Mayku Bhuiyaan.

1330
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:20,089
Write 200 Rs against my name. -200?

1331
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:22,088
Pay 500. -500?

1332
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:25,284
Do you have a problem?

1333
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:29,605
I'm paying. Here's
500. Give me a receipt.

1334
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:15,161
Jai Hind, sir. -Jai Hind.
-Good morning, sir. -Good morning.

1335
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:16,531
Morning.

1336
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:18,964
Good morning, sir. -Good morning.

1337
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:23,201
Morning, lyer. -Morning, Nisheeth.

1338
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:26,890
Your love-letter has arrived.

1339
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:30,689
I guess mine's on the way.

1340
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:34,127
These are Saryu
Bhan's bail papers, right?

1341
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:35,201
Yes, sir.

1342
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:36,486
Okay.

1343
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:39,003
Hey, Nisheeth, good to see you buddy.

1344
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:40,970
I was waiting for you.

1345
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:45,841
Sorry.

1346
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:47,524
I started using your office..

1347
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,649
""without completing the formalities.

1348
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:53,249
I hope you
understand"" and you won't mind it.

1349
01:49:54,921 --> 01:49:57,492
Hey.. which formality?

1350
01:49:57,680 --> 01:49:59,011
What formality?

1351
01:49:59,081 --> 01:50:02,767
The orders has
arrived.. that you're the Collector.

1352
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:04,485
Then that's final.

1353
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:06,324
Hold on, Sadho sir. Hold on.

1354
01:50:06,680 --> 01:50:09,524
Nisheeth, I just got
these orders few hours back..

1355
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:12,365
..to take charge immediately.

1356
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:13,765
And.. your..

1357
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:15,365
Your..

1358
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:18,251
This is your transfer orders.

1359
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:20,883
I was asked to hand it over personally.

1360
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:23,243
You know how these
things happen sometimes.

1361
01:50:23,721 --> 01:50:24,722
No.

1362
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:28,409
No, Sharma, I don't
understand why these things happen.

1363
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:33,763
I don't understand
why these happen sometimes.

1364
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:37,004
But with an honest officer..

1365
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:39,323
""this happens all the time.

1366
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:42,410
Always"" some Khemka
is transferred 40 times..

1367
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:44,323
...in his 20 year career.

1368
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:47,286
Some Durgashakti gets suspended..

1369
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:49,210
""without prior notice.

1370
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:50,726
Why?

1371
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:55,043
The Supreme Court keeps coaxing you..

1372
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:57,202
..to bring the Civil
Services act but you don't listen.

1373
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:59,562
They tell you to fix a
minimum tenure for officers..

1374
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:01,170
""but you don't listen. Why?

1375
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:04,130
Because you want to
blindly follow orders.

1376
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:07,887
If you want to bully
us around, do it openly.

1377
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:12,200
Why do you put our honor,
dedication and life at stake?

1378
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:15,802
I was clearly given in writing""

1379
01:51:15,881 --> 01:51:18,407
..to go in that
region and create a normalcy.

1380
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:20,809
Deal with nuisance elements.

1381
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,888
And eliminate if required.

1382
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:27,770
So that's what I am doing.

1383
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:30,402
Then why suddenly am I a nuisance?

1384
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:35,371
I am sorry, Sharma, I do not understand.

1385
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:39,646
And now I do not
want to understand period.

1386
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,566
See..

1387
01:51:44,681 --> 01:51:46,888
..he's getting so restless.

1388
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:49,403
It's because he tightened our grip.

1389
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:54,203
He dared to touch my master.

1390
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:57,201
I'll kill him in..

1391
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:59,328
Please. Please, Sadho. Please.

1392
01:51:59,401 --> 01:52:01,847
Nisheeth, don't make it personal.

1393
01:52:01,961 --> 01:52:03,451
What rubbish, Sharma.

1394
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:06,601
I put everything at stake in this war.

1395
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:08,404
My life, my career, my family.

1396
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:10,921
Even my kid. And you're
saying don't make it personal.

1397
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:12,041
Have you f**** lost it.

1398
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:14,481
The kid will come
back, Nisheeth. He'll come.

1399
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:16,848
lam your friend, your colleague.

1400
01:52:17,001 --> 01:52:20,562
Try and understand one thing.

1401
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:22,291
It's always about the normalcy"".

1402
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:25,284
..about their relationship
over here and those in power in there.

1403
01:52:25,321 --> 01:52:26,971
It's always about those in power there..

1404
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,411
..and those in power over here.

1405
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:30,403
That bond is solid.
That bond is not broken.

1406
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:32,807
Nothing is broken. So
you don't need to fix it.

1407
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:35,491
I care a f*** about their
f**** bond with these criminals.

1408
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:37,522
I care a f*** about
their attitude towards us.

1409
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:39,762
<i>Their Wâ greed.
Their Wâ ârndrï¬erences.</i>

1410
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:41,524
Their f***** double-standards.

1411
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:44,729
What-s this .l.-**** going on?

1412
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:47,801
Sharma, I hope you know..

1413
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:49,609
""the meaning of a conspiracy.

1414
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:54,325
Don't act smart with
us. -I am not acting smart.

1415
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:56,528
Then talk in Hindi. Hindi.

1416
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:57,761
In our mother tongue.

1417
01:52:57,840 --> 01:52:59,171
So that I can understand too.

1418
01:52:59,241 --> 01:53:00,766
I was trying to explain Nisheeth..

1419
01:53:00,841 --> 01:53:03,492
..that he can get
his kid back if he leaves.

1420
01:53:03,721 --> 01:53:06,167
The
Administration.. -To hell with his kid.

1421
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:11,410
My master's being
tortured for the past 48 hours.

1422
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:13,922
Don't give me that look.

1423
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:16,766
You have no value here.

1424
01:53:17,161 --> 01:53:18,686
Take your wife and get out of here.

1425
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:20,802
Shut the f*** up. Shut up.

1426
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:23,284
Collector, you..

1427
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:24,441
Stay down.

1428
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:26,608
I said f**** stay down!

1429
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:47,324
Sir, you're the Collector and..

1430
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:52,008
Hey lawyer: I am
still the Collector here.

1431
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:54,489
I haven't received his orders..

1432
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:56,882
..or handed over my charge.

1433
01:53:57,400 --> 01:54:01,166
This is my office, and
its filled with scam files..

1434
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:06,203
..and your witness is the prime suspect.

1435
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:11,491
I hope you know the
meaning of armed intrusion.

1436
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:15,121
Sharma. Better explain him.

1437
01:54:15,401 --> 01:54:17,563
As district
Collector what powers I have..

1438
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:20,202
..to safeguard my sphere of duty.

1439
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:24,160
Or do I explain him? -I get it.

1440
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:26,965
Come on, Sadhu sir.
It's best to leave from here.

1441
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:29,122
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go, Sadhu sir.

1442
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:31,441
This Collector has lost his mind.

1443
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:41,485
Sir, technically speaking..

1444
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:45,248
lam on indefinite leave.

1445
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:51,601
I can't take anyone's charge..

1446
01:54:52,521 --> 01:54:57,004
..or handover anyone's transfer orders.

1447
01:54:59,881 --> 01:55:02,248
And you're free to
take any action you like.

1448
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:04,171
Sharma.

1449
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:11,888
Thank you. -Hope not to see you.

1450
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:26,240
It was Saryu Bhan's time to die.

1451
01:55:26,761 --> 01:55:28,411
But took him instead. -Meaning.

1452
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:32,289
It means.. if we had
taken Saryu Bhan tonight.

1453
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:36,483
..then this
would've been his last night.

1454
01:55:38,281 --> 01:55:43,321
We've information that the
tribal descendants plan to attack..

1455
01:55:43,401 --> 01:55:45,324
..his master Saryu
Bhan Singh's empire today.

1456
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:54,367
When did you get this information?

1457
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:56,761
Yeste rd ay.

1458
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:00,167
And you're telling me today, lyer.

1459
01:56:00,681 --> 01:56:05,164
I know.. the
situation can get out of control.

1460
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:09,042
It's better to stay quiet
instead of alerting the system.

1461
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:11,922
You know this better.

1462
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,923
But those"" who are
losing their innocent kin..

1463
01:56:14,761 --> 01:56:17,844
..in this violence won't understand.

1464
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:25,607
I did this for your son.

1465
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:29,001
What will you tell Meetu?

1466
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:30,411
Where's Nimesh?

1467
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:32,410
I'll tell her..

1468
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,484
I'll tell her that he's dead.

1469
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:37,327
It's easier than saying that.

1470
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:40,843
...I killed the law to save my son.

1471
01:56:45,801 --> 01:56:47,405
Everyone is informed that.

1472
01:56:47,480 --> 01:56:51,087
..Maoist attacked on
Rajapur's Naya Mod police station.

1473
01:56:51,120 --> 01:56:55,364
The entire district
is under Maoist attack.

1474
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:38,683
The people believe
this incident is the result..

1475
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:40,364
..of the government's effort on..

1476
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:42,687
""putting a leash on the coal mafia.

1477
01:57:43,081 --> 01:57:46,528
The chief of one of the
labor union in this area told us..

1478
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:49,010
This was bound to happen.

1479
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:50,923
If you can't protect us..

1480
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,968
..then we'll have to protect ourselves.

1481
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:55,808
This attack is a
fitting reply from the tribal..

1482
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,083
And if this continues,
then the coal mafia will soon..

1483
01:58:16,361 --> 01:58:17,522
Hi, Nisheeth.

1484
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:40,881
Look, sir.

1485
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:42,689
We made their leader surrender as well.

1486
01:58:43,160 --> 01:58:44,730
The battle is won at least.

1487
01:58:46,360 --> 01:58:50,524
Who won or lost
doesn't make a difference.

1488
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:53,489
We lost our people on both sides.

1489
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,240
Poor Indians.

1490
01:58:56,120 --> 01:58:57,849
So what's the point of this victory?

1491
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:01,641
Someday people will
sing praises of Puran Santhali.

1492
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:02,881
Understand.

1493
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:04,843
And anyway, I've made your job easier.

1494
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:07,282
Explain them my value.

1495
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:09,842
They are dragging me like an animal.

1496
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,525
I've been trying to explain them.

1497
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:16,721
Sir.

1498
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:19,649
I think we need him at the press-con.

1499
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:36,284
Master told me to keep this from you.

1500
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:41,081
You're the master's
honor, you're his pride.

1501
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:43,091
His last hope.

1502
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:46,928
He didn't want to put you in danger.

1503
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:51,771
Master has lived all
his life for his honor.

1504
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:56,962
He even refused to
recognize his son's body.

1505
02:00:57,280 --> 02:01:00,602
To show that no one can murder..

1506
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:02,524
..Saryu Bhan Singh's son.

1507
02:01:04,280 --> 02:01:07,124
He hasn't even
performed the final rites.

1508
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,685
One has to say that the
young master's lives abroad.

1509
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:13,121
What to do?

1510
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:15,645
It's the question of master's honor.

1511
02:01:17,801 --> 02:01:19,212
40 years.

1512
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:24,050
I've kept the master's
honor intact for 40 years.

1513
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:27,210
Time's changing.

1514
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:31,043
The master's been damned.

1515
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:34,285
The effect's going to show.

1516
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:38,131
If they master stays alive"".

1517
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:40,364
...he'll never be able to tolerate it.

1518
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:45,842
The master's lived
all his life with pride..

1519
02:01:47,160 --> 02:01:49,003
..so send him away similarly.

1520
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:51,682
Give him salvation.

1521
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:57,162
If he dies by your
hand, he'll be immortal.

1522
02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:02,363
One Karua kills the other""

1523
02:02:04,720 --> 02:02:06,484
..it doesn't look good.

1524
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,650
<i>He's a mad haâ</i>

1525
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:12,243
Nisheeth.. we cannot
negotiate with these people.

1526
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:13,686
Except for death.

1527
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:15,768
lam the administrative
head of this district, sir.

1528
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:17,200
Collector.

1529
02:03:17,680 --> 02:03:19,808
Still I'm letting him use me..

1530
02:03:19,880 --> 02:03:21,723
..for my own personal interest.

1531
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:25,643
What message will
the people get from this?

1532
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:29,009
Do you think I am being selfish?

1533
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:35,284
In the last 24 hours 113 soldiers died.

1534
02:03:37,480 --> 02:03:40,848
Even we are normal people with family.

1535
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:44,971
This message should
be delivered to the people.

1536
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:49,001
Otherwise they will either
consider us God or the devil.

1537
02:03:50,200 --> 02:03:53,647
I am as strong as you are.

1538
02:03:54,080 --> 02:03:56,890
I am as helpless as you are.

1539
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,490
Try to understand.

1540
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:02,570
Help us.

1541
02:04:03,720 --> 02:04:06,963
This message should
be delivered to the people.

1542
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:15,364
Give me strength, Goddess.

1543
02:04:46,040 --> 02:04:47,724
Why did he call us here?

1544
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:54,123
Because he knows no
one can follow him here.

1545
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:57,807
Forget about running,
you can't even walk here.

1546
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:02,525
This is their personal hell..

1547
02:05:03,120 --> 02:05:06,203
..and only they can thrive here.

1548
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:10,566
Where is he?

1549
02:05:11,160 --> 02:05:12,161
Hello.

1550
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:13,850
Have you brought the master along?

1551
02:05:14,200 --> 02:05:15,201
Yes.

1552
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:16,681
Send him.

1553
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:18,610
ls my son fine?

1554
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:24,569
Call Saryu Bhan.

1555
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,047
Go on.

1556
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:47,486
Saryu Bhan.

1557
02:05:49,560 --> 02:05:51,403
He has my child.

1558
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:56,922
I'll be grateful if you spare his life.

1559
02:05:59,080 --> 02:06:01,731
You've shown me so many facets of death.

1560
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:04,763
I can't comply with it all my life.

1561
02:06:05,240 --> 02:06:07,686
Please show a facet of mercy..

1562
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:10,288
..and I'll be grateful forever.

1563
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:12,807
I wish you had shown
this compassion on day 1..

1564
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:15,849
..then this would've never happened.

1565
02:06:17,480 --> 02:06:22,247
Your foolishness has
made the entire area insecure.

1566
02:06:23,680 --> 02:06:28,527
Mr. Collector, you
humiliated his father.

1567
02:06:30,720 --> 02:06:32,404
This is coal religion.

1568
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:35,368
They understand only one law.

1569
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:38,926
Either burn yourself or decimate others.

1570
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:42,007
This is why everyone worships coal here.

1571
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:50,403
It won't be easy to convince him.

1572
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:53,250
But I will try.

1573
02:07:32,240 --> 02:07:35,483
So.. you got the news.

1574
02:07:37,240 --> 02:07:38,605
Why are you crying?

1575
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:41,051
I am absolutely fine.

1576
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:43,967
Such high and lows are normal.

1577
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,604
But why did you come here?

1578
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:51,882
Don't you know how
dangerous this place is?

1579
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:54,403
And you called me here too.

1580
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:59,447
Karua, leave with the child.

1581
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:04,645
Can you see the child?

1582
02:08:05,400 --> 02:08:08,882
He's on the ground there.
But God knows what they are up to.

1583
02:08:12,080 --> 02:08:14,287
I won't leave my land.

1584
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:16,922
You have to Karua.

1585
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:19,680
They've got you in their sights.

1586
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:20,961
I am there.

1587
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:23,647
I'll clear them out.

1588
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:25,806
No, master.

1589
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,765
Tell this land to devour me.

1590
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:31,606
Karua.

1591
02:08:32,280 --> 02:08:33,850
What are you saying?

1592
02:08:34,680 --> 02:08:36,364
I beg you.

1593
02:08:38,760 --> 02:08:41,366
I know no God, except for you.

1594
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:46,284
You're my day and night.

1595
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:51,569
I breathe because of you.

1596
02:08:54,160 --> 02:08:56,925
You're the benefactor of my world.

1597
02:09:00,200 --> 02:09:02,885
I never asked you for anything.

1598
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:06,606
But I will today.

1599
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:10,163
Order Koye
aancha
..

1600
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:13,121
..to devour us both.

1601
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:15,401
Karua.

1602
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:17,121
Yes, master.

1603
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:19,525
Give the orders.

1604
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:23,006
Son, what's going on in your mind?

1605
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:27,927
If you're blamed for my sins, then""

1606
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,765
..may the merits of
good deeds be conferred on you.

1607
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:37,246
I understood one thing, Master.

1608
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:43,245
In order to keep your world intact.

1609
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:47,409
...I ruined heaven.

1610
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:53,611
I want to rectify my mistake, master.

1611
02:09:57,480 --> 02:09:59,209
Help me.

1612
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:03,328

1614
02:10:14,080 --> 02:10:15,525

Devour us Koyelaanchal.

1625
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:51,283
Didn't you hear the master's order?

1626
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:53,489
Devour us.

1627
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:55,564
Devour us.

1628
02:10:55,880 --> 02:10:57,609

Liberate us mother!

Sorry.

1645
02:12:40,280 --> 02:12:41,645
Forgive me.

1646
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:43,131
Sorry.

1647
02:14:06,520 --> 02:14:08,124
A woman came here..

1648
02:14:08,840 --> 02:14:10,251
..a little while ago.

1649
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:14,004
Here's your child.

1650
02:14:14,080 --> 02:14:15,650
My son.

1651
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:23,481
My son.

1652
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:25,970
My son.

1653
02:14:31,200 --> 02:14:32,725
Where did you find him?

1654
02:14:34,200 --> 02:14:36,043
Someone asked me to give him to you.

1655
02:14:36,400 --> 02:14:37,401
Who?

1656
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:39,807
But.. -A demon had abducted him.

1657
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:42,289
And an angel returned him.

1658
02:14:43,480 --> 02:14:44,891
Angel?

1659
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:47,251
My husband.

1660
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:58,084
Did you get married today?

1661
02:15:00,280 --> 02:15:01,486
Yes.

1662
02:15:03,040 --> 02:15:04,849
And I also became a widow today.

1663
02:15:07,880 --> 02:15:09,120
Who are you?

1664
02:15:10,640 --> 02:15:12,642
I fed him my milk.

1665
02:15:14,680 --> 02:15:17,923
Consider me his other mother.

1666
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:29,168
And.. pray that

Chucking the phone
won't prove anything, Puja.

Mummy.

100
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,500
Why don't you get some help?

101
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,370
Idiot! You've made my life hell.

102
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,120
Actually, I'm not interested in
talking to you either. Understand?

103
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,790
I just called to say...

104
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,080
that I'm going to miss
my flight again because of you.

105
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,790
You didn't pack my bags
or iron my clothes.

106
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,330
You knew I had an
important meeting in Kolkata.

107
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,750
What difference does it make to you?

108
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,040
Even if someone's
flying out in the morning...

109
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,700
you still want to butt heads.

110
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,620
Hello. Puja?

111
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,950
Are you listening?

112
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,700
Mummy.

113
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,870
Okay.

114
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,830
Just go to hell!

115
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,290
And listen, I forgot to turn
off the iron in a hurry.

116
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,620
And it's entirely your fault.

117
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,750
You females are the
worst thing in any man's life!

118
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,370
Whether you live or die...

119
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,540
I don't care about you at all.

120
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,200
But Pihu's at home.

121
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,660
So see to it that you turn it off.

122
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,750
And what's wrong with Pihu?
Why is she crying?

123
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,040
Hello. Pihu.

124
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,410
- Hello.
- Papa.

125
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,870

126
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:39,750
- Pihu my love.
- Papa, mamma is here only.

127
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,790
Papa, I am coming. Yes, dear...

128
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:47,410
Papa is going to Kolkata. Hello.

129
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,700
Pihu.

130
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,370
My love. Give papa a kiss.

131
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,500
Come on.

132
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,370
Okay, bye.

133
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,660
Hello, Puja.

134
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,080
Hello.

135
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,790
Damn it!

136
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,160
Mamma is hurt.

137
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,500
Mamma needs cream.

138
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,870
Mamma, where is the cream?

139
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:38,120
Gaurav, I fought with my folks to
marry you, but what did I get from you?

140
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:44,950
You said, you'll return
home only after I'm dead

141
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,540
I am going away

142
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:53,250
I wanted to take Pihu along,
but I didn't have the guts to do it.

143
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,120
Goodbye - Puja.

144
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:26,580
Look at me now.

145
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,040
Mummy.

146
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:29,160
Look, the peacock took the peahen away.
What little was left, the thief took away.

147
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:39,750
Stop being angry, let's get back to play,
cheer up girl, throw all sadness away.

148
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,660
Mamma, sing the rhyme for me.

149
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,040
This is my cream. These are my hands.

150
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,080
See my hands.

151
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,870
What do I have in my hands?

152
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:12,080
Cream. Look Mamma, cream on my hands.

153
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,000
See, Mamma.

154
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,790
Mamma, smoke.

155
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,080
Mamma, where is the smoke coming from?

156
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,120
Mamma, can I turn this off?

157
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,120
How did it happen?

158
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,200
Mamma, where is the smoke coming from?

159
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,750
Mamma!

160
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,750
Mummy!

161
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:33,700
Mummy!

162
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,950
Mamma, I want milk.

163
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,620
Get up, Mamma.

164
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,870
Please get up.

165
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,540
Mamma!

166
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,290
Oh no...

167
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,330
Oh no...

168
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,910
One. Two. Three. Four.

169
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,540
Pihu's bread.

170
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,790
Stop. Please.

171
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,080
Mummy!

172
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,950
Mamma!

173
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,700
Any trash?

174
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,750
Madam, any trash?

175
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,290
Pihu is coming.

176
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,580
I am eating jam.

177
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,330
Wait, I am coming.

178
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:00,910
Eat... come on, eat.

179
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,500
You must eat your food...

180
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,500
Eat.

181
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,750
Eat...

182
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,330
Mummy..

183
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:14,120
Mummy, you must eat.

184
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:27,410
Go on, eat. Take...

185
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:28,950
Come on, eat.

186
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,370
Eat.

187
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:50,750
One-two-three.

188
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,160
One-two-three.

189
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,330
One-two-three.

190
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,160
One-two-three.

191
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,450
One-two-three.

192
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,580
One-two-three.

193
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,080
What are you saying?

194
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,000
Bomb, Bomb, Bomb.

195
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,040
Mummy.

196
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:32,950
Hello.

197
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:33,910
Hello.

198
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:34,950
Hello.

199
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,700
Pihu, - Hello, papa.

200
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:39,290
Baby, where is Mamma.
Give the phone to Mamma.

201
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,700
Mamma. Papa's phone.

202
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,370
What happened, mamma?

203
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:45,040
Puja.

204
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,080
- I've boarded the airplane.
- Excuse me, sir.

205
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:48,950
I'm calling from
the airplane's toilet.

206
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,160
My phone will be switched
off for two hours.

207
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,790
I just wanted to ask whether
you turned off the iron or not?

208
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,250
You know that...

209
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:57,636
- the iron's automatic function isn't working.
- 'Excuse me, sir.'

210
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,750
Hello.

211
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,120
Hello, Puja. Talk to me.

212
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,080
- Excuse me, sir.
- Hello.

213
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,500
Excuse me, sir.

214
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,950
Please come out, sir.

215
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,766
- Phones are not allowed, sir.
- That's the problem with you.

216
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,750
You have a very short temper.

217
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,870
Fine, I admit I was late yesterday.

218
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,790
I couldn't be on time
for Pihu's birthday.

219
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:15,790
But did we have to
argue over it all night?

220
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,790
- Switch off your phone sir.
- Yeah, just two minutes.

221
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,306
And why did you drag
Meera in our argument?

222
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:23,120
Who the hell is Meera between us?

223
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,080
You know she's just a colleague.

224
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:27,500
And she's your friend, not mine.

225
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,870
Phones are not allowed, sir.

226
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,000
- Please, sir.
- Hello.

227
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,700
Hello.

228
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,080
Hello.

229
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,750
Hello...

230
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:40,330
Hello!

231
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,250
Mamma, the phone's turned off.

232
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,950
This is Pihu's phone.

233
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:16,580
Mummy.

234
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,410
Uff...

235
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:08,750
Madam, milk.

236
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:10,500
Wait, coming.

237
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,830
Pinky, call the guard.

238
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:18,450
These guys at 903 are driving me nuts.

239
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,290
What do you want? Hello, madam.

240
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:21,620
- Guard!
- What's the matter?

241
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,726
- Guard!
- None of the doorbells are working, madam?

242
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:24,910
No electricity?

243
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,160
The generator's getting fixed.

244
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:29,226
Power supply will be restored soon.

245
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:30,290
See, power's back.

246
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,410
I just wanted to know...

247
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,886
What did you break this time, Pinky?

248
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:34,410
Have the people in 804 gone out?

249
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,660
I had brought cow's
milk for the child.

250
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,926
- But no one's opening the door.
- How the hell would I know?

251
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:40,250
Check with the guard. Go.

252
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:44,160
They kept partying all night.
I couldn't sleep a wink.

253
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:46,330
Are they still sleeping? At this hour?

254
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:47,830
How would I know?

255
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:49,450
That is not our problem.

256
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,580
Pinky!

257
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,120
- I thought since you're their neighbor,
- Pinky!

258
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:54,370
You would know.

259
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:55,700
What neighbor!

260
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:57,266
We didn't even get
invited to the party.

261
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:59,700
Damn you!

262
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:04,500
Madam, can you please
hand over this milk to them?

263
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:07,660
Go give it to the people in 705.

264
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,870
Such a temper is not good

265
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:15,120
I am only doing my job.
You didn't have to yell at me.

266
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:04,660
Mummy!

267
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,830
Guard. Guard.

268
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:53,870
Yes.

269
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,580
See what's the commotion all about.

270
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,500
This place is not
fit to live in anymore.

271
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,830
- Okay, I'll take a look.
- Hurry up.

272
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,500
Mamma!

273
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:49,330
Come out, Mamma.

274
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,250
Oww!

275
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:49,500
Mamma, I want to play.

276
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:52,370
I'll see you, Mummy.

277
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:02,950
Amogh! Listen, Amogh.

278
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:05,830
Amogh.

279
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:07,830
Ishika.

280
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:11,950
Amogh, see Pihu's doll.

281
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,080
Ishika.

282
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,450
Amogh.

283
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:30,870
Amogh isn't speaking to me.

284
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,330
Mamma, come out.

285
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,250
Amogh.

286
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,660
Ishika.

287
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,660
Aarav is always after me.

288
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:49,830
Aarav.

289
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:53,660
He's not speaking to me.

290
00:53:57,250 --> 00:54:00,000
Ishika, see Pihu's doll.

291
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,580
Listen, Amogh.

292
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,950
Damn!

293
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,540
Shameless people!

294
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:22,120
No manners at all.

295
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:25,910
Damn, Damn.

296
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:30,870
They have money...

297
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:32,540
but when will
they learn some sense?

298
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:33,910
Oh-oh!

299
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,160
It hurts.

300
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:03,660
A cut.

301
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:05,540
I am hurt.

302
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,500
I'll fall.

303
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:19,080
Mummy.

304
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:35,620
Mamma.

305
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:38,910
Mamma.

306
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:43,830
Get up, please.

307
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:53,330
Ishika, bring Pihu's doll.

308
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,580
Listen, Amogh Bring Pihu's doll.

309
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:49,250
Amogh, Ishika.

310
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:51,330
Bring Pihu's doll.

311
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,080
Amogh.

312
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,290
No. No. No, baby.

313
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:06,040
Get down, baby.

314
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:08,120
Whose child is that?

315
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,330
Is anyone listening?

316
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:12,290
Look where she's standing?

317
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:14,200
Aunty, Pihu's doll.

318
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,040
What are you saying, baby?

319
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,620
Pihu's doll.

320
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:18,950
What?

321
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,250
Pihu's doll.

322
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,120
Aunty will bring the doll, baby.

323
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,410
Pihu's doll.

324
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,660
Where is your mamma, baby?

325
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,040
Mamma sleeping.

326
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:29,290
Call your Mamma. Go to your mamma.

327
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:30,500
Get down.

328
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:31,500
Hello! Is anybody there?

329
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:32,910
Is anyone watching her?

330
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,290
Pihu's doll.

331
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:36,700
Yes, baby. Aunty will get your doll.

332
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:39,370
Get down. Get down, baby.

333
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:42,750
Hey guard, why don't you
go up and check on that kid.

334
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:44,120
Someone check on her.

335
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:46,200
Baby, down. Get down.

336
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:47,870
Pihu's doll.

337
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,580
Down, baby. Very good.

338
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,370
Good girl.

339
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,200
Mamma plane.

340
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,040
Mamma papa's home.

341
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:07,160
Mamma come out.

342
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:32,660
Hey Puja, this is Meera.

343
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:35,370
I know you're not talking today.

344
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,660
But why do you keep
behaving like this?

345
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:39,500
What's gotten into you?

346
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:42,580
I am very happy with my married life.
You know that.

347
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,500
Hello, are you listening?

348
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:48,120
Listen, I am coming over to see you.

349
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,950
Mamma, what is aunty saying?

350
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,540
I am coming over
without your permission.

351
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:54,620
- What is aunty saying?
- Hello.

352
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,540
Hello.

353
00:58:57,830 --> 00:58:58,910
Pihu.

354
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:02,200
M... M...

355
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,540
Love you. See you soon.

356
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:07,750
I was calling.

357
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:11,700
Which aunty is this?

358
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:13,160
Aunty.

359
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,160
Aunty.

360
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:35,580
- Guard.
- Yes.

361
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:37,950
Why is the power supply fluctuating?

362
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,330
It will blow a fuse.

363
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,200
The generator's still
getting fixed, madam.

364
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:45,660
Power will be restored shortly.

365
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:40,450
Mamma, what is this?

366
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:42,290
Pihu is crying.

367
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,870
Mummy, look..
When I was a little baby.

368
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:51,040
See... little baby.

369
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:53,450
Little baby gets a kiss.

370
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,700
When I was a little baby.

371
01:00:57,790 --> 01:00:59,540
Mamma, Papa has come home.

372
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:01,870
Papa has come home.

373
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,330
Pintu, Pintu.

374
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:23,160
Send your brother down.
To help me carry this stuff.

375
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:35,830
Papa...

376
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,410
Its papa... Papa's picture.

377
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:44,250
Hello.

378
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:46,830
Puja... Puja I am...

379
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,040
Hello.

380
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,200
Hello.

381
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:51,370
Hello.

382
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,580
- Pihu.
- Hello.

383
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:55,790
Pihu. Pihu.

384
01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:57,810
Give the phone to your mamma, baby.

385
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,500
Papa has to go for a meeting.

386
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:01,080
Give her the phone now.

387
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:04,350
Stop playing with the phone, baby.
The line will get disconnected.

388
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:05,120
Please...

389
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,790
Mamma sleeping.

390
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,790
What are you saying, baby?

391
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:10,250
Mamma sleeping.

392
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:11,750
Mamma's sleeping.

393
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:15,250
Where is Papa?

394
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:16,080
Papa...

395
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,790
Papa's in Kolkata, baby.

396
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:20,790
- Mamma's in Kolkata.
- No baby, papa, not mamma.

397
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:23,540
Pihu. Will you do one thing for papa?

398
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:26,200
Hello. Pihu.

399
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:27,950
Come home, papa.

400
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,790
Yes, baby. Papa will come tomorrow.

401
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:34,250
Tell mamma... papa said...

402
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:35,750
Sorry.

403
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,360
What will you tell mamma, dear?

404
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,790
Will you tell mamma?

405
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:40,330
Sorry.

406
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:41,910
Okay, baby. Bye.

407
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,516
Papa's keeping the phone down now.

408
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:45,830
Papa will call back in one hour.
Okay, baby.

409
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:46,910
Papa loves you.

410
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:15,330
""Twinkle-Twinkle Little Star.""

411
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:18,370
""Twinkle-Twinkle Little Star.""

412
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:21,120
""Ring-a Ring-a Roses.""

413
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:24,200
""Ring-a Ring-a Roses.""

414
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:26,040
Meow, Tell me a story.

415
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:31,450
Meow-Meow.

416
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:16,790
Hello.

417
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:17,580
Good morning, madam.

418
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:19,370
Sorry. Good afternoon madam.

419
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:21,790
Am I talking to
Mrs. Puja Gupta Chaudhary?

420
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:26,120
Madam, I am speaking from
Bold and Beautiful Helpline.

421
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,120
We have a tie-up with
each and every beauty salon.

422
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,330
And we...

423
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:31,790
Mamma, say hello.

424
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:33,910
And we offer up-to-date services.

425
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:37,830
Like with an expensive hair-cut,
you'll get a bleach free.

426
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:40,290
And full body waxing plus...

427
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:42,410
Hello. Hello.

428
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:44,660
Can you hear me?

429
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:48,160
Why don't you hang up
if you're not interested?

430
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:49,790
Don't waste our time.

431
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:51,830
Look, Mamma.

432
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:54,790
Mamma... Get up.

433
01:05:58,620 --> 01:05:59,950
Mamma, food.

434
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,750
Get up, please.

435
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:04,910
Mamma, food.

436
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,790
Mummy.

437
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,750
Mummy.

438
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:21,450
Can I drink milk?

439
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,790
Can I drink milk?

440
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:25,660
Can I drink milk?

441
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,410
Mamma, Pihu's milk.

442
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,450
Oh no.

443
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:52,830
Get up, please.

444
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:57,830
Mamma, feed me.

445
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:04,750
Mummy.

446
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:05,910
Oh ho.

447
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,120
Mamma.

448
01:09:57,830 --> 01:10:00,080
It is all wet.

449
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:25,580
Mr. Gaurav.

450
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:27,450
Mr. Gaurav.

451
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:28,540
Yes...

452
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,660
Anybody home?

453
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:37,660
Hello. Hello.

454
01:10:37,950 --> 01:10:39,290
I guess no one's in.

455
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:45,450
Bunch of idiots.

456
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:48,290
They left the tap open.

457
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:54,540
This is so ridiculous...

458
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:56,160
We must complain about this.

459
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:57,250
Yes...

460
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:00,450
Even the power supply has
made our life hell today.

461
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:03,120
Yeah... it's getting difficult
to live here anymore.

462
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:04,830
Mr. Gaurav.

463
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:07,040
Mr. Gaurav.

464
01:11:13,790 --> 01:11:16,250
Let's go.
Get the generator fixed first.

465
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:17,790
Wait, I am coming.

466
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:21,580
Papa's calling...

467
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:22,370
Hello.

468
01:12:22,450 --> 01:12:24,160
Papa, tell me a story.

469
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:25,290
Pihu.

470
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:27,040
Pihu, give the phone to Mamma.

471
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:29,790
Pihu.

472
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:31,580
Hello.

473
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,450
Hello, Pihu.

474
01:12:34,330 --> 01:12:35,330
Pihu.

475
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:37,200
Papa, tell me a story first.

476
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:38,370
Yes, baby.

477
01:12:41,330 --> 01:12:43,950
And a tiger came at night.

478
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:48,370
The tiger started
coming closer slowly.

479
01:12:49,290 --> 01:12:51,040
He saw Noni.

480
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,330
And what did the tiger say?

481
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:54,660
Noni...

482
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:59,450
I will eat Noni's pony.

483
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,120
Pihu's coughing?

484
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,040
Go tell mamma to give you medicine.

485
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,540
- Papa, mamma's gone.
- What?

486
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:09,870
Mamma's gone?

487
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:11,660
Where did mamma go?

488
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,160
Pihu, call mamma.

489
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:15,950
Mamma's not here.

490
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,540
What are you saying, baby?

491
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:18,620
Where is Mamma?

492
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:20,870
Tell me where Mamma is.

493
01:13:20,950 --> 01:13:22,620
Mamma's gone to Kolkata.

494
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,080
What, baby?

495
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:25,700
Mamma's gone to Kolkata.

496
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:29,290
Papa's in Kolkata, baby.
Mamma is with you.

497
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:31,250
Mamma sleeping. Mamma sleeping.

498
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:34,000
Is Mamma is still sleeping, Pihu?

499
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:37,410
Go wake up Mamma.

500
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:38,830
Mamma sleeping. Mamma sleeping.

501
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:40,910
And say, Mamma good morning.

502
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:42,000
Pihu...

503
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,200
Mamma sleeping.

504
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:43,950
Go, baby.

505
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,750
Mamma sleeping. Mamma sleeping.

506
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:46,830
Pihu...

512
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:56,370
Yes.

513
01:13:56,450 --> 01:13:57,790
But it's no parking.

514
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,120
I am telling you just stop here.

515
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,830
Mamma sleeping. Mamma sleeping.

519
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:12,410
Hello.

521
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:18,250
Have you seen my other phone?

522
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:18,830

546
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,950
How much longer to the airport?

547
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,080
One hour.

548
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:26,080
What? One hour.

549
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:27,830

You were supposed to meet Puja today.

01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:47,830
Did you go see her?

559
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,370
Hope all is well there?

560
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:52,660

Listen, can you do me a favor?

I am driving faster. You can see...

566
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:07,160
- See what?
- The roads.

567
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:08,750
It's jammed.

568
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:10,660
Kolkata - what a stupid city!

569
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:14,870
Hello, Pihu. Papa's coming home.

570
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,330
Go to Mamma.

571
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,950
Mamma is sleeping.

572
01:16:19,330 --> 01:16:20,870
I'm not going to wake her up.

573
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:23,250
I will sit here.

574
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:30,620
Mamma, the phone is not working.

575
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,580
A fly is coming.

576
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,290
Eat?

577
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:54,870
Can I eat this?

578
01:17:58,790 --> 01:17:59,870
Can I eat this?

579
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:02,660
Can I eat this?

580
01:18:08,410 --> 01:18:10,790
The medicine is bitter.

581
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:19,620
Mamma, I want more.

582
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:26,950
Can I eat more?

583
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:35,790
Can I eat more, mamma?

584
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:51,660
I'm done.

585
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:58,000
I ate your bitter medicines.

586
01:18:58,870 --> 01:19:00,450
I'm done Mamma.

587
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,790
- Did anyone call the fire brigade?
- Yes.

588
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:37,580
I knew something was wrong.

589
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:40,750
Why is the water coming out?

590
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,250
If I hadn't warned everyone...

591
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:43,556
then the fire would've
spread throughout the building.

592
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:44,580
Where is Gaurav?

593
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:46,870
You're a strong guy.
Break the door down.

594
01:22:46,950 --> 01:22:49,700
He called the Police.
Why call the police?

595
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,200
He should've called the fire brigade.

596
01:22:52,290 --> 01:22:53,620
I went to the guard.

597
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:55,290
Does anyone have a hammer?

598
01:22:55,790 --> 01:22:57,370
Let's break the lock.

599
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,830
Let's everyone break
the door down together.

600
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:01,200
There's water coming out.

601
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:03,500
Show some courage, please.

602
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:05,750
I can't do this alone.

603
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:07,410
We have to call a few more guys.

604
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:10,040
You're a young man.
Yes... Come on.

605
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:11,580
Break it down.

606
01:23:11,660 --> 01:23:14,750
- Let's push together.
- Yes.

607
01:23:17,870 --> 01:23:19,200
You just make tall claims.

608
01:23:19,290 --> 01:23:22,000
- Does anyone know where Gaurav is?
- God knows.

609
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:24,000
He's on the way. He's coming.

610
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,540
When will he get here?

611
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:27,660
I called him. He said he's coming.

612
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:30,000
They were partying all night.

613
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:58,700
Gaurav's here.

614
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:03,790
Let Gaurav through.

615
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000

01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:27,120
- See Papa, Pihu's home.
- Yes...

639
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:30,120
I built both the houses.

640

00:03:36,463 --> 00:03:37,487
Please have a seat, sir.

4
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:43,734
l thought l'd see you
tomorrow morning.

5
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,503
Then my PA told me about
your tight schedule.

6
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,842
Thank you, Ajay. -Thank you, sir.

7
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,870

Two days ago we received..

9
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:58,707
..your draft for two crores
and this contract.

10
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:02,179
We've studied it,
and we can work on it.

11
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:04,717
Well, then l guess it's a deal.

12
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:06,548
Sir, there's a small problem.

13
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:09,118
You've given us 5
service charge..

14
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:11,857
..and we were expecting 7.

15
00:04:12,198 --> 00:04:14,428
Before we discuss that
l'd like to see..

16
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:17,527
..the security arrangements and
facilities of your firm.

17
00:04:17,804 --> 00:04:21,296
Sure. -But for that, we'll have
to go to the third floor.

18
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:22,769
And we can discuss on the way.

19
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:24,672
Yeah sure. -Please, follow me.

00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:33,852
We send almost 50 of
the rough diamonds..

23
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,514
..from our mine to Jaipur,
for cutting and polishing.

24
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,587
But they're not very professional.

25
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:42,126
That's the reason why we want
to try out your firm.

Excuse me, we're here.

Sir. -Come.

28
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:50,832
This week, we'll be sending you..

29
00:04:50,904 --> 00:04:52,997
..500 karat diamonds
from South Africa.

30
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:57,034
lf we get quality as well
as on-time delivery..

31
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,743
..we'll increase our quota.

32
00:04:58,845 --> 00:05:01,245
That's great.
-So, before taking any decision..

33
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:03,646
..please look at the bigger
picture, Mr. Shantanu. -Sure.

34
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:13,919
Sir.
-This is our state-of-the-art..

35
00:05:14,027 --> 00:05:15,358
..cutting and polishing section.

36
00:05:15,462 --> 00:05:17,259
The workers' shift ends
at 6 other'clock.

37
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,854
That's why the room is
empty at the moment.

38
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:20,331
Excuse me, Mr. Singh.
-Yes, please.

39
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:28,565
ln this unit the polished
diamonds are matched..

40
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:29,903
..sorted and checked.

41
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,534
Excuse me for a minute. -Sure.

42
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,005
Yes, Mr. Jethmalani.

43
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:36,446
Yes, l've reached Mumbai.

44
00:05:37,784 --> 00:05:39,911
No, sorry, l won't be able
to come to your office.

45
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,078
lt's already seven.

46
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:45,090
Yes,
l suggest l'll send my secretary..

47
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:48,093
..Mr. Arjun Singh to your office.
He'll collect the papers.

48
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:49,817
Yes, of course.

49
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,561
We'll meet at the
minister's party.

50
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:52,829
Okay.

51
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,059
Arjun Singh. -Yes.

52
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,634
Go to Mr. Jethmalani's office
and collect the papers.

53
00:05:56,703 --> 00:05:57,829
Ok. -And come to the hotel.

54
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:00,364
You won't have any
problem going out.

55
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:02,063
The doors are open by them self.
-Fine.

56
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:05,840
There's a fixed paneling
of 12-inches..

57
00:06:05,912 --> 00:06:07,470
..on every wall of this floor.

58
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:10,072
This is the most secure
place in this building.

59
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:13,318
lt's impossible to get in here.

60
00:06:13,553 --> 00:06:16,488
The diamonds are sorted in
this windowed section.

61
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:20,158
And as you know,
natural light is very necessary.

62
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,888
Hi. Punch in your code. -Okay.

63
00:06:37,243 --> 00:06:38,710
The grills outside these windows..

64
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:42,146
..are made of 3-inches
thick stainless steel.

65
00:06:42,515 --> 00:06:44,380
Mike brother, where are you?

66
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:46,077
Hello.

67
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:49,515
Just to let you know, l'm in.

68
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:55,053
lt's time to win.

69
00:06:55,395 --> 00:06:57,556
At 8 other'clock in the night
when we shut down..

70
00:06:58,164 --> 00:07:01,224
..440 volts of current
run through them.

71
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:04,299
Coming in contact with them will
be hundred percent fatal.

72
00:07:10,243 --> 00:07:12,711
This grill can't be
blast open either.

73
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,104
l'm impressed.

74
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:17,212
This is a pretty good setup.

75
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:21,145
Shall we leave? -Please, come.

76
00:07:31,197 --> 00:07:33,256
And by the way,
the entire building is monitored..

77
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,302
..24-hours by close-circuit
cameras.

78
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:37,859
This place is like a fortress.

79
00:07:48,248 --> 00:07:49,772
l'm happy we're in safe hands.

80
00:07:50,316 --> 00:07:52,079
lt'll be a pleasure doing
business with you.

81
00:07:52,252 --> 00:07:53,241
Thank you, Mr. Damani.

82
00:07:53,586 --> 00:07:55,850
l assure you, there has never
been a theft here..

83
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:57,317
..and there will never be one.

84
00:07:57,624 --> 00:07:59,785
You won't have any complaints
from us.

85
00:10:16,763 --> 00:10:19,061
Mike, all set? -Yes.

86
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:20,397
Good.

87
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:22,798
So, we're ready to play.
-Yes, we're in position.

88
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,734
lt's show time.

89
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:26,903
We're on.

90
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:54,386
Let's go up. Something's wrong.

91
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,960
Prince. -Mike, what's up?

92
00:12:03,636 --> 00:12:05,661
Prince, the guards are coming up.
What should we do?

93
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:07,330
Should we abort? -No way.

94
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:11,603
Mike, plan B.

95
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,577
lt's plan B.

96
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:35,366
$Oh no. Call for back up. -Yes.

97
00:12:38,204 --> 00:12:39,296
Alert! Alert! Alert!

98
00:12:39,605 --> 00:12:41,129
$Come on, come on. Let's go.

99
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,338
$That way. Hurry up.

100
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:56,246
$Come on, quickly.

101
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:27,542
$Sir, target has stopped.

102
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:29,778
Put your hands up in the air!

103
00:13:30,957 --> 00:13:32,424
Don't move, don't move!

104
00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:38,420
l said, don't move!

105
00:13:38,731 --> 00:13:39,925
Or we'll fire!

106
00:13:40,466 --> 00:13:41,558
$Watch out.

107
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:45,969
lt's show time.

108
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:47,862
$Oh no, he has jumped.

109
00:13:48,074 --> 00:13:49,473
$Target has jumped off the roof.

110
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:51,804
$l repeat,
target has jumped off the roof.

111
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:48,759
$Darn.

112
00:14:51,837 --> 00:14:54,431
$As you can see,
we're standing right outside..

113
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:57,100
The office of Diamond Corporation
of lndia..

114
00:14:57,176 --> 00:14:58,507
..where the biggest theft
of the millennium..

115
00:14:58,578 --> 00:15:00,978
..has been committed. -We've
learnt from reliable sources..

116
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,672
..that this theft has been
committed last night.

117
00:15:02,782 --> 00:15:04,682
This is the biggest heist
ever reported.

118
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,012
Yes,
the biggest heist ever report..

119
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:07,245
Yes,
let's watch what happens next.

120
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,049
The CBl is reaching
in a short while.

121
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:14,782
Excuse me, sir. Sir.

122
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:16,391
Sir. -Sir, one question please.

123
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:17,394
Sir, this is the job
of the local police.

124
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:18,691
Sir, one question please.
-No comments.

125
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:20,527
Sir, the thief was successful
in pulling off the heist..

126
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,798
..inspite of such foolproof
arrangements.

127
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,304
-Thought DCOl kept the..

128
00:15:27,873 --> 00:15:29,272
Why are you glorifying him?

129
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:31,404
He's just a thief and not God.

130
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:32,967
Sir, don't you wonder
how he could commit..

131
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:35,775
..the robbery inspite of
such tight security?

132
00:15:35,848 --> 00:15:37,839
Security is only for
the white-collared.

133
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,540
So, sir, what's for the thieves?
-Please.

134
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:44,050
Prison. Only prison.
-Sir, one more question please.

135
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:48,060
This thief was very smart. -Okay.

136
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,752
All the recorded evidence we'd..

137
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:52,764
..in our video cameras,
he's erased everything.

138
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:54,629
Completely wiped them out, clean.
-Okay.

139
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:57,233
Did you find anything? -No.

140
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:58,759
Good morning, sir.

141
00:16:00,072 --> 00:16:01,505
You're a very positive man.

142
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,002
l see you at every crime scene..

143
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,775
..and you wish me 'Good morning,
sir'.

144
00:16:06,746 --> 00:16:08,407
lf anyone dies,
'Good morning, sir'.

145
00:16:09,115 --> 00:16:11,606
lf there's a bomb blast,
even then 'Good morning, sir'.

146
00:16:12,018 --> 00:16:13,110
Sir, you're my senior.

147
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:16,881
And.. it's my duty to wish
you good morning.

148
00:16:17,623 --> 00:16:19,181
Your duty is to catch
the criminal.

149
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:21,426
Any clues? -No, sir.

150
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:24,124
We only got the staff's
fingerprints.

151
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,422
And no one else's.

152
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:27,798
Mark this. -Yes.

153
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,958
He's a very cunning thief.

154
00:16:29,502 --> 00:16:32,369
Notjust one or two, but he has
stolen kilos of diamonds.

155
00:16:33,406 --> 00:16:34,703
And from this little hole.

156
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:38,675
Sir, l don't understand
how this is possible.

157
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:41,669
Wherever he goes anything
is possible.

158
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:43,313
Who's that, sir?

159
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:46,943
Prince.

160
00:17:06,706 --> 00:17:08,833
Come to me, darling.

162
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:16,310
Come to me, darling.

ln your arms..

164
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:22,447
Rock this party tonight.

165
00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:39,563
God.

166
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:45,267
Rock this party tonight.

167
00:17:45,344 --> 00:17:47,073
Oh my Lord.

168
00:17:47,213 --> 00:17:49,078

169
00:17:49,215 --> 00:17:52,582
l've lost contact with
both the worlds.

170
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:54,649
Oh my Lord.

171
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,754
l've lost my heart.

172
00:17:56,889 --> 00:18:00,416
l don't know when this happened.

173
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,387
Oh my Lord.

174
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:23,439
l'll inhibit your dreams.

175
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:26,946
l'll dwell in your eyes.

176
00:18:27,453 --> 00:18:31,014
My image will dwell
in your memory.

177
00:18:31,424 --> 00:18:34,985
No one will ever find me.

178
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:36,819
Oh my Lord.

179
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:38,690
l've lost my heart.

180
00:18:38,898 --> 00:18:42,595
l've lost contact with
both the worlds.

181
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:44,665
Oh my Lord.

182
00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:46,498
l've lost my heart.

183
00:18:46,705 --> 00:18:52,803
l don't know when this happened.

184
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:11,656
Come to me, my darling.

185
00:19:11,797 --> 00:19:13,492
Don't torment me like this.

186
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:17,067
l'll surrender myself
in your arms.

187
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:19,031
Come to me, my darling.

188
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:21,105
Don't torment me like this.

189
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:24,199
l'll surrender myself
in your arms.

190
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:28,312
We'll meet during lonely nights.

191
00:19:29,081 --> 00:19:32,346
We'll talk the night away.

192
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:36,080
Everything seems different.

193
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:40,054
Since my world has changed.

194
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:42,154
Oh my Lord.

195
00:19:42,461 --> 00:19:44,088
l've lost my heart.

196
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:47,822
l've lost contact with
both the worlds.

197
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:49,959
Oh my Lord.

198
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:52,036
l've lost my heart.

199
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:56,434
l don't know when this happened.

200
00:21:07,112 --> 00:21:08,272
Who are you? -PK.

201
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:09,314
Your servant, sir.

202
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,250
Your servant.

203
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:16,914
Who are you?

204
00:21:17,122 --> 00:21:18,680
Your servant, sir.

205
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,289
Your servant.

206
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:38,332
Who..who am l?

207
00:22:03,969 --> 00:22:05,027
Sir.

208
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:45,867
So you really don't remember
anything, sir?

209
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:51,776
Who.. What is my name?

210
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:54,278
Your name..your name is that, sir.
-What's that?

211
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:56,655
Prince. -Your name is Prince, sir.

212
00:22:56,722 --> 00:22:57,620
Prince?

213
00:23:00,092 --> 00:23:01,081
Prince!

214
00:23:03,295 --> 00:23:06,787
This..this house?
-lt's your house, sir.

215
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:09,061
Sir,
you've another house in the city.

216
00:23:09,768 --> 00:23:11,702
You often come here for weekends.

217
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,871
Three days ago you phoned me from
your house in the city..

218
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,964
..and called me there.

219
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:17,675
l'd just reached the
building compound..

220
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:19,768
..when your that arrived.
-What's that?

221
00:23:20,345 --> 00:23:21,369
Your car, sir.

222
00:23:22,114 --> 00:23:23,581
Your arm was bleeding.

223
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:25,273
l asked you how you got hurt.

224
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,510
But you scolded me, sir.

225
00:23:26,885 --> 00:23:28,682
On the way l asked you again..

226
00:23:28,754 --> 00:23:30,949
..whether we should go see a
doctor. --But you scolded again.

227
00:23:31,223 --> 00:23:33,123
Sir, you kept yelling at me all
the way till we came here.

228
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:36,293
And..l hadn't lost my memory then?

229
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:38,287
No sir! You remembered everything.

230
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,593
You said to me, Get that
from the bedroom drawer.

231
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,598
First-aid box!

232
00:23:42,668 --> 00:23:45,660
l got it. l even bandaged you.
-But you fell unconscious.

233
00:23:45,738 --> 00:23:47,262
-And when you regained
consciousness..

234
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:48,465
..you started strangling me.

235
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:51,568
And before l could free myself
and say something..

236
00:23:51,677 --> 00:23:53,702
..you fainted.

237
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:56,770
l couldn't tell you anything
about your condition..

238
00:23:56,849 --> 00:23:58,282
..or the condition of your car.

239
00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:00,275
The condition of my car?

240
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:01,477
lt's in a bad shape, sir.

241
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:03,318
Look..bullet holes.

242
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:04,582
Here..and another one here.

243
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:05,714
Two.

244
00:24:05,824 --> 00:24:09,021
Sir, l feel someone followed
you and tried to kill you.

245
00:24:09,795 --> 00:24:10,887
Sir, between you and me..

246
00:24:10,963 --> 00:24:12,521
..there are only two types of
people who fire bullets.

247
00:24:12,631 --> 00:24:14,496
First are goons,
and second are them.

248
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,692
The police.

249
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:18,434
So, no doctor, no police.
Right, sir?

250
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:21,796
'Sir,
you've another house in the city.'

251
00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:24,371
'Your name..your name is that,
sir. -What's that?'

252
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,768
'Prince.'

253
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:29,343
'Sir, l think someone followed
you and tried to kill you.'

254
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:36,287
Sir,
can l get anything else for you.

255
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:40,516
Fine, sir.

256
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:47,025
PK..what..what do l do?
-You shift things around.

257
00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:49,464
l mean, sir, you work at
an import-export firm.

258
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:51,292
Sir, l've your card as well.

259
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,132
l'll show it to you right now.

260
00:24:53,906 --> 00:24:54,930
Here.

261
00:25:08,153 --> 00:25:10,053
'We're right outside the Wolf
lnternational building.'

262
00:25:10,122 --> 00:25:11,214
'l'm reporting live..'

263
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,723
'..from the headquarters
of Wolf lnternational.'

264
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:14,156
'As you can see behind me..'

265
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:16,222
'..a serious crime has obviously
been committed here.'

266
00:25:16,428 --> 00:25:23,300
'But the police are refusing to
give out any information.'

267
00:25:23,802 --> 00:25:28,068
You said that l've an apartment
in the city.

268
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,076
Yes, sir.
lt's close-by. -Which way?

269
00:25:32,411 --> 00:25:34,174
Left from the high-way.

270
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:35,635
Let's go, sir.

271
00:25:40,052 --> 00:25:42,316
Keep going, sir.
Our building is ahead.

272
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:45,050
Police. -Police?

273
00:25:46,024 --> 00:25:48,288
No, sir. Everyone dressed
in blue isn't the police.

274
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,652
They're in orange jackets.

275
00:25:49,862 --> 00:25:50,794
The municipality.

276
00:25:51,163 --> 00:25:52,562
They must've come to
clear the garbage.

277
00:25:57,035 --> 00:25:58,662
They aren't the police. -Yes.

278
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,135
They're much more dangerous
than the police.

279
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:09,071
Sir..sir, can l go home? -Go.

280
00:26:09,548 --> 00:26:10,572
Thank you, sir.

281
00:26:11,516 --> 00:26:12,540
Wait!

282
00:26:16,154 --> 00:26:19,612
lf l don't come back home
within 24 hours..

283
00:26:20,993 --> 00:26:22,153
..inform the police.

284
00:26:23,228 --> 00:26:24,320
Okay, sir.

285
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:28,492
Who are you?

286
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:30,423
Prince.

287
00:26:33,138 --> 00:26:34,765
These are your MRl scans.

288
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,438
They're all clear.

289
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:44,440
Your nervous system is
in perfect order.

290
00:26:45,384 --> 00:26:49,582
There are no marks of internal
injury in your skull.

291
00:26:50,188 --> 00:26:52,782
All your blood tests are
absolutely clear.

292
00:26:53,392 --> 00:26:54,552
You also remember everything..

293
00:26:54,626 --> 00:26:56,025
..that occurred for
the past two days.

294
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:57,359
Names of people..

295
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:59,896
..addresses, how to drive
a car, how to come here.

296
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:04,600
You can do all daily chores.

297
00:27:05,837 --> 00:27:11,332
Then why did l..suddenly
suffer this memory loss?

298
00:27:12,344 --> 00:27:15,643
The human brain is still a big
mystery to medical science.

299
00:27:16,315 --> 00:27:18,306
Your case is strange, Mr. Prince.

300
00:27:18,817 --> 00:27:21,047
But trust me, l'll try my best.

301
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,817
But it will take time.

302
00:27:23,388 --> 00:27:24,787
You'll have to be patient.

303
00:28:10,602 --> 00:28:11,591
Prince.

304
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,630
l heard that you're very fast.

305
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:19,202
Today l saw it for myself.

306
00:28:19,678 --> 00:28:20,576
l'm impressed.

307
00:28:23,548 --> 00:28:24,515
So am l.

308
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,579
l don't like wasting bullets.

309
00:28:30,989 --> 00:28:32,684
So, it's better you don't
make any smart moves.

310
00:28:35,127 --> 00:28:36,025
Who are you?

311
00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:38,696
And what do you want?

312
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:42,627
You'll soon know what we want.

313
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,094
Now, come on.

314
00:29:46,832 --> 00:29:48,026
Good work, Roy.

315
00:29:49,134 --> 00:29:51,125
And welcome to l-Grip, Prince.

316
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:55,264
lndian Government Research and
lntelligence Portfolio.

317
00:29:58,009 --> 00:30:01,638
You might've never heard
about this unit of ours.

318
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:05,848
You're talking to Colonel Khanna,
Bureau Chief.

319
00:30:08,086 --> 00:30:09,781
Let me come straight to the point,
Prince.

320
00:30:10,522 --> 00:30:12,581
Where is that coin? -Coin?

321
00:30:14,426 --> 00:30:16,860
Which coin?
-The same antique gold coin..

322
00:30:16,962 --> 00:30:18,953
..for which you struck
a deal with..

323
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,793
..Sarang for 500 million rupees.

324
00:30:20,932 --> 00:30:23,025
Yes, we know.

325
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:26,670
There are many ways of extracting
information.

326
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:29,334
So it's better that you
tell us quickly.

327
00:30:30,308 --> 00:30:32,105
Where is that coin?

328
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:38,040
l don't know about any gold coin.

329
00:30:39,317 --> 00:30:40,579
So, you want to act tough?

330
00:30:41,987 --> 00:30:45,889
Now get up, come on.

331
00:30:59,171 --> 00:31:00,297
Start the brain-mapper.

332
00:31:18,256 --> 00:31:19,416
Let's load his memory.

333
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:29,191
Take note of it.

334
00:31:44,683 --> 00:31:46,173
This is unbelievable, Colonel.

335
00:31:46,284 --> 00:31:48,047
He has only a day's memory.

336
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,217
Sir, how can it be possible.

337
00:31:50,522 --> 00:31:51,784
Try once more.

338
00:31:52,123 --> 00:31:53,181
Okay, try once again.

339
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:54,782
Sir, this isn't possible
in medical science.

340
00:31:54,859 --> 00:31:56,349
But you know, Colonel, all the
other information is missing.

341
00:31:56,428 --> 00:31:58,521
And it seems like he has..
-Like, he has..

342
00:31:58,597 --> 00:32:01,498
..used the coin..on himself.

343
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:02,924
Sir, it's not working sir.

344
00:32:03,134 --> 00:32:04,499
l know that. But you keep trying.

345
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:07,497
There are many people who
are after this coin.

346
00:32:07,906 --> 00:32:10,773
We came all the way from
lndia for this coin.

347
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:12,901
lt's very difficult
to hide this coin.

348
00:32:13,144 --> 00:32:14,702
Sir, he has just a day's memory.

349
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:16,107
l know, even l can see that.

350
00:32:16,181 --> 00:32:17,148
But, try once again.

351
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,045
Sir, we should keep a
strict watch on him.

352
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:21,819
Maybe,
he might remember something.

353
00:32:22,654 --> 00:32:25,953
Gradually, when his life and
memory become normal..

354
00:32:26,091 --> 00:32:28,389
Normal? He's Prince, Roy.

355
00:32:29,494 --> 00:32:33,931
His life was never normal,
and it'll never be.

356
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:36,894
Take him.

357
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:48,072
You've lost your memory and
the reason is that coin.

358
00:32:49,147 --> 00:32:51,741
So let me tell you a few
important things.

359
00:32:53,818 --> 00:32:57,447
Sarang wanted to give you 500
million for that coin.

360
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:02,222
You need to remember
just one thing.

361
00:33:03,795 --> 00:33:05,786
You'd that coin in your hands..

362
00:33:07,365 --> 00:33:08,559
..and you'll soon have it again.

363
00:33:09,434 --> 00:33:11,231
Because,
you aren't doing this job alone.

364
00:33:11,336 --> 00:33:12,462
There's someone with you.

365
00:33:13,705 --> 00:33:18,802
Your partner. -Partner?

366
00:33:21,146 --> 00:33:24,604
When your partner contacts you,
you tell him that..

367
00:33:24,716 --> 00:33:28,208
..that coin is worth much
more than you thought.

368
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,754
Sarang was offering you 500.

369
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:32,585
We'll give you 1000.

370
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:35,853
Do you understand?

371
00:33:37,462 --> 00:33:38,952
That coin is like God for you.

372
00:33:39,064 --> 00:33:40,759
And only that can save your life.

373
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:44,660
But you've only four days.

374
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,240
No one can save you
after four days.

375
00:33:50,308 --> 00:33:51,605
Not even God.

376
00:33:55,146 --> 00:33:56,010
Take him.

377
00:34:20,004 --> 00:34:21,266
Candy Club, 9pm.

378
00:34:22,307 --> 00:34:23,205
Maya.

379
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,589
Sir, that's Mr. Sarang.

380
00:34:40,692 --> 00:34:41,590
Your boss.

381
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:51,396
Have you ever felt that l'm
not into import-export.

382
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:55,405
But something illegal?
-Never, sir. Not at all.

383
00:34:55,473 --> 00:34:56,633
You're a very nice man.

384
00:34:56,975 --> 00:34:59,239
Actually,
sir, once l was in need of money.

385
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,870
You gave me double
of what l needed.

386
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:05,712
Do you know of any
girl called Maya?

387
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:08,080
Not any girl,
sir, she's your girlfriend.

388
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,848
She works with you.

389
00:35:10,088 --> 00:35:12,079
ln fact, you also said..

390
00:35:12,223 --> 00:35:13,622
..that you're going to marry her.

391
00:35:16,928 --> 00:35:18,486
Do you've Maya's number?

392
00:35:18,596 --> 00:35:19,790
How can l've her number, sir?

393
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:21,330
lt must be saved in your mobile.

394
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,294
But it was lost that night.

395
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:26,327
Maya.

396
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:48,655
You dwell in my eyes.

397
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:52,693
You inhibit my breath.

398
00:35:56,935 --> 00:36:00,666
All day and all night.

399
00:36:01,005 --> 00:36:04,099
The restless heart says.

400
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:08,040
My heart craves for you baby,
now.

401
00:36:08,313 --> 00:36:12,010
My heart craves for you baby,
now.

402
00:36:12,283 --> 00:36:15,946
My heart craves for you baby,
now.

403
00:36:36,908 --> 00:36:40,309
Let me come closer to you.

404
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:44,207
There are burning desires.

405
00:36:45,049 --> 00:36:51,955
lt's difficult to spend these
restless nights without you.

406
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:56,554
Let me come closer to you.

407
00:36:57,061 --> 00:37:00,861
There are burning desires.

408
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:07,905
lt's difficult to spend these
restless nights without you.

409
00:37:08,606 --> 00:37:12,201
Life and death are meaningless
without you.

410
00:37:12,443 --> 00:37:16,345
My heart..for you baby, now.

411
00:37:16,614 --> 00:37:20,448
My heart..for you baby, now.

412
00:37:20,652 --> 00:37:24,452
My heart..for you baby, now.

413
00:37:24,722 --> 00:37:28,624
My heart craves for you baby,
now.

414
00:37:45,944 --> 00:37:46,911
Excuse me.

415
00:37:47,312 --> 00:37:48,870
ls there a Maya..

416
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,534
Maya. -Prince.

417
00:38:13,271 --> 00:38:14,863
l missed you so much.

418
00:38:17,408 --> 00:38:22,038
l thought..
l thought l'd lost you forever.

419
00:38:24,682 --> 00:38:27,446
Oh, God. l was.. l was so scared.

420
00:38:28,953 --> 00:38:30,181
l was so scared.

421
00:38:32,991 --> 00:38:34,083
How is your arm now?

422
00:38:36,494 --> 00:38:38,519
Are you seeing your Maya
for the first time?

423
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,354
Prince, l'm.. -l am..

424
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:43,493
l'm sorry.

425
00:38:44,769 --> 00:38:48,705
Honestly, l don't recognise you.

426
00:38:50,808 --> 00:38:51,706
Maya.

427
00:38:56,748 --> 00:38:58,010
You've lost your memory.

428
00:39:00,918 --> 00:39:02,146
But not my love.

429
00:39:04,355 --> 00:39:06,118
l'll remind you of our story.

430
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,056
Those beautiful moments
we spent together.

431
00:39:13,631 --> 00:39:16,759
'But, someone jinxed your love.'

432
00:39:17,669 --> 00:39:18,829
'Sarang.'

433
00:39:18,936 --> 00:39:21,803
'The biggest white-collar
criminal of Durban.'

434
00:39:24,642 --> 00:39:26,906
'But you were Sarang's
real power.'

435
00:39:27,712 --> 00:39:28,701
'His number one man.'

436
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:32,514
'Only a few were fated
to play with Sarang.'

437
00:39:33,317 --> 00:39:36,252
'But no one could
win against him.'

438
00:39:39,991 --> 00:39:41,982
'We wanted to start a new life.'

439
00:39:42,827 --> 00:39:45,819
'A life that belonged only to us.'

440
00:39:47,131 --> 00:39:48,621
'And weren't moments
stolen from Sarang.'

441
00:39:50,068 --> 00:39:51,865
'You knew everything
about Sarang.'

442
00:39:53,504 --> 00:39:55,563
'And only death could
separate someone..'

443
00:39:55,973 --> 00:39:57,941
'..from Sarang who knew
so much about him.'

444
00:39:58,676 --> 00:40:00,268
'But you were never
scared of death.'

445
00:40:00,745 --> 00:40:04,681
Maya, l'm going to steal
Sarang's coin. -Coin?

446
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:07,517
Yes, Sarang's coin.

447
00:40:07,585 --> 00:40:08,984
lt was no ordinary coin.

448
00:40:09,353 --> 00:40:12,254
lt was made in Sri Lanka,
3000 years ago.

449
00:40:12,356 --> 00:40:14,119
And it's said that the gold
it was created from..

450
00:40:14,192 --> 00:40:15,887
..came from Ravan's chariot.

451
00:40:17,128 --> 00:40:20,029
And it's also said that
it has magical powers.

452
00:40:20,698 --> 00:40:22,290
You made a plan that after
stealing the coin..

453
00:40:22,366 --> 00:40:24,994
..you'd come home and pick me up.

454
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:29,398
But that night,
when l was waiting for you..

455
00:40:30,374 --> 00:40:31,602
Hello. -Maya.

456
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:33,671
Prince, where are you?

457
00:40:33,745 --> 00:40:35,940
Maya, l've been shot. -What?

458
00:40:36,347 --> 00:40:38,747
Relax, l'll be fine. Listen to me.

459
00:40:39,183 --> 00:40:40,480
l've stolen Sarang's coin.

460
00:40:40,752 --> 00:40:42,151
But his men are following me.

461
00:40:43,187 --> 00:40:44,950
Prince, are you fine?

462
00:40:45,256 --> 00:40:46,348
l'm fine, Maya.

463
00:40:46,758 --> 00:40:47,884
But you aren't safe there.

464
00:40:48,326 --> 00:40:49,486
Get out of there immediately.

465
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:50,887
Go somewhere safe.

466
00:40:51,162 --> 00:40:52,561
l'll contact you later, okay.
-But..

467
00:40:53,164 --> 00:40:55,394
Maya, l love you.

468
00:40:58,102 --> 00:40:59,000
l love you too.

469
00:41:00,104 --> 00:41:01,002
Prince.

470
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:04,768
l couldn't do anything
else but wait.

471
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,010
Forget about Sarang,
his coin and the money.

472
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,340
You know, Ruby knows a bar
owner in Cape Town.

473
00:41:14,285 --> 00:41:15,411
l'll get a job there.

474
00:41:17,188 --> 00:41:18,120
Please.

475
00:41:18,623 --> 00:41:20,318
Please return Sarang his coin.

476
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:22,054
So he can leave us alone.

477
00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:23,992
Right.

478
00:41:24,896 --> 00:41:25,988
l don't have that coin.

479
00:41:28,366 --> 00:41:31,597
You said you've hidden
that coin somewhere.

480
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:34,631
Only the coin can save us
from Sarang, Prince.

481
00:41:35,673 --> 00:41:40,133
l.. l've forgotten everything.

482
00:41:41,646 --> 00:41:43,011
And.. until l find that coin..

483
00:41:44,415 --> 00:41:46,349
..you'll have to stay with Ruby.

484
00:41:47,318 --> 00:41:50,082
There are many people after
me for that coin.

485
00:41:51,756 --> 00:41:52,620
l'm not safe.

486
00:41:54,258 --> 00:41:57,557
l'll contact you myself after
l find the coin, okay?

487
00:41:58,663 --> 00:42:01,359
Okay, but..

488
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:04,466
But,
where will you look for the coin?

489
00:42:08,673 --> 00:42:12,006
'Sarang wanted to give you 500
million for that coin.'

490
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:20,511
'There's someone with you.'

491
00:42:23,754 --> 00:42:25,187
'That coin is like God for you.'

492
00:42:25,323 --> 00:42:26,984
'And only that can
save your life.'

493
00:42:32,363 --> 00:42:34,331
'But you've only four days.'

494
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:36,733
'No one can save you
after four days.'

495
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:37,893
'Not even God.'

496
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,077
Hello, Prince.
This is Maya speaking. -Maya?

497
00:42:48,312 --> 00:42:50,507
Yes, Maya. -But l told you..

498
00:42:50,581 --> 00:42:52,446
Look, meet me immediately
at the boat club.

499
00:42:52,516 --> 00:42:53,483
Are you fine? -Yes.

500
00:42:53,818 --> 00:42:55,410
l'm waiting for you
at pier number 4.

501
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:58,147
Come as soon as possible.
Okay. -Maya! Maya!

502
00:43:03,194 --> 00:43:04,161
Pier number 4?

503
00:43:19,644 --> 00:43:21,407
Prince. Prince.

504
00:43:24,048 --> 00:43:25,106
Thank God you're okay.

505
00:43:25,182 --> 00:43:26,376
l was so worried.

506
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:28,278
How is your arm now?

507
00:43:28,552 --> 00:43:30,383
l've been trying to contact
you for the past two days.

508
00:43:30,454 --> 00:43:32,319
But l couldn't get through
to your mobile.

509
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:34,017
And you didn't contact me either.

510
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:35,422
Finally l spoke to Sarang..

511
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,723
..and have taken 24 hours time.

512
00:43:38,062 --> 00:43:40,530
Anyway, we'll need that much time.
-Who are you?

513
00:43:43,734 --> 00:43:44,962
What's wrong with you, Prince?

514
00:43:48,873 --> 00:43:49,737
l'm Maya.

515
00:43:56,614 --> 00:43:57,672
Prince.. -You aren't Maya.

516
00:43:58,582 --> 00:44:00,573
But you know that l've
lost my memory.

517
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:02,610
And you're trying to take
advantage of it.

518
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,678
Why? Who are you?

519
00:44:05,756 --> 00:44:07,087
What are you saying, Prince?

520
00:44:07,525 --> 00:44:09,322
What's wrong with your memory?

521
00:44:10,294 --> 00:44:11,318
l'm Maya.

522
00:44:12,096 --> 00:44:14,121
CBl officer Maya Malhotra.

523
00:44:14,598 --> 00:44:15,895
You're Maya?

524
00:44:21,472 --> 00:44:22,871
Prince.

525
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:28,139
Prince! What's wrong?

526
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:32,407
Prince!

527
00:44:53,237 --> 00:44:54,135
Your gun.

528
00:44:59,744 --> 00:45:00,711
Your lD.

529
00:45:02,313 --> 00:45:04,042
CBl officer Prince.

530
00:45:06,017 --> 00:45:06,881
CBl?

531
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:11,885
And this is your partner.
l mean, mine.

532
00:45:12,289 --> 00:45:13,722
Officer Maya Malhotra.

533
00:45:14,325 --> 00:45:17,158
We're working with the CBl chief,
officer Khan.

534
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,662
Now do you believe me?

535
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:22,827
These.. these id's could be fake!!

536
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:24,099
Fake?

537
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:27,464
Do you know what this is?

538
00:45:28,973 --> 00:45:30,338
The map of Sarang's house.

539
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:34,939
And this is Sarang's case file..

540
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,770
..lt has all his details.

541
00:45:38,783 --> 00:45:40,512
We came here to get
Sarang arrested.

542
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:43,544
Operation 'Durban Under Cover'.

543
00:45:44,422 --> 00:45:45,912
Stage one,
winning Sarang's trust..

544
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,925
..and working with him.

545
00:45:49,226 --> 00:45:52,423
Stage two,
collecting evidence against him..

546
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:54,930
..and arresting him red-handed.

547
00:45:56,267 --> 00:45:58,531
But it wasn't so easy
to get to Sarang.

548
00:45:58,602 --> 00:46:00,695
Because Sarang is South Africa's..

549
00:46:00,871 --> 00:46:03,339
..biggest white-collar criminal.

550
00:46:03,941 --> 00:46:06,341
And no one can lay a hand on him.

551
00:46:18,155 --> 00:46:19,918
That's why we posed as
thieves ourselves.

552
00:46:20,024 --> 00:46:21,616
And committed three high-profile
robberies.

553
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:26,090
Paris, Jakarta, and the Diamond
Corporation of lndia.

554
00:46:26,764 --> 00:46:30,165
And after that Sarang noticed us.

555
00:46:30,668 --> 00:46:32,431
He contacted us..

556
00:46:32,503 --> 00:46:34,494
..and gave us a proposal
to join him.

557
00:46:38,209 --> 00:46:39,767
Then he gave us the job..

558
00:46:39,844 --> 00:46:42,938
..of stealing an antique coin
from the Cape Town Museum.

559
00:46:43,314 --> 00:46:44,611
Our plan was that..

560
00:46:44,715 --> 00:46:47,616
..after we steal the coin and
deliver it to Sarang..

561
00:46:47,718 --> 00:46:51,313
..Officer Khan would arrest
him red-handed.

562
00:46:52,022 --> 00:46:53,546
The Durban police was after us.

563
00:46:53,924 --> 00:46:56,256
Because they didn't know
that we were undercover.

564
00:46:57,161 --> 00:47:00,096
We parted that day,
and met only today.

565
00:47:01,198 --> 00:47:02,597
We still have a lot left to do,
Prince.

566
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:04,190
And l can't do it alone.
l need you.

567
00:47:05,436 --> 00:47:06,494
One more thing.

568
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:12,507
We aren'tjust partners at CBl.

569
00:47:14,945 --> 00:47:16,071
We're life-partners as well.

570
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,840
Here's the coffee.

571
00:47:20,951 --> 00:47:22,441
Without sugar and milk for sir.

572
00:47:22,553 --> 00:47:24,384
And for madam'am,
sugar and milk are separate.

573
00:47:24,722 --> 00:47:25,689
Right.

574
00:47:28,058 --> 00:47:30,288
You remember everything other
than names, isn't it?

575
00:47:30,895 --> 00:47:32,294
What's in the name, Maya madam?

576
00:47:32,696 --> 00:47:34,288
Thankfully sir met you.

577
00:47:34,698 --> 00:47:37,531
Otherwise, l was going on
answering his questions.

578
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:38,693
Mad. -PK!

579
00:47:39,136 --> 00:47:40,034
Okay, sir.

580
00:47:42,106 --> 00:47:44,074
That foolish servant
of mine says that..

581
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:46,741
..l work for Sarang's company,
Wolf lnternational.

582
00:47:47,244 --> 00:47:49,804
An unknown girl says that..

583
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,674
..Sarang is a gangster and
l'm his right-hand man.

584
00:47:53,217 --> 00:47:54,081
And now you.

585
00:47:54,185 --> 00:47:56,517
You say that l'm an undercover
agent for CBl.

586
00:47:56,587 --> 00:47:58,350
And l was gathering evidence
against Sarang.. -Prince!

587
00:47:58,822 --> 00:48:00,756
Sarang isn't an ordinary gangster.

588
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:02,683
He has offices all over the world.

589
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,322
He operates from Durban.

590
00:48:04,428 --> 00:48:07,226
But he has connections with
international cartels.

591
00:48:08,032 --> 00:48:10,694
l don't know about the lie
that girl has told you.

592
00:48:11,268 --> 00:48:14,863
All l know is that your
life is in danger.

593
00:48:15,206 --> 00:48:19,609
Because Sarang has contacts from
the ministry to the media.

594
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:24,504
Sarang can go to any limits
to wipe out his enemy.

595
00:48:25,015 --> 00:48:27,381
Regardless of what price
he has to pay for it.

596
00:48:30,721 --> 00:48:33,485
Sarang gets everything he wants.

597
00:48:33,624 --> 00:48:36,422
And now his sights
are on that coin.

598
00:48:36,627 --> 00:48:39,061
And it's very important for
us to find it, Prince.

599
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:42,857
You don't know how dangerous
Sarang is.

600
00:49:09,193 --> 00:49:11,457
Any news? -No, sir, nothing yet.

601
00:49:11,996 --> 00:49:13,520
Contact SERENA.

602
00:49:13,864 --> 00:49:16,264
Find out where Prince
and his Maya are.

603
00:49:34,518 --> 00:49:36,179
That girl who was dancing
here yesterday..

604
00:49:36,253 --> 00:49:37,845
..hasn't she come?

605
00:49:39,189 --> 00:49:40,850
There are many such girls
who come here everyday.

606
00:49:42,459 --> 00:49:43,687
Do you know her address?

607
00:49:44,995 --> 00:49:46,792
l don't know her address.

608
00:49:53,837 --> 00:49:54,826
Your drink.

609
00:49:54,905 --> 00:49:55,997
This is my number.

610
00:49:59,109 --> 00:50:00,201
And this is yours.

611
00:50:02,279 --> 00:50:05,214
Call me if you find her address.

612
00:50:12,523 --> 00:50:13,421
Hello.

613
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:14,684
Your lover was here.

614
00:50:16,193 --> 00:50:18,889
He was asking for your address.
-What?

615
00:50:19,897 --> 00:50:21,489
He has offered me 25,000.

616
00:50:22,132 --> 00:50:25,124
Send 50 before the club
closes down. -Okay.

617
00:50:26,437 --> 00:50:29,304
'Hello.
Welcome to News One. l'm Pragya.'

618
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:32,407
Rahul Singh, son of lnfrastructure
Minister Vinod Singh..

619
00:50:32,476 --> 00:50:34,410
'..passed away in a
plane accident.'

620
00:50:34,478 --> 00:50:36,070
'We've learnt from reliable
sources..'

621
00:50:36,246 --> 00:50:39,272
'..that Rahul Singh was testing
his new private jet.' -Sir.

622
00:50:41,452 --> 00:50:43,716
'Rahul Singh's close friend
and business associate..'

623
00:50:43,921 --> 00:50:46,287
'..has expressed his condolences.'
-Mike. -Sorry, sir.

624
00:50:46,423 --> 00:50:49,324
We've still not found out the
reason behind this accident.

625
00:50:54,198 --> 00:50:56,928
For God's sake,
Priya, you know l'm with Sarang.

626
00:50:57,034 --> 00:50:58,001
Shut up, Mike.

627
00:50:58,102 --> 00:50:59,399
This is an emergency, okay.

628
00:51:00,371 --> 00:51:01,303
We're in trouble.

629
00:51:02,206 --> 00:51:04,800
Prince came back to Candy Club.
-Oh, my God.

630
00:51:05,609 --> 00:51:07,406
Why.. why did he come there?

631
00:51:07,845 --> 00:51:09,403
Tomorrow he'll come here
looking for me.

632
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,845
Priya, l'd told you before..
-Send 50,000 today to Tony..

633
00:51:11,915 --> 00:51:14,679
..before the club closes, okay?

634
00:51:15,219 --> 00:51:16,584
Forget the coin, Priya.

635
00:51:17,588 --> 00:51:20,853
lt isn't easy to deceive
Sarang or Prince.

636
00:51:20,924 --> 00:51:25,657
Mike. You know l'm doing
all this for us.

637
00:51:27,898 --> 00:51:28,830
You know l love you.

638
00:52:04,701 --> 00:52:06,168
Come here.

639
00:53:15,038 --> 00:53:20,476
What are you thinking about?
-About the coin.

640
00:53:24,548 --> 00:53:25,845
l've found my Prince.

641
00:53:27,985 --> 00:53:29,475
So Prince will find
his coin as well.

642
00:53:32,623 --> 00:53:33,885
l don't want to leave.

643
00:53:35,926 --> 00:53:37,723
But l need to contact
the department.

644
00:53:42,699 --> 00:53:43,893
They suspect you.

645
00:53:49,873 --> 00:53:51,397
And l need to ask Sarang
for some more time.

646
00:53:55,712 --> 00:53:56,736
But don't worry.

647
00:53:58,382 --> 00:54:01,180
l know,
you'll surely find the coin.

648
00:54:02,986 --> 00:54:03,884
Okay.

649
00:54:09,993 --> 00:54:10,891
Khan.

650
00:54:13,263 --> 00:54:16,596
l didn't know you'd be waiting
here to welcome me.

651
00:54:17,434 --> 00:54:18,560
lt's such a happy occasion.

652
00:54:18,635 --> 00:54:20,125
The CBl was involved
in the coin robbery.

653
00:54:20,203 --> 00:54:21,568
And you didn't tell us that.

654
00:54:22,306 --> 00:54:23,534
Sir, l didn't know that l-GRlP..

655
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,107
..was interested in
the coin as well.

656
00:54:25,175 --> 00:54:27,837
lt's clearly written in
1st August's circular..

657
00:54:27,911 --> 00:54:29,936
..that l-GRlP is the
highest authority.

658
00:54:30,948 --> 00:54:32,108
Higher than CBl.

659
00:54:32,783 --> 00:54:34,683
l'm sorry, sir, but l didn't
read that circular.

660
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,150
What happened in the
coin robbery case?

661
00:54:38,689 --> 00:54:40,657
Maya has located Prince.

662
00:54:41,258 --> 00:54:44,284
And we're almost ready
to nab Sarang.

663
00:54:45,228 --> 00:54:46,957
We don't have anything
to do with Sarang.

664
00:54:48,465 --> 00:54:50,228
We just want the coin, Khan.

665
00:54:50,734 --> 00:54:53,100
At any cost. -Fine, sir.

666
00:54:54,304 --> 00:54:57,501
The coin will be yours.
But Sarang will be ours.

667
00:55:00,277 --> 00:55:01,209
Okay.

668
00:55:03,914 --> 00:55:07,281
You'll have to keep me informed
about whatever you do.

669
00:55:08,452 --> 00:55:11,216
Why just you,
we should inform Sarang as well..

670
00:55:11,688 --> 00:55:13,315
..about the plan we've
hatched to nab him.

671
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:16,452
Actually,
why don't we publish a newspaper?

672
00:55:17,094 --> 00:55:18,152
Times of Crime.

673
00:55:18,695 --> 00:55:20,253
Khan, don't act smart.

674
00:55:20,864 --> 00:55:24,061
Roy, l'm smart.

675
00:55:36,246 --> 00:55:40,808
PK, try to remember.

676
00:55:42,085 --> 00:55:43,609
l want to know.

677
00:55:44,021 --> 00:55:47,047
The other night,
did we stop anywhere?

678
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:50,088
Anywhere? -No,
sir, l've told you so many times.

679
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,094
That night,
once we left from that house..

680
00:55:52,295 --> 00:55:54,695
..we stopped only after we
got here, that's all.

681
00:56:02,773 --> 00:56:03,967
Car.

682
00:59:26,943 --> 00:59:29,878
Hi, baby. -Maya, guess what.

683
00:59:31,147 --> 00:59:32,341
l found the coin.

684
00:59:33,016 --> 00:59:36,144
That's amazing, Prince.
-Yes, l know it's amazing.

685
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,311
Okay,
tell me what we need to do next.

686
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:43,087
Sarang is at his farm house at
the moment, Santa Cabana.

687
00:59:43,159 --> 00:59:45,684
l'll contact him and arrange
for the coin's delivery.

688
00:59:46,363 --> 00:59:48,627
Sarang will come with his men.

689
00:59:48,732 --> 00:59:53,066
And officer Khan will be ready
with his men to nab him.

690
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:55,301
There's a place amidst
the mountains..

691
00:59:55,572 --> 00:59:57,904
..where Sarang can't hide.

692
00:59:58,241 --> 01:00:00,573
lt's called Wild Extreme.

693
01:00:19,162 --> 01:00:20,288
Everything is set.

694
01:00:21,131 --> 01:00:23,031
Khan is reaching with his team.

695
01:00:30,807 --> 01:00:31,933
Where did you find the coin?

696
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:35,468
ln the heel of my shoe.

697
01:00:39,382 --> 01:00:40,576
Sarang.

698
01:01:19,356 --> 01:01:21,517
Prince, my number one man.

699
01:01:22,959 --> 01:01:24,859
l heard that you were shot.

700
01:01:26,563 --> 01:01:27,689
l was worried.

701
01:01:28,898 --> 01:01:32,095
Where's the coin?
-Where's our money?

702
01:01:47,217 --> 01:01:48,309
Coin.

703
01:02:08,405 --> 01:02:09,531
Sarang!

704
01:02:26,189 --> 01:02:27,247
No!

705
01:02:56,786 --> 01:02:57,912
Leave me!

706
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:18,764
There's something wrong, isn't it?

707
01:03:20,743 --> 01:03:23,337
How can everything end so easily,
isn't it?

708
01:03:24,781 --> 01:03:26,942
Yes. Now l remember.

709
01:03:29,486 --> 01:03:31,181
Where's your CBl team, Prince?

710
01:03:32,222 --> 01:03:33,689
They haven't arrived
yet to arrest me.

711
01:03:38,027 --> 01:03:40,018
What was the name of that officer?
-Khan.

712
01:03:45,101 --> 01:03:46,693
CBl officer, Ali Khan.

713
01:03:47,804 --> 01:03:49,396
He hasn't arrived. -PK.

714
01:03:50,206 --> 01:03:51,764
The police should've arrived
on time, sir.

715
01:03:52,175 --> 01:03:53,699
After all,
how long can we criminals wait?

716
01:03:53,843 --> 01:03:54,810
Right, boss.

717
01:03:55,378 --> 01:03:56,811
You've run enough, Prince.

718
01:03:58,348 --> 01:03:59,975
Who will save you now?

719
01:04:00,049 --> 01:04:01,107
Boss, wait.

720
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:03,345
Wait please, this is a fake coin.

721
01:04:03,586 --> 01:04:04,484
lt's a copy.

722
01:04:15,899 --> 01:04:17,992
Give back the gun, Prince.

723
01:04:30,547 --> 01:04:31,809
What are you thinking, darling?

724
01:04:33,783 --> 01:04:36,547
That how can Maya kill you?

725
01:04:40,056 --> 01:04:41,421
But Serena can.

726
01:04:42,425 --> 01:04:43,585
Yes, Serena.

727
01:04:44,928 --> 01:04:46,486
Your Serena.

728
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:48,788
WHO could've done
anything for you.

729
01:04:53,403 --> 01:04:54,665
Give me the real coin, Prince.

730
01:04:55,438 --> 01:04:57,565
Or l'll kill you, l promise.

731
01:04:58,341 --> 01:04:59,740
Where is the real coin?

732
01:05:20,563 --> 01:05:21,621
Sarang.

733
01:05:39,182 --> 01:05:40,308
Come on, move.

734
01:05:59,569 --> 01:06:00,661
Watch out!

735
01:06:21,791 --> 01:06:23,520
Get them, l want them alive.

736
01:06:23,626 --> 01:06:25,025
l want them alive.

737
01:06:26,996 --> 01:06:28,122
Move, move

738
01:06:28,264 --> 01:06:29,492
Get into the car, quick.

739
01:07:08,338 --> 01:07:09,498
Overtake him, catch them.

740
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:18,971
Come on, Prince, you can do it.

741
01:08:20,009 --> 01:08:21,033
lt's show time.

742
01:09:26,242 --> 01:09:27,174
Who are you?

743
01:09:27,443 --> 01:09:28,740
Maya.

744
01:09:31,781 --> 01:09:33,180
Another Maya.

745
01:09:33,816 --> 01:09:35,044
Another story.

746
01:09:36,085 --> 01:09:39,782
So, what do you've to say?

747
01:09:40,323 --> 01:09:46,319
All l want to say,
Prince, is that l love you.

748
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:49,327
More than my life.

749
01:09:50,266 --> 01:09:52,461
l won't tell you any story.

750
01:09:53,302 --> 01:09:54,769
l'll tell you the truth.

751
01:09:55,771 --> 01:09:57,762
Neither are you Sarang's
right hand..

752
01:09:58,174 --> 01:10:00,165
..nor are you a CBl officer.

753
01:10:00,843 --> 01:10:02,936
You and l are professional
thieves.

754
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:06,707
We've been working with
Sarang for many years.

755
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:08,175
The same old story.

756
01:10:09,685 --> 01:10:12,586
New twist. lnteresting.

757
01:10:14,724 --> 01:10:16,021
Go on.

758
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:21,826
Few months ago we decided that
we'll leave this profession.

759
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:24,564
And settle down.

760
01:10:25,501 --> 01:10:29,835
But..it was very difficult
to do that.

761
01:10:30,506 --> 01:10:33,475
Sarang's organization
is a one way street.

762
01:10:34,076 --> 01:10:36,067
And there's no u-turn.

763
01:10:38,381 --> 01:10:40,781
We'd only two options.

764
01:10:42,451 --> 01:10:44,146
Either we kill Sarang.

765
01:10:45,354 --> 01:10:47,686
Or..get him arrested.

766
01:10:48,391 --> 01:10:49,949
We chose the second option.

767
01:10:51,861 --> 01:10:54,193
We contacted CBl Officer Khan.

768
01:10:55,631 --> 01:10:56,893
We offered him a deal..

769
01:10:56,999 --> 01:10:59,058
..that we can get Sarang arrested.

770
01:10:59,835 --> 01:11:04,534
But in return we want all our past
criminal records wiped out.

771
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:07,603
Khan agreed.

772
01:11:08,578 --> 01:11:11,547
A few days later Sarang
gave us a job..

773
01:11:11,614 --> 01:11:14,014
..of stealing an antique
gold coin.

774
01:11:14,717 --> 01:11:17,777
We got the opportunity
we were waiting for.

775
01:11:18,354 --> 01:11:20,618
Attention all units,
the package is moving.

776
01:11:20,823 --> 01:11:23,621
Be alert, l repeat, be alert.
-Copy that.

777
01:11:23,859 --> 01:11:27,056
Send a request clearance
at West and Aliwell.

778
01:11:27,163 --> 01:11:28,255
The plan was that..

779
01:11:28,364 --> 01:11:31,800
..when we deliver the coin to
Sarang after stealing it.

780
01:11:32,301 --> 01:11:35,202
..then Officer Khan would
arrest him red-handed.

781
01:11:35,538 --> 01:11:37,335
The plan was foolproof..

782
01:11:37,406 --> 01:11:38,805
..as well as difficult.

783
01:11:41,978 --> 01:11:43,377
Eagle team to Alpha team.

784
01:11:43,746 --> 01:11:45,008
All seems clear up here.

785
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:55,582
Unknown elements on the bridge.

786
01:11:55,858 --> 01:11:58,349
Eagle team to Alpha team.
Unknown elements on the bridge.

787
01:11:58,628 --> 01:12:00,994
Copy that.
All ground units full alert.

788
01:12:01,263 --> 01:12:02,628
l repeat full alert.

789
01:12:06,802 --> 01:12:07,860
Hold the convoy.

790
01:12:08,037 --> 01:12:08,935
Hold the convoy.

791
01:12:09,071 --> 01:12:10,800
Alpha team, clear the bridge now.

792
01:12:11,173 --> 01:12:12,265
Move out! Move out!

793
01:12:12,408 --> 01:12:13,568
Move! Move! Move!

794
01:12:14,844 --> 01:12:17,642
Hey you, put your hands up
in the air right now.

795
01:12:17,713 --> 01:12:19,305
Leader to Eagle One and Two.

796
01:12:19,382 --> 01:12:21,009
Take position. Take position.

797
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:22,617
Eagle One coming into position.

798
01:12:25,621 --> 01:12:27,213
Eagle Two coming into position.

799
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:28,516
l've a clear shot.

800
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:31,952
All units move up.

801
01:12:32,094 --> 01:12:33,391
Blue team, stay with the package.

802
01:12:33,596 --> 01:12:34,858
l repeat, stay with the package.

803
01:12:34,964 --> 01:12:36,158
-Put your hands up in the air.

804
01:12:36,365 --> 01:12:37,525
This is your final warning.

805
01:12:38,601 --> 01:12:39,625
lt's a hologram.

806
01:12:39,902 --> 01:12:41,199
Code red! Code red!

807
01:12:50,546 --> 01:12:52,070
Eagle One and Two do
you see anything?

808
01:12:52,715 --> 01:12:55,013
Speed boat approaching,
look down, under the bridge.

809
01:12:55,451 --> 01:12:56,816
Copy that, take position.

810
01:12:57,086 --> 01:12:58,553
Go! Go! Go! Go! -Move left!

811
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:05,755
Move! Move! Move! Take position!

812
01:13:26,348 --> 01:13:28,145
The package is down!
The package is down!

813
01:13:28,217 --> 01:13:30,151
They're getting away.
Fire at will.

814
01:13:56,912 --> 01:13:59,540
Eagle one, do you've a visual?
-Negative! Negative!

815
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,578
Do you see anything?

816
01:14:13,996 --> 01:14:15,395
'We were successful.'

817
01:14:15,564 --> 01:14:18,032
'But we didn't know
that the coin and..

818
01:14:18,234 --> 01:14:21,635
..robbery will change
our lives forever.'

819
01:14:26,308 --> 01:14:27,206
Go on.

820
01:14:27,276 --> 01:14:29,210
l won't tell you anything else,
Prince.

821
01:14:30,312 --> 01:14:33,907
CBl Officer Khan will tell
you the rest of the story.

822
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:49,595
You should've let me kill him,
Sarang.

823
01:14:49,799 --> 01:14:51,027
Why did you stop me?

824
01:14:52,401 --> 01:14:55,529
Serena, don't make it
personal..ever again.

825
01:14:56,605 --> 01:14:58,630
Until we don't find
the real coin..

826
01:14:58,741 --> 01:15:00,470
..he has to stay alive.

827
01:15:00,843 --> 01:15:02,538
He'll to die.

828
01:15:03,145 --> 01:15:04,612
You've loved him for two years.

829
01:15:05,114 --> 01:15:06,741
So hate him for a few days.

830
01:15:07,116 --> 01:15:10,517
You've just heard him sigh.

831
01:15:11,253 --> 01:15:13,847
He still has to bear
a lot of pain .

832
01:15:14,156 --> 01:15:16,351
Lose a lot of blood.

833
01:15:29,104 --> 01:15:30,867
Okay, Charlie, let's discuss
this in private.

834
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,031
Let's discuss this in the
common room. -Okay.

835
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:39,106
Hello, Prince.

836
01:15:42,451 --> 01:15:45,045
l feel l'll have to introduce
myself again.

837
01:15:45,621 --> 01:15:47,452
Khan, Ali Khan.

838
01:15:52,228 --> 01:15:53,855
Actually, we're very old enemies..

839
01:15:53,996 --> 01:15:55,987
..or shall l say friends.

840
01:15:58,033 --> 01:16:00,627
But this isn't the time
to rake up the past.

841
01:16:03,038 --> 01:16:04,335
Seeing your condition
l'm assured..

842
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:07,866
..that Sarang has used
the coin on you.

843
01:16:13,816 --> 01:16:14,714
Just one question.

844
01:16:17,753 --> 01:16:19,220
What the bloody hell is this coin?

845
01:16:20,522 --> 01:16:22,547
l'll tell you. Come.

846
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:25,251
Lights.

847
01:16:29,265 --> 01:16:31,358
The biography of this coin
starts from here.

848
01:16:32,401 --> 01:16:35,529
Date, 24th August, 2001 .

849
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:39,472
Place, Gwalior's Defence
Research Laboratory.

850
01:16:40,609 --> 01:16:43,942
Characters, a team of chosen
scientists from the country..

851
01:16:44,613 --> 01:16:47,639
..who were secretly carrying out
research on Nano technology.

852
01:16:47,783 --> 01:16:50,752
And the most proficient amongst
them was him, Mr. Ram.

853
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:54,912
After 8 years, Mr. Ram attained
success in his mission.

854
01:16:55,557 --> 01:16:56,854
The mission belonged
to the l-GRlP.

855
01:16:57,826 --> 01:16:59,953
l-GRlP had spent millions on it.

856
01:17:00,996 --> 01:17:02,293
What was Mr. Ram working on?

857
01:17:02,665 --> 01:17:05,327
Mr. Ram was making a path
breaking memory chip.

858
01:17:06,302 --> 01:17:08,065
Through this chip human memory..

859
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:10,297
..can be extracted on
a computer disk.

860
01:17:11,206 --> 01:17:14,471
lt can be altered and
re-implanted in human brain again.

861
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:16,702
Putting it in simple terms..

862
01:17:17,112 --> 01:17:18,409
..it means that through
this chip..

863
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,540
..you can change a man's thinking.

864
01:17:22,184 --> 01:17:24,618
The memory of enemies
can be altered..

865
01:17:24,887 --> 01:17:26,855
..and compel him to believe that..

866
01:17:27,089 --> 01:17:29,523
..he's our friend and not enemy.

867
01:17:29,825 --> 01:17:31,759
The memory of a super
intelligent person..

868
01:17:31,827 --> 01:17:33,624
..can be implanted into thousands
of other people..

869
01:17:33,729 --> 01:17:36,027
..and they all can be made
super-intelligent.

870
01:17:36,165 --> 01:17:37,996
A criminal's memory
can be altered..

871
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,567
..and he can be turned
into a nice man.

872
01:17:40,035 --> 01:17:41,468
The possibilities were immense.

873
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:43,663
And also for the country's
defense.

874
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:50,376
How..how can that happen?
-lt has happened, Prince.

875
01:17:51,347 --> 01:17:52,279
With you.

876
01:17:54,516 --> 01:17:55,847
Two weeks ago when Mr. Ram..

877
01:17:55,918 --> 01:17:58,614
..was to make a presentation
of this chip to l-GRlP..

878
01:17:59,355 --> 01:18:01,949
..but instead his dead
body was found.

879
01:18:02,558 --> 01:18:04,321
And the chip and its software
were missing.

880
01:18:05,561 --> 01:18:07,256
According to the team's
investigation..

881
01:18:07,663 --> 01:18:09,153
..this was the job
of his assistant.

882
01:18:09,698 --> 01:18:11,666
He stole the chip and had
fled to South Africa.

883
01:18:12,668 --> 01:18:14,602
l-GRlP's intelligence found out..

884
01:18:15,704 --> 01:18:19,697
..that he has struck a deal
with someone called Sherry.

885
01:18:19,975 --> 01:18:21,772
Sherry is a famous
antique dealer..

886
01:18:21,877 --> 01:18:23,242
..who operates from Cape Town.

887
01:18:24,613 --> 01:18:26,240
And Sarang's biggest
rival as well.

888
01:18:27,483 --> 01:18:30,316
He deals in defence secrets
and arms-smuggling.

889
01:18:30,886 --> 01:18:32,979
Sherry knew what this
chip was worth.

890
01:18:33,088 --> 01:18:34,680
He sent word to his international
buyers..

891
01:18:34,757 --> 01:18:36,349
..about this chip.

892
01:18:36,592 --> 01:18:39,527
And made an intelligent
plan to sell it.

893
01:18:39,595 --> 01:18:40,892
Sherry would often sell
defence secrets..

894
01:18:40,963 --> 01:18:41,861
..covertly in his priceless
antiques..

895
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:44,160
..through auctions in Durban.

896
01:18:44,733 --> 01:18:49,568
And that's why he.. -He hid this
chip in a antique coin.

897
01:18:49,638 --> 01:18:50,570
Exactly.

898
01:18:51,073 --> 01:18:53,200
The plan was that chip
was to be sold..

899
01:18:53,409 --> 01:18:55,934
..in Durban's auction.

900
01:18:56,178 --> 01:18:57,509
So that the deal is official and..

901
01:18:57,579 --> 01:19:00,514
..the buyers can easily take
the chip out of the country.

902
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:04,417
Sherry arranged to send the coin..

903
01:19:04,486 --> 01:19:05,714
..from Cape Town to Durban along
with his other antiques..

904
01:19:05,788 --> 01:19:08,552
..under the protection
of the local police.

905
01:19:08,924 --> 01:19:10,653
Sherry's plan was good..

906
01:19:10,893 --> 01:19:15,489
..but he didn't have one thing
which his biggest rival had.

907
01:19:19,234 --> 01:19:20,326
You two.

908
01:19:20,769 --> 01:19:24,261
The most cunning and professional
thieves in the world.

909
01:19:25,274 --> 01:19:26,673
When we stole the coin
we didn't know..

910
01:19:26,742 --> 01:19:29,006
..what was inside it.

911
01:19:30,646 --> 01:19:31,772
The coin was in our hands..

912
01:19:32,581 --> 01:19:36,779
..and Serena was standing
before us.

913
01:19:38,554 --> 01:19:40,488
Either Sarang grew
suspicious of us..

914
01:19:40,956 --> 01:19:43,390
..or he didn't want to take
any chance with the coin.

915
01:19:43,992 --> 01:19:45,050
That was the reason..

916
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,794
..why we couldn't contact
Officer Khan.

917
01:19:49,164 --> 01:19:53,794
We didn't know that fate will
play a cruel game with us..

918
01:19:54,536 --> 01:20:00,475
..that will change our past,
present and our future.

919
01:20:02,478 --> 01:20:06,608
You should only play the
games you can win.

920
01:20:09,585 --> 01:20:10,677
Whatever the game..

921
01:20:11,587 --> 01:20:12,747
..you should know how to win.

922
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:27,494
Let's shake hands.

923
01:20:29,571 --> 01:20:33,598
The coin is in my hand,
the cash is in yours.

924
01:20:39,648 --> 01:20:42,742
At the moment,
everything is in my hands.

925
01:20:45,921 --> 01:20:46,979
Coin.

926
01:21:06,308 --> 01:21:09,539
Prince, my number one man.

927
01:21:12,114 --> 01:21:14,105
What deal has officer
Khan offered you..

928
01:21:14,183 --> 01:21:15,309
..to get me arrested?

929
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:21,054
l want to shoot you right now.

930
01:21:22,558 --> 01:21:24,253
But when a weapon becomes rusty..

931
01:21:24,893 --> 01:21:29,330
..we don't break the weapon,
we clean it.

932
01:21:30,365 --> 01:21:32,094
You've done a greatjob for me,
Prince..

933
01:21:32,968 --> 01:21:34,128
..by stealing this chip.

934
01:21:36,505 --> 01:21:37,597
You know what this chip is?

935
01:21:39,041 --> 01:21:42,602
l can make the entire world bow
at my feet with this chip.

936
01:21:42,711 --> 01:21:44,941
l can rewrite lives with it.

937
01:21:45,347 --> 01:21:46,405
Starting with you.

938
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:48,508
Mike.

939
01:22:02,998 --> 01:22:05,523
Today l'll clear the
rust in your head.

940
01:22:06,902 --> 01:22:09,894
Erase all of Maya's memory
from his mind.

941
01:22:11,373 --> 01:22:13,136
Don't leave anything, Mike.

942
01:22:14,509 --> 01:22:19,845
l want a Prince that lives
only for Sarang.

943
01:22:21,149 --> 01:22:23,743
Every step he takes is for me!

944
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:28,283
l want Prince..my number one man,.

945
01:22:42,938 --> 01:22:43,996
Mike, don't!

946
01:22:45,307 --> 01:22:47,775
Don't do this,
Sarang, you'll regret it.

947
01:22:49,211 --> 01:22:50,269
Relax, Maya.

948
01:22:50,912 --> 01:22:55,815
lt's my turn to say to
you lts show time.

949
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,982
We..we're ready, sir.

950
01:23:33,755 --> 01:23:34,813
Take a look, Maya.

951
01:23:35,223 --> 01:23:38,920
Prince has lost all
memories of you.

952
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:43,621
Next time when he wakes up..

953
01:23:45,167 --> 01:23:50,161
..you won't be part of his
memory or his world.

954
01:23:57,713 --> 01:23:58,907
Stop!

955
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:00,174
Nobody moves.

956
01:24:00,816 --> 01:24:02,283
Give me the chip, Prince.

957
01:24:03,318 --> 01:24:05,343
You're making a big mistake.

958
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:07,217
You're making the mistake, Sarang.

959
01:24:09,091 --> 01:24:10,058
Maya was right.

960
01:24:11,059 --> 01:24:12,219
You'll regret it.

961
01:25:21,997 --> 01:25:23,294
Move.

962
01:25:30,305 --> 01:25:31,363
Come on, move ahead.

963
01:26:02,637 --> 01:26:03,831
Move ahead.

964
01:26:09,077 --> 01:26:10,339
Keep moving. Keep moving.

965
01:26:15,217 --> 01:26:16,309
Go.

966
01:26:29,865 --> 01:26:31,127
No!

967
01:26:40,375 --> 01:26:41,842
Prince!

968
01:26:55,056 --> 01:26:56,523
Before we separated..

969
01:26:56,791 --> 01:26:59,954
..we'd decided that we'll
meet at the beach house.

970
01:27:01,763 --> 01:27:03,754
But when l reached
there l saw that..

971
01:27:04,232 --> 01:27:06,223
..P.K was already there.

972
01:27:07,235 --> 01:27:09,829
l understood that Sarang has
still not found the coin.

973
01:27:11,106 --> 01:27:12,801
They were still looking
for that coin.

974
01:27:13,608 --> 01:27:14,870
l kept observing you slyly..

975
01:27:14,976 --> 01:27:18,343
..so that you aren't in
danger from Sarang.

976
01:27:19,047 --> 01:27:22,073
And waited for the right
moment to contact you.

977
01:27:23,451 --> 01:27:26,386
That means l remembered
everything..

978
01:27:26,454 --> 01:27:29,514
..even after we separated.

979
01:27:30,759 --> 01:27:34,627
But..Mike had erased my memory
with the help of that chip.

980
01:27:35,230 --> 01:27:38,063
Just like after deleting software
from a computer..

981
01:27:39,034 --> 01:27:42,868
..we need to restart the computer
to clear all the traces.

982
01:27:44,072 --> 01:27:44,970
Similarly..

983
01:27:45,907 --> 01:27:49,172
..you'd an image of your memory
in your brain at that time.

984
01:27:49,544 --> 01:27:52,570
When you slept at night and
woke up in the morning..

985
01:27:54,783 --> 01:27:57,013
..all the images were cleared.

986
01:27:57,519 --> 01:27:59,350
lts notjust the question
of that coin any longer..

987
01:27:59,821 --> 01:28:01,789
..its also concerns the national
security now, Prince.

988
01:28:01,856 --> 01:28:03,585
And now you're a part
of it as well.

989
01:28:08,763 --> 01:28:11,561
Do you think he has met Khan?

990
01:28:13,368 --> 01:28:15,063
l know he has met Khan.

991
01:28:17,572 --> 01:28:19,802
Then he must've found
out everything.

992
01:28:22,143 --> 01:28:23,405
lf he knew everything..

993
01:28:23,478 --> 01:28:25,241
..he would've come running to me.

994
01:28:27,749 --> 01:28:29,444
Because if he doesn't
come see me..

995
01:28:30,185 --> 01:28:34,485
..then tomorrow will be
Prince's the last day.

996
01:28:44,699 --> 01:28:46,030
Prince.

997
01:28:47,202 --> 01:28:49,500
There's something l didn't
tell Officer Khan.

998
01:28:51,072 --> 01:28:54,064
That day you sent me a voice mail.

999
01:28:58,580 --> 01:29:00,275
Maya. l'm safe.

1000
01:29:00,782 --> 01:29:01,942
l've hidden the coin.

1001
01:29:02,417 --> 01:29:03,941
Gandhiji's looking after it.

1002
01:29:04,185 --> 01:29:06,380
Maya, remember the letters.

1003
01:29:06,454 --> 01:29:09,184
But.. what does it mean?

1004
01:29:12,994 --> 01:29:16,430
l sent this message
from some landline.

1005
01:29:17,599 --> 01:29:19,123
lt must be a payphone.

1006
01:29:20,201 --> 01:29:21,225
We should track it down.

1007
01:29:21,302 --> 01:29:22,701
l've already tracked it down.

1008
01:29:23,071 --> 01:29:24,868
This phone booth is
on Osborne Road.

1009
01:29:25,573 --> 01:29:26,597
Let's go.

1010
01:29:43,658 --> 01:29:46,650
Maya, in the message l said..

1011
01:29:48,396 --> 01:29:50,489
..l've handed over the
coin to Gandhiji.

1012
01:29:52,233 --> 01:29:54,030
Nelson Mandela is considered..

1013
01:29:54,102 --> 01:29:56,093
..the Mahatma Gandhi
of South Africa.

1014
01:29:56,671 --> 01:29:57,899
Right?

1015
01:29:58,707 --> 01:30:00,174
Maybe the coin is inside this.

1016
01:30:01,376 --> 01:30:04,436
Okay, l suggest that you
go out and keep a watch.

1017
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:06,508
l'll open this.

1018
01:30:24,666 --> 01:30:25,758
The coin isn't in these.

1019
01:30:34,209 --> 01:30:35,642
This is our arms room.

1020
01:30:36,544 --> 01:30:39,411
And this is where we've planned
all our high-tech robberies.

1021
01:30:40,782 --> 01:30:43,046
Thank God you didn't
tell P.K about this.

1022
01:30:49,591 --> 01:30:52,424
Prince. That's no ordinary lC.

1023
01:30:54,129 --> 01:30:56,029
They're high-power
tracking devices.

1024
01:30:59,467 --> 01:31:03,096
And this is the.. receiver.

1025
01:31:10,945 --> 01:31:13,072
Come on, move.
-Jack, check in the kitchen.

1026
01:31:13,181 --> 01:31:14,239
One guy go inside.

1027
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:20,487
Yes. -Boss, you were right.

1028
01:31:20,989 --> 01:31:22,479
Maya and Prince were coming here.

1029
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:24,615
We followed them as well, but..
-But you lost them.

1030
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:26,058
Right, boss.

1031
01:31:26,127 --> 01:31:28,095
lf you don't find
them by morning..

1032
01:31:28,730 --> 01:31:30,288
..then you'll be missing as well.

1033
01:31:33,067 --> 01:31:34,466
Come on, guys, let's go find them.

1034
01:31:34,602 --> 01:31:35,660
Come on, move it.

1035
01:31:43,878 --> 01:31:48,110
There's a small thing hidden
in this big city.

1036
01:31:49,484 --> 01:31:50,644
And everyone's after it.

1037
01:31:54,055 --> 01:31:56,216
You'll.. find it.

1038
01:31:57,225 --> 01:31:58,123
Okay.

1039
01:32:00,728 --> 01:32:03,720
What does this coin look like?

1040
01:32:04,666 --> 01:32:05,633
How does it look?

1041
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,059
Just like the fake one.

1042
01:32:08,570 --> 01:32:11,801
Which you gave Sarang. -Right.

1043
01:32:15,443 --> 01:32:19,243
But, why did l hide that
fake coin in my shoes?

1044
01:32:19,681 --> 01:32:21,012
Not you, l did.

1045
01:32:21,783 --> 01:32:23,410
l kept that fake coin there.

1046
01:32:25,186 --> 01:32:26,244
You?

1047
01:32:26,888 --> 01:32:29,288
Serena had weaved her web
of deceit all around you!

1048
01:32:30,458 --> 01:32:32,426
You believed that she was Maya.

1049
01:32:33,394 --> 01:32:35,453
You would've have never
believed me..

1050
01:32:36,497 --> 01:32:38,590
..if l'd contacted you
at that moment.

1051
01:32:39,767 --> 01:32:42,429
That's why l hid that fake
coin in your shoe.

1052
01:32:45,273 --> 01:32:46,831
But it was late.

1053
01:32:49,377 --> 01:32:50,674
Too late.

1054
01:33:08,630 --> 01:33:09,858
l promise you, Maya.

1055
01:33:12,367 --> 01:33:13,800
l'll find that coin.

1056
01:33:16,971 --> 01:33:17,869
For you.

1057
01:33:20,074 --> 01:33:21,234
Good morning, Prince.

1058
01:33:32,186 --> 01:33:33,619
Don't be so surprised.

1059
01:33:35,423 --> 01:33:38,915
l was waiting for you to get up.

1060
01:33:39,394 --> 01:33:40,418
How do you say this?

1061
01:33:40,795 --> 01:33:41,727
Life is too short.

1062
01:33:42,397 --> 01:33:45,264
You must know everything about
the brain-mapper now.

1063
01:33:45,867 --> 01:33:46,856
Everything.

1064
01:33:47,602 --> 01:33:49,627
But there's one defect
that still remains.

1065
01:33:50,004 --> 01:33:51,494
And the effect of that defect is..

1066
01:33:51,773 --> 01:33:54,071
..that your memory
is erased each..

1067
01:33:54,175 --> 01:33:56,541
..time you wake up
from your sleep.

1068
01:33:58,046 --> 01:33:59,570
And the symptoms of this
memory erasure are..

1069
01:33:59,647 --> 01:34:02,741
..nausea,
temporary blindness and headache.

1070
01:34:03,017 --> 01:34:05,850
And if your memory isn't
reloaded in your brain..

1071
01:34:06,354 --> 01:34:08,788
..then your brain will keep
crashing like this.

1072
01:34:09,424 --> 01:34:11,551
lt can lead to brain hemorrhage.

1073
01:34:11,626 --> 01:34:12,684
Sudden death.

1074
01:34:12,927 --> 01:34:15,418
ln this condition you could
live for six days.

1075
01:34:15,964 --> 01:34:17,261
Today is the sixth day.

1076
01:34:17,565 --> 01:34:20,659
ln fact,
you've only eight hours left now.

1077
01:34:22,437 --> 01:34:23,404
Find the coin..

1078
01:34:23,571 --> 01:34:25,402
And take your memory back from me.

1079
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:27,936
l'll not kill you, Prince,

1080
01:34:28,810 --> 01:34:30,107
Just give me the coin.

1081
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:39,113
Prince. l don't you want to die.

1082
01:34:40,421 --> 01:34:43,652
At least,
you not without your memories.

1083
01:34:58,072 --> 01:34:59,403
What are you doing, Prince?

1084
01:35:01,676 --> 01:35:03,735
Mahatma Gandhi Post Office.

1085
01:35:04,679 --> 01:35:05,668
Osborne Road.

Maya, l think this could be it.

Every locker has six numbers.

Ghandhiji's looking after it.

01:35:49,857 --> 01:35:52,417
And Remembers the letters.

01:41:28,629 --> 01:41:29,596
Prince.

1155
01:41:33,801 --> 01:41:34,825
Sweet.

1156
01:41:37,605 --> 01:41:39,197
The road ends here, Prince.

1157
01:41:43,144 --> 01:41:46,545
The coin, please.

1158
01:42:08,035 --> 01:42:09,002
Prince.

1159
01:42:09,336 --> 01:42:11,065
Prince. Prince. Prince.

1160
01:42:11,639 --> 01:42:13,368
Sarang did a terrible
thing with you.

1161
01:42:13,741 --> 01:42:17,472
lf it had been me.. lt would've
been far worse for you.

1162
01:42:21,715 --> 01:42:23,410
Sherry. -Good.

1163
01:42:24,618 --> 01:42:26,916
Now l don't have to
tell Prince that..

1164
01:42:27,021 --> 01:42:29,615
..you stole that coin from me.

1165
01:42:30,825 --> 01:42:32,986
Come on, Prince, be a good boy.

1166
01:42:33,894 --> 01:42:35,623
And give me my coin back.

1167
01:42:37,998 --> 01:42:42,401
One arrow and two targets.

1168
01:42:44,438 --> 01:42:45,496
Maya.

1169
01:42:47,241 --> 01:42:48,299
Guys, get ready.

1170
01:43:20,674 --> 01:43:21,732
Maya!

1171
01:43:22,042 --> 01:43:23,168
Maya!

1172
01:43:24,812 --> 01:43:26,439
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1173
01:44:07,721 --> 01:44:08,745
Come on, move.

1174
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:11,581
Come on, hurry up.

1175
01:44:56,103 --> 01:44:58,094
Hurry up, come on, move, move.

1176
01:47:46,273 --> 01:47:47,365
No!

1177
01:47:48,408 --> 01:47:49,466
Prince!

1178
01:48:34,087 --> 01:48:35,179
Darn.

1179
01:49:03,717 --> 01:49:05,685
Bloody hell. -What happened?

1180
01:49:06,086 --> 01:49:07,246
He doesn't have the coin.

1181
01:49:08,655 --> 01:49:10,748
We didn't find the coin and
abducted Prince as well.

1182
01:49:12,192 --> 01:49:13,454
lf he doesn't have the coin..

1183
01:49:14,194 --> 01:49:15,456
..then Maya must have it.

1184
01:49:15,929 --> 01:49:18,898
And Maya will give us the
coin to save her Prince.

1185
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:21,591
Yes, she'll give the coin.

1186
01:49:21,768 --> 01:49:23,861
And one day, she and Prince
together will kill us.

1187
01:49:25,505 --> 01:49:26,563
Will you shut up?

1188
01:49:27,107 --> 01:49:29,371
Sherry was going to pay us
100 million for that coin.

1189
01:49:29,476 --> 01:49:31,307
Sherry. Sherry is dead. -So what?

1190
01:49:31,411 --> 01:49:32,503
Now Sarang will pay us.

1191
01:49:54,468 --> 01:49:57,835
Serena, where are they?
-They fled.

1192
01:49:58,272 --> 01:49:59,330
Let's go.

1193
01:50:08,649 --> 01:50:09,946
Mike.

1194
01:50:10,617 --> 01:50:11,584
Hello, Mike.

1195
01:50:11,718 --> 01:50:15,347
No, Priya. l know you've the coin.

1196
01:50:15,989 --> 01:50:17,547
But before you go to Sarang..

1197
01:50:18,258 --> 01:50:21,159
..you'll have to come to me.

1198
01:50:21,261 --> 01:50:22,558
Sarang has the brain-mapper.

1199
01:50:22,729 --> 01:50:24,720
What do you've? -Me?

1200
01:50:26,900 --> 01:50:28,333
l've Prince.

1201
01:50:39,179 --> 01:50:40,168
Maya, where are you?

1202
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:42,510
Officer Khan,
l've found their location.

1203
01:50:43,283 --> 01:50:44,477
Maya, we need the coin.

1204
01:50:44,551 --> 01:50:45,677
You'll get it.

1205
01:50:45,752 --> 01:50:47,117
But first l need to save Prince.

1206
01:50:47,921 --> 01:50:50,253
The location is.. -Just a second.

1207
01:50:50,657 --> 01:50:52,648
Okay. -Yes, tell me.

1208
01:50:52,726 --> 01:50:54,353
Ushaka Sea World. Sea Point.

1209
01:50:54,461 --> 01:50:55,519
Two of them.

1210
01:50:55,595 --> 01:50:57,119
Okay,
Maya, we'll be there in a while.

1211
01:50:57,331 --> 01:50:58,457
You just hold fort, okay.

1212
01:51:00,133 --> 01:51:02,397
Found them. Let's go.

1213
01:51:37,037 --> 01:51:39,471
The coin. And your gun.

1214
01:51:39,906 --> 01:51:43,000
First tell me how you can
save Prince's life?

1215
01:51:43,377 --> 01:51:45,402
l've a copy of the brain-mapper
software.

1216
01:51:45,612 --> 01:51:47,807
Which l took from Sarang's laptop.

1217
01:51:47,948 --> 01:51:49,677
lt's the question
of Prince's life.

1218
01:51:51,551 --> 01:51:52,677
How can l trust you?

1219
01:51:52,753 --> 01:51:54,345
You've to, Maya. You've to.

1220
01:51:54,621 --> 01:51:56,350
Sarang wanted to kill Prince..

1221
01:51:56,423 --> 01:51:57,890
..as soon as he got the coin.

1222
01:51:58,492 --> 01:52:00,858
l made this copy to
save Prince's life.

1223
01:52:01,661 --> 01:52:03,060
Please, Maya, believe me.

1224
01:52:03,397 --> 01:52:04,921
Prince has very little time.

1225
01:52:10,737 --> 01:52:11,795
Gun.

1226
01:52:18,178 --> 01:52:19,110
Let me see, darling.

1227
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:24,047
The coin that's responsible for
all this, how does it look?

1228
01:52:25,519 --> 01:52:27,510
Priya.
Prince has very little time.

1229
01:52:27,788 --> 01:52:30,814
Please, Baby, l just..l
just want to see it.

1230
01:52:38,565 --> 01:52:39,657
Thank you.

1231
01:52:43,603 --> 01:52:44,729
What are you doing, Priya?

1232
01:52:44,805 --> 01:52:45,999
Give me back the coin, Priya..

1233
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:49,538
You're so stupid, Mike.

1234
01:52:50,644 --> 01:52:51,770
What did you think..

1235
01:52:52,646 --> 01:52:55,740
..a girl like me can fall in
love with an idiot like you?

1236
01:52:59,352 --> 01:53:04,016
There's just one idiot
in this room.

1237
01:53:05,358 --> 01:53:06,825
And that's not me.

1238
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:09,021
l'll shoot if l've to.

1239
01:53:09,629 --> 01:53:10,721
Bye, loser.

1240
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:21,766
Priya was right.

1241
01:53:22,142 --> 01:53:23,370
You're a loser, Mike.

1242
01:53:24,111 --> 01:53:26,807
Don't worry, Maya, Prince
will be absolutely fine.

1243
01:53:27,848 --> 01:53:30,840
l'm not a loser,
l've the real coin.

1244
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:38,423
l'd learnt about Priya's
greed long time back.

1245
01:53:39,192 --> 01:53:40,591
So, which coin was that?

1246
01:53:40,961 --> 01:53:43,156
The same duplicate coin
that you gave Prince..

1247
01:53:43,396 --> 01:53:44,556
..and Prince gave to Sarang.

1248
01:53:45,899 --> 01:53:48,891
lf l can steal the entire
brain-mapper software..

1249
01:53:50,570 --> 01:53:52,128
..from Sarang's laptop,
can't l steal a coin?

1250
01:53:56,309 --> 01:53:57,401
Okay.

1251
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:01,438
This is it.

1252
01:54:01,948 --> 01:54:03,006
Here goes.

1253
01:54:18,598 --> 01:54:21,158
You're incomplete without
your memory, Prince.

1254
01:54:21,735 --> 01:54:23,100
And l'm incomplete without you.

1255
01:54:24,004 --> 01:54:25,494
Come back, Prince.

1256
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:30,205
Or else..or else,
we'll lose this battle.

1257
01:54:33,813 --> 01:54:35,440
Come back, Prince.

1258
01:54:36,616 --> 01:54:37,708
Please.

1259
01:54:38,518 --> 01:54:39,610
Come back, Prince.

1260
01:54:41,555 --> 01:54:42,613
Come on.

1261
01:54:57,737 --> 01:54:58,829
Come on, Prince.

1262
01:54:59,739 --> 01:55:00,797
Come back.

1263
01:55:06,346 --> 01:55:14,253
Maya. -Please. Come back.

1264
01:55:20,694 --> 01:55:23,686
Mike. Save me.

1265
01:55:26,933 --> 01:55:27,991
Priya!

1266
01:55:40,380 --> 01:55:41,438
No!

1267
01:55:44,017 --> 01:55:45,211
Maya, no. Maya.

1268
01:55:51,958 --> 01:55:53,152
No!

1269
01:55:59,532 --> 01:56:01,295
You'd one chance to live.

1270
01:56:02,269 --> 01:56:04,931
But,
maybe, you're in a hurry to die.

1271
01:56:13,079 --> 01:56:14,068
Serena.

1272
01:56:57,457 --> 01:56:59,948
Sarang, we know you're here.

1273
01:57:00,660 --> 01:57:02,651
But there's no escape
for you this time.

1274
01:57:03,396 --> 01:57:04,294
Do you hear me?

1275
01:57:04,631 --> 01:57:06,155
No escape Sarang.

1276
01:57:07,067 --> 01:57:08,159
Put your hands up.

1277
01:57:09,135 --> 01:57:10,466
And come out, one by one.

1278
01:57:23,817 --> 01:57:24,909
Go, go.

1279
01:57:29,556 --> 01:57:30,420
Wait.

1280
01:57:48,074 --> 01:57:49,200
Prince.

1281
01:57:50,810 --> 01:57:53,574
Prince..l..l..

1282
01:57:54,981 --> 01:57:56,141
l'm sorry.

1283
01:58:00,987 --> 01:58:02,147
Sarang, Prince.

1284
01:58:04,758 --> 01:58:05,656
Let him go.

1285
01:58:05,992 --> 01:58:07,152
We've the coin.

1286
01:58:07,727 --> 01:58:08,625
Go.

1287
01:58:31,551 --> 01:58:32,848
They've reduced firing.

1288
01:58:33,787 --> 01:58:35,778
Looks like they're running
out of bullets

1289
01:58:35,922 --> 01:58:36,911
No, Sarang is fleeing.

1290
01:58:36,990 --> 01:58:38,116
From behind.

1291
01:59:19,265 --> 01:59:20,527
Don't worry, Prince.

1292
01:59:22,035 --> 01:59:24,435
We'll soon find out
Sarang's location.

1293
01:59:25,839 --> 01:59:27,329
Colonel Khanna has gone after him.

1294
01:59:29,309 --> 01:59:33,302
Colonel Khanna didn't go after
him. He went with him.

1295
01:59:35,315 --> 01:59:36,441
What the..

1296
01:59:38,451 --> 01:59:39,440
Blanks.

1297
01:59:40,553 --> 01:59:43,545
There were no bullets in
any of l-GRlPs' guns.

1298
02:00:37,377 --> 02:00:39,436
That means we were wrong.

1299
02:00:39,546 --> 02:00:40,740
We were wrong the whole time.

1300
02:00:43,016 --> 02:00:44,881
Sarang had already bribed Khanna.

1301
02:00:45,718 --> 02:00:47,515
He'd all the details.

1302
02:00:48,154 --> 02:00:49,621
He knew bloody everything.

1303
02:00:51,891 --> 02:00:54,155
And now..now we've lost him.

1304
02:00:54,894 --> 02:00:58,261
Trust us, Officer Khan,
we'll find him. -How?

1305
02:01:00,033 --> 02:01:01,864
We just won't be able
to find him now.

1306
02:01:05,171 --> 02:01:06,297
We'll.

1307
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:12,509
Wherever Sarang has gone,
he must have worn his shoes.

1308
02:01:30,597 --> 02:01:33,225
l'm sorry, but sometimes..

1309
02:01:33,333 --> 02:01:35,426
..good news comes to those
who wait for it.

1310
02:01:36,669 --> 02:01:37,829
Do you've the coin? -Yes.

1311
02:01:38,204 --> 02:01:40,399
And very soon you shall have it.

1312
02:01:57,824 --> 02:01:58,882
Sarang. -Yes.

1313
02:01:59,592 --> 02:02:00,854
Where are we going?

1314
02:02:02,395 --> 02:02:03,453
ls it safe?

1315
02:02:03,963 --> 02:02:07,831
l'm safe.
Don't know about you. -What?

1316
02:02:08,101 --> 02:02:09,125
Just kidding.

1317
02:02:12,572 --> 02:02:14,005
Look outside, Khanna.

1318
02:02:14,440 --> 02:02:15,566
This is Sharakiya.

1319
02:02:15,808 --> 02:02:18,504
The point between the border of
Pakistan and Afghanistan..

1320
02:02:18,945 --> 02:02:21,038
..which is no-man's land..
But belongs to everyone..

1321
02:02:21,614 --> 02:02:24,606
..there's a base-camp located
seven kilometres from here.

1322
02:02:28,788 --> 02:02:30,050
Here you can find every weapon..

1323
02:02:30,123 --> 02:02:31,590
..from every country.

1324
02:02:32,191 --> 02:02:33,886
But no weapon of any country..

1325
02:02:34,027 --> 02:02:36,621
..can locate us here.

1326
02:02:41,434 --> 02:02:43,834
Tell Khanna that Prince can
locate you anywhere.

1327
02:02:44,137 --> 02:02:46,605
How did you find out
about my location?

1328
02:02:48,708 --> 02:02:52,041
Ask your shoe, Sarang. -Shoe?

1329
02:02:58,217 --> 02:02:59,616
lt's show time.

1330
02:03:58,511 --> 02:03:59,569
Rogue.

1331
02:04:00,246 --> 02:04:03,807
Sarang, coin.

1332
02:06:08,774 --> 02:06:10,708
Captain, down, down.

1333
02:06:33,799 --> 02:06:35,426
Prince!

Could you get him please?

Niz? Yeah, just one second.

12

Figs!

13
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,916
Howâs it hanging brother?

14

Precariously.

Figs, Jay.

18
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:32,625
Hello Figs.

19
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,416
Interesting name.

20
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,666
Yeah. Itâs short for Figaro.

21
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,250
Like the opera?

22
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:42,916
Yes...

23
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,375
Mozart.

24
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,708
My parents.
Theyâre lovers of the opera.

25
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,208
Ok then...

26
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:51,958
Thatâs new.

27
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:52,666
Thank you.

28
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,708
Awesome stuff!

29
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,125
It's your stuff!

30
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,208
Oh yes! Correct.

31
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,458
Niz! What the...

32
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,208
Where have you been?
Iâve been waiting, like forever!

33
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:18,583
I am a traveler, lost in a storm.

34
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:24,125
All I want to do is to love you.

35
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,916
You are my light, my inspiration.

36
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,958
You are my love,
my reason to live.

37
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,458
Maggie, I love you!

38
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,166
Wow! What awful poetry!

39
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:48,458
Figs...

40
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,416
A photographer and a poet!

41
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,166
Fantastic.

42
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,708
Good catch, Maggie.

43
00:04:55,041 --> 00:05:00,083
Figs. How's it going?

44
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,166
Yeah... well...

45
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,000
...pillaging, licentiousness and
drunken debauchery.

46
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,083
You know, the usual.

47
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,875
And you, sir?

48
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,208
Just chilling.

49
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,416
So... Weâll be back!

50
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,333
Oh and Figs...

51
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,958
Take it easy on the drinks 'yo'!

52
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:32,625
Ok 'yo'...

53
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:33,625
- See you.
- Bye.

54
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,208
Mishra! Tell me somethingâ¦

55
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,000
Just roll another joint.

56
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,541
Yes, indeed!

57
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,333
- Maggie.
- Hey!

58
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,416
- Happy Birthday!
- Thank you.

59
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,708
You donât smoke?

60
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,708
No. Is that a problem?

61
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:23,291
Yes, yes, yes...

62
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,375
No, no, no...

63
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,250
Why do guys always do that?

64
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,916
Do what?

65
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:02,125
You know? Have a smoke after...

66
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,083
How many guys have you known?

67
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,833
So, why are you sitting here?

68
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,291
Excuse me?

69
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,333
If youâve got something to say...

70
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:21,458
...just say it.

71
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,625
Apologies. Whatâs your deal?

72
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,458
Excuse me?

73
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,541
You heard me.
Whatâs your deal?

74
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,416
Figs, you donât know Jay?

75
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:38,375
Jayshri Bose! President, LSR Debsoc.

76
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,958
Debate! How cool! Wow...

77
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,875
Why don't you give us a rundown
of that debate speech?

78
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,125
So Figaro, whatâs your deal?

79
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,416
Mine?

80
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,375
I am just in love with hash.

81
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,125
Yeah!

82
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,750
Why so serious, Mr.?

83
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,583
Nothing.

84
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,625
I was just thinking...

85
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,958
I might have to leave
 town for a few days.

86
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,291
Iâm going to head to the hills.

87
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,207
Why? What happened?

88
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,625
Some work. Photography work.

89
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:44,000
Cool. So take me with you!

90
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,208
No! Itâs work.

91
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,083
No! Itâs work...

92
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,583
Come on! Donât be silly.

93
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,000
Hey! What are you doing?

94
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,791
Youâll break it, baby! Stop it.

95
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,125
Of course not.
I know how to use this.

96
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,375
No. Stop. Donât do that.

97
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,291
Come on. Smile.

98
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,041
I said stop!

99
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Come on... Niz!

100
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,625
Donât make me use force!

101
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,666
Force is good.

102
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,541
So Jay, howâs everything in college?

103
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,500
Great.

104
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,500
In fact Iâm working
 on a new assignment.

105
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,625
Weâre doing a case
study on political refugees.

106
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,583
Niz and I, we have this
old school friend, Thupten.

107
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,708
He has become quite the
spokesman for a free Tibet.

108
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,166
Nice.

109
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,458
Itâs a cause worth fighting for.

110
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,666
Listen to this bull shit!

111
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:01,375
Wow...

112
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,875
Guess everyoneâs
entitled to an opinion...

113
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,833
Even the drunk village idiot!

114
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,791
Who do you think you are?
Che Guevara?

115
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,458
No, youâre not!

116
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,333
Not even close.

117
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:18,041
Youâre just a silly, delusional,
bourgeois girl with a stick up her ass.

118
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,250
Who do you think you are?

119
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:25,541
Youâre just a self-involved, vacuous...

120
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,041
...Freak.

121
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,750
What pretentious use of English!

122
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,958
Listen. Whatâs your name?

123
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,791
- Jay, right? Jay?
- Yeah.

124
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:35,916
Listen, Jay.

125
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:41,333
I know the worldâs a fucked up place
but Iâm also smart enough to know...

126
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,750
...that thereâs nothing that you or I...

127
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,541
...sitting here in this
 beautiful posh farm house...

128
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,583
...can do about it.

129
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,250
So Iâm just going to sit
 here and smoke this doobie...

130
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,500
...while the world can go fuck itself.

131
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,375
Youâre an ass hole.

132
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,708
Yeah... I am!

133
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,208
Drop the yuppie act, will you? Get real.

134
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,666
Here she is folks!

135
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,791
Revolutionary Bose to the rescue.

136
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,791
Fighting evil and doing good.

137
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:07,916
How cute.

138
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,875
Youâre right.

139
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,791
It is cute.

140
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,916
What? Jay? Jay?

141
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:24,625
Figs! Figs! Are you
ok, brother?

142
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,750
Itâs all good. Itâs all good.

143
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,125
Everyoneâs a critic.

144
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,708
Figs? Figs?

145
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,875
Figs Bhardwaj... the things you do.

146
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,208
Good morning!

147
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,333

170
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,833
I bought them fresh from the Ritz,
Mr. Gupta. Just for the two of you!

171
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,625
The Ritz?

172
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,500
Yes.

173
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,666
We had our last kitty party there.

174
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,583
A resounding success.

175
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,208
Iâm sure it was!

176
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,458
Why donât you join us
 the next time, Vandana!

177
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,458
Weâre having a bake sale
at the club.

178
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,500
Come early for cocktails.

179
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,500
I certainly will.

180
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:31,625
Will I not be invited?

181
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,000
Look. He wants to come as well.

182
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,750
Hey Figaro! Where have you been?

183
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,791
Come sit with us...

184
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,583
Weâve been waiting for
you for over an hour, dear.

185
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,333
Sorry guys! Apologies...

186
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,791
There was an emergency at
 Maggieâs place. It was kind of a...

187
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:44,875
What? What happened?

188
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,250
This girl, this friend of
Maggieâs I think she was...

189
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,958
...she was having this
 existential crisis and...

190
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,791
...I stayed up all night
consoling the poor creature.

191
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,708
Figaro! What rubbish!
Now come on...

192
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,375
Figaro, Figaro. Meet Mr Gupta...

193
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,583
Hello Figaro.
Pleasure meeting you.

194
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,000
And Mrs Gupta...

195
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:05,750
Hi.

196
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:10,000
Figaro, your dad tells me...

197
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:14,291
...that youâre interested
in corporate law?

198
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,875
Well actually...

199
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,541
No problem.
Come over tomorrow!

200
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,791
Weâll create a position of
a research assistant for you!

201
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,125
No problems at all.

202
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,625
No, no, no. Not tomorrow.

203
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,916
He has to finish his
application to Harvard first.

204
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,916
How about the day after?
Three in the afternoon?

205
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,291
Harvard? Thatâs great!

206
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,125
Weâre actually also trying
for an MBA you know...

207
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,750
Then he can always
help Arun in his shipping.

208
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,125
But somehow I feel that...

209
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,541
...law is far more appealing.
Donât you think?

210
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,666
Definitely. Definitely.

211
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,500
He will have a fantastic
experience with us.

212
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,833
Then heâll go to Harvard...

213
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,083
...and then heâll come back and
join us as a junior partner. Isnât it?

214
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,541
- Figaro. Figaro.
- Figaro.

215
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,500
Wouldnât that be wonderful?

216
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:03,958
Talking of shipping, Arun.
Howâs the business going?

217
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,708
Well, not too terrible...

218
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,000
Itâs this bloody! Oh Iâm sorry.

219
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:13,500
Itâs this recession, Iâve had
to cut back by like 12.77 percent...

220
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:17,416
Iâve had to get rid of some of my cargo
ships and cancelled so many contracts.

221
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,875
Itâs all this ridiculous taxation.

222
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,208
I mean what are the...
what are the government folks doing?

223
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:25,541
Forcing us back into the socialist
hell-hole that we just climbed out of.

224
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,375
I mean... just bloody ridiculous.

225
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,583
Howâs the tea?

226
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,083
Hmm Lovely.

227
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,708
Darjeeling Oolong.

228
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,458
First flush.

229
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:38,916
A cup a day and all your
sorrows dissipate, Mr Gupta.

230
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:58,708
Figs!

231
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,833
You son of a--

232
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,083
...no, not you!

233
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,458
Actually, youâ¦

234
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:05,708
Where are you?

235
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,625
Yeah, well, Iâm just
grabbing a bite...

236
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,708
...in Hauz Khas Village.

237
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,165
Listen! Letâs go get
some chocolate fudge.

238
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:12,958
Right now?

239
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,165
Yes! Now...

240
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,040
Iâm picking you up, ok? Bye.

241
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,083
This is but the beginning!

242
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,833
The battle is yet to comeâ¦

243
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,665
This is but the beginning!

244
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,290
The battle is yet to comeâ¦

245
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,083
This is but the beginning!

246
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,458
Look, you love writing...

247
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,166
This is what you want to do!

248
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,500
Why do you need to go
along with it?

249
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,666
Maggie...

250
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,125
...youâre just not going to get it!

251
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,125
Itâs my parents...

252
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,416
...theyâre just from another planet.

253
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:53,958
Figs...

254
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,958
...I thought you were
better than this.

255
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,958
Psycho parents isnât
exactly a novelty.

256
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,041
Weâve all been there.

257
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,708
Come up with something better!

258
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,208
Yeah, well, I guess Iâm not
such a good writer after all.

259
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,541
Listen, Maggie,
tell me somethingâ¦

260
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,041
Whatâs the scene with this guy?

261
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,833
Niz?

262
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,208
I mean...

263
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,791
...so far, so good, I guess.

264
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:22,875
Itâs just thatâ¦

265
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,375
Donât get me wrong.

266
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,875
I mean, I love him.

267
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,791
Heâs great and
heâs so talented and...

268
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,791
Itâs just sometimes...

269
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,083
...you know, he doesnât
want to go out anywhere...

270
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,416
...doesnât want to spend
on anything. Itâs a bitâ¦

271
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,000
Maybe thatâs because heâs
not loaded like you Maggie.

272
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:41,750
Shut up.

273
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,000
Drop the yuppie act, will you?

274
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,333
Keep it real.

275
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,541
What?

276
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,458
Nothing, nothing.

277
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,333
Well, at least youâre leaving
me conscious this time around.

278
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,500
Sorry, I have to go.

279
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,500
Weâll chill some other time.

280
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:00,625
You need a ride?

281
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,666
No I think Iâll just
hang here for a bit.

282
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:04,375
Cool.

283
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,250
Go, go, go play footsie or
whatever it is you do.

284
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,541
Oh, and I forgot.

285
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,000
Iâm out of hash.
Can you give me some?

286
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,208
Think Iâm out as well, sorry.

287
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:26,000
Shit. Ok, so...

288
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,166
...ask Mishra.

289
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,125
Yeah Iâll do that.

290
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,625
If I can find him that is.

291
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,333
Ok, bye.

292
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:35,708
Maggie!

293
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:36,541
Yeah?

294
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,958
Nothing, nothingâ¦
See you!

295
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:41,666
Bye.

296
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,791
Bye.

00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,250
Sit...

308
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,041
Mishra!

309
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:47,875
How are you?

310
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,375
Same old.

311
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,041
So...

312
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,583
Yeah so....

313
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,083
Last night was an experience, yeah?

314
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:06,458
Yeah well, guess
you could say that.

315
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,666
I mean you and Jay really hit it off?

316
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,375
What? Are you crazy?

317
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:18,083
No. Anyway I wanted to know
if I could score some hash?

318
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,708
Any chance I can get some... hash?

319
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,875
Hash. Hash...

320
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,250
Oh hash...

321
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,166
Do you have some?

322
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,583
Yes... certainly!

323
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,541
Hash. Hash...

324
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:51,708
Figs, looks like Iâm out.

325
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,583
Youâre joking, right?

326
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,708
No, no, no, Iâm serious.

327
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,583
Ok tell me, in the meantime...

328
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,541
Could I interest you in some keta?

329
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,750
I just scored it from our
good friends over at the...

330
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:10,083
...Government of India
veterinary institute.

331
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,500
But whatâs this?

332
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,000
Ketamine. Horse tranquilizer.

333
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:22,750
Yeah, well...

334
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:26,291
No cream, man?

335
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:27,208
No.

336
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:30,625
Just check if you have any cream.

337
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,166
M Cream.

338
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,583
M Cream. The best
hash in the world.

339
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,416
One puff and nirvana.

340
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,416
Sweet enough for Shiva himself.

341
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,708
Itâs gone. Itâs gone
my friend. Itâs finished.

342
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,083
Itâs returned to the
pantheon of the destroyer.

343
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,625
Alas. In that case
we mortals lie bereft.

344
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,083
This is a dire situation!

345
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,583

<i>round and round it goes.</i>

346

347
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:22,333

348
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,041
<i>Life, how does it matter anyway?</i>

349
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,125
<i>Itâs just a brothel.</i>

350
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,833
<i>And round and</i>
<i> round and round it goes.</i>

351
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:46,875
Arun, get up! We have to
go for lunch to the Khotsâ.

352
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,708
You know what theyâre
 like... sticky. Come on.

353
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:52,875
Oh dear. Iâm ready, Iâm ready.

354
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:05,708
You know, Arun...

355
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:08,125
Iâve been thinking,
we should take Figs with us.

356
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:12,000
What the hell for? Let the young lad
do some work for a change.

357
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:14,416
You remember Irina?

358
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,208
Who?

359
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:17,583
Mr and Mrs Khots little girl.

360
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:18,250
Ah.

361
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:23,208
It just so happens sheâs come back from
the US and sheâs not so little anymore.

362
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:24,041
Oh.

363
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I think she would make
a great match for Figs.

364
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:30,250
A very suitable couple.

365
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:33,250
But I thought young Figs was besotted
with, whatâs her name, Maggie.

366
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,375
Forget about Maggie.

367
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,125
What was that noise?

368
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,041
Figs!

369
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,208
Whatâs going on?

370
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:57,416
Hey guys.

371
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:00,166
Where do you think youâre going?

372
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,750
Iâm just heading to the hills.
Iâll be gone for a few days.

373
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
What? Why?

374
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:07,166
Road trip.

375
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,916
Road trip? What are you
talking about? Are you serious!

376
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,791
Yeah, I should have
 told you this earlier but...

377
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:16,166
You know, this is all very
dramatic and awkward and stuff...

378
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,083
So Iâm just going to take your leave.

379
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,000
See you guys!

380
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:19,958
Figs!

381
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:24,708
Youâve got to stop running if you really
want to find what youâre looking for.

382
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:33,000
Arun! Do something!

383
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,791
Vandana! Do What?

384
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:40,416
<i>""Yes Iâll be chasing...""</i>

385
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:45,166
<i>""...all you to the street.""</i>

386
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:51,291
<i>""Iâll be chasing. Iâll be racing...""</i>

387
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:56,416
<i>""...you to the street.""</i>

388
00:25:58,208 --> 00:25:59,875
<i>""To the street.""</i>

389
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,625
See you later!

390
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,083
Hello.

391
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:06,833
Hey! Come on. Letâs go.

392
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:08,291
Whoa.

393
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:12,250
Oh Figs. Youâve met Jay, right?

394
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:13,833
She went to school with Niz.

395
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:17,166
Hi.

396
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:19,208
You guys know each other?

397
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:25,375
No... Thankfully.

398
00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:28,666
Oh.

399
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:29,833
Oh.

400
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,625
Maggie, I didnât know she was coming.

401
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,833
- Figs, relax.
- You should have told me.

402
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:41,416
- So whatâs the big deal?
- Maggie...

403
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:45,416
I hope you have enough booze
at least. I just got one bottle with me.

404
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:46,541
Yeah. Itâs at the back.

405
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,250
- Niz, can you just check?
- Yeah, yeah...

406
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:51,916
At your service!

407
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:58,333
So... Two bottles of vodka.

408
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:04,333
Coke, vodka and more vodka.

409
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:05,625
Maggie?

410
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,291
What? I like vodka.

411
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:10,083
No scotch?

412
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,833
Nope.

413
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:12,625
That must be corrected.

414
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:13,291
Yeah.

415
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:17,125
Scotch? All right.

416
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:19,041
You drink whiskey?

417
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,125
Yes.

418
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:25,125
Thatâs nice. Cool, me too.

419
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,958
Weâll pick it up
on the way. Come on...

420
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:29,625
Letâs go.

421
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:30,541
Getting late...

422
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:33,750
Ready guys?

423
00:27:35,416 --> 00:27:36,708
- Youâll tell me later.
- Yeah I will.

424
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:44,416
<i>On the road again.</i>

425
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:51,083
<i>None are more hopelessly enslaved than</i>
<i> those who falsely believe they are free.</i>

426
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:56,333
<i>And there we were,</i>
<i>children of chaos and anarchy.</i>

427
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:58,875
<i>Escaping into the endless unknown.</i>

428
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:01,958
<i>We are free.</i>

429
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:05,041
<i>On the road again.</i>

430
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:10,875
Butter chicken and bread?

431
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:11,958
Sir, itâs over.

432
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:15,291
Ok.

433
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:17,500
Mughlai chicken and bread?

434
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:18,625
Sir, itâs over.

435
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:20,500
Is anything available?

436
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:23,458
- Sir, you tell me!
- No you tell me!

437
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:24,958
Chicken fry...

438
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:26,416
- And bread?
- Yes, sir.

439
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,083
Done.

440
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:28,750
With vegetables on the side.

441
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:30,375
- Ok.
- Thank you.

442
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:33,625
So where are we spending the night?

443
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,416
Oh... At this abandoned guest
house just off the highway.

444
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:40,791
My uncle owns it, heâs a minister.

445
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:43,208
Abandoned?

446
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:48,833
Yeah. I think it used to be Indira Gandhiâs
 guest house or something like that.

447
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,666
But no one lives there anymore.

448
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:53,791
Haunted house.

449
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:57,125
Shut up, Niz.
Donât kid around.

450
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:02,250
Iâm scared of ghosts.

451
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:04,375
Yeah, ghosts are so scary.

452
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,958
Anyway screw that.

453
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:09,791
Mababajagal here we come!

454
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,250
I can smell the cream
and it smells good.

455
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:14,916
What is he talking about?

456
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:16,541
Weâre going to Dharamsala.

457
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,000
What the hell is Mababajagal?

458
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:20,875
Dharamsala?

459
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,833
Jay, right...

460
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:31,833
Mababajagal is this
mythical magical place.

461
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,291
The source of M Cream,
this mythical magical hash.

462
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:38,083
And... weâre all going
to go look for it.

463
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:40,916
And Figs...

464
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:43,833
We are going to Dharamsala first.

465
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:47,375
Jay and Iâve got an
old friend there, Thupten.

466
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:50,291
Plus sheâs doing a
write-up on Tibetans...

467
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:51,375
...in exile...

468
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:54,166
...and Iâm taking photographs.

469
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,083
Remember I told you?

470
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:58,708
The assignment...

471
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,750
What?

472
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:03,250
What are you looking at me for?

473
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:07,916
Will you grow up?

474
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:09,833
Yeah...

475
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:10,875
Maybe I will.

476
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,916
When you stop being a
self-righteous, little bimbo!

477
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:16,208
Listen, relax.

478
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:17,875
Itâs not her fault.

479
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:23,291
I think Iâve diagnosed
 your problem, Figaro.

480
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:24,166
Really, what is it?

481
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:27,833
Youâre just a spoilt, selfish brat...

482
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,916
...who thinks of nothing
other than his own petty existence.

483
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:33,583
And youâre just a
hypocritical little bimbo.

484
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,041
Hypocritical?

485
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,208
Oh yeah?

486
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:37,791
People like you...

487
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:41,166
...spout shit about this cause
and that cause...

488
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,625
And you sit here
doing nothing about it.

489
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,500
Itâs almost funny
if it werenât so pathetic.

490
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:48,333
I do what I do...

491
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:50,333
...because it affects me.

492
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:51,208
Ok?

493
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:54,416
It affects me when thereâs a
 random terrorist attack in my city.

494
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:58,666
It affects me when the government
goes on and on about our rising GDP...

495
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,041
...when a majority of our
people are still poor.

496
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:04,166
And it affects me that no
one gives a damn about Tibet.

497
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,416
Because thereâs no
oil there, thereâs only people.

498
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:08,500
It affects me so fuck you!

499
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,833
It affects you?

500
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:11,625
Miss, I hate to say it...

501
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:13,958
...but youâre a walking clichÃ©.

502
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:16,541
Come on... Unbelievable.

503
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,750
Figs.

504
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:24,208
Whatâs your problem?

505
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:31,958
Drama.

506
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:33,375
I love it.

507
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:38,541
<i>""And for all</i>
<i>those locks and keys...""</i>

508
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:42,500
<i>""...yeah, we leave</i>
<i>them all behind...""</i>

509
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:49,041
<i>""For the leaves</i>
<i>and for the trees...""</i>

510
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:52,750
<i>""For the countless lullabies.""</i>

511
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,291
Spooky.

512
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:56,833
Shut up.

513
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:03,791
Sleeping arrangements. Shotgun, Niz
and I will take the big bedroom.

514
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:05,625
Jay, you can have the other one.

515
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:09,416
And Figs, the couch
is all yours.

516
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,416
Yay!

517
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:13,208
Niz, make the drinks quickly!

518
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:14,250
Thatâs what Iâm doing.

519
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:18,583
Yuck! This place is so dirty.

520
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:21,208
This place is beautiful.

521
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:25,666
I am so exhausted.

522
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,125
Here you go!

523
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:30,208
Thank you.

524
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:34,416
And here you go...

525
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,625
A toast to us... a toast to us...

526
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:49,958
...and to the dangerous promise
of the unknown road ahead.

527
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,791
Iâll drink to that!

528
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:54,958
Cheers.

529
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:04,541
So...

530
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,166
Do you guys do these
road trip things often?

531
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:09,458
You think?

532
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:14,125
Getting Niz to go someplace is like getting
Anna Hazare to clean up corruption.

533
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,291
Easier said than done.

534
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:19,791
Well unlike some people
I have to earn a living.

535
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,583
What are you going to do?
Working class blues...

536
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,625
Whatâs with that attitude?

537
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:28,250
Nothing...

538
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,875
Itâs just that
you seem to forget that...

539
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:35,708
...we did go to Jim Corbett
over winter break.

540
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,083
For, like, two days!

541
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:41,333
And please thatâs because Rishi was
going through this animal planet phase.

542
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:42,666
It doesnât count.

543
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:43,916
Whoâs Rishi?

544
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:47,875
Rishi Rastogi. We used
to hangout a lot, earlier...

545
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:54,375
He came out. Yeah...
became quite an issue.

546
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:58,500
His dad was furious, threw
 him out and all that stuff.

547
00:33:58,583 --> 00:33:59,250
Thatâs sad...

548
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:03,541
...we modern Indians arenât as
open minded as we pretend to be.

549
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:04,625
Anyway...

550
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:08,958
He moved in with this guy
 somewhere in North Campus and...

551
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,166
...I guess we drifted apart.

552
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:15,166
Seconds please.

553
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:18,708
That was quick!

554
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:23,291
So should we play some music?

555
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:24,833
Iâm on it.

556
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,291
Much obliged.

557
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:29,833
Miss Bose.

558
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:33,583
Come on, sexy.
Show me some moves!

559
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:34,833
Ok.

560
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:36,541
Come on.

561
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:52,458
What are you doing?

562
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:54,583
Nothing.

563
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:56,791
Do you write?

564
00:34:59,250 --> 00:34:59,833
No.

565
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:02,416
Well, it looks like youâre writing.

566
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:08,708
Ok, well, yeah...
A little bit.

567
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:13,541
You know, Jay?

568
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:14,333
Hmm...

569
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:16,041
I was meaning to
 talk to you about this...

570
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:19,875
...well, look, I am sorry, all right.

571
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:24,250
I know I was a little hard on you earlier.

572
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:28,750
Is that a smile?

573
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:31,250
No.

574
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,416
Looks like one.

575
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:34,416
Looks can be deceiving.

576
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:35,500
Uh huh.

577
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:40,000
Actually, Figs...

578
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:47,583
Iâve given it some thought and
 weâre not so different, you and I.

579
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:50,500
Youâre drunk already?

580
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:55,208
No! Well maybe a little...

581
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,875
Thank god.

582
00:35:58,125 --> 00:35:59,916
Can you imagine being
sober around those two?

583
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:02,166
No, I canât...

584
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:09,625
I digress, the point is that we both
view the world in very similar ways.

585
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:10,458
Uh huh.

586
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,041
Scary as that sounds.

587
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:16,458
I mean, think about it... Itâs a mess!

588
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:22,500
On the one hand weâre the fastest
growing economy, the biggest democracy,

589
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:24,625
Poster boy for
all things awesome...

590
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:26,583
And on the other hand?

591
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,000
Where was I?

592
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,500
The other hand...

593
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:37,166
Right...

594
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:40,000
Fucking chaos.

595
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:46,666
And you get that. Like me.

596
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:49,333
Oh yeah, I do?

597
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:50,625
Yeah...

598
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:57,291
Yeah, a lot of people donât.
Or at least they donât seem to.

599
00:36:58,791 --> 00:36:59,708
Do you know what I mean?

600
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,000
Not really.

601
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:02,208
Good night, guys.

602
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:03,583
Good night.

603
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,916
Till the morning comes.

604
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:08,125
Go get a room, already...

605
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,000
What do you think we are doing?

606
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:18,708
I donât know what he sees in her.

607
00:37:19,791 --> 00:37:22,250
Heâs like the perfect guy.

608
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:24,541
Perfect guy?

609
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,166
So...

610
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:32,958
I was saying something important.

611
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:34,916
Were you?

612
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,000
Yeah, about how weâre not so...

613
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:37,916
Exactly.

614
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:43,833
Hey, can you pass
me the bottle please?

615
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:45,125
Might as well.

616
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:59,250
Wow. Iâm proud of you, you
 didnât seem like the drinking type.

617
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:04,250
Why not? Stereotypes are dangerous.

618
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:13,625
Yeah, well... you just seem extremely
wholesome! Nice, simple, girl next door.

619
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:20,625
Huh... What?

620
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:22,208
What does that mean?

621
00:38:25,916 --> 00:38:27,875
Yeah, you know...

622
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:29,958
...you Bengali women...

623
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:35,833
...are just a bunch of
cliquish, pseudo intellectuals.

624
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:39,083
Are you kidding me?

625
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:39,958
No.

626
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:45,916
You Punjabi boys are just a
 bunch of cheap, flashy brats!

627
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,458
At least youâre easy on the eyes...

628
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:53,000
Is that a compliment?

629
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:55,708
No.

630
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:00,875
So, I was saying...

631
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:03,041
As you were saying...

632
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,250
Yeah.

633
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:10,750
Never mind.

634
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:17,791
Where are you going?

635
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:21,750
Got to get more booze silly.

636
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:26,625
Look at this woman...

637
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,666
You got to go to sleep silly!

638
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,416
No.

639
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,500
Letâs go! Get up.

640
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:32,708
Come on, Get up man!

641
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:36,041
You, evil boy. What are
 you doing? Put me down.

642
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,625
- You are getting to bed.
- Iâm fine, Figaro.

643
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:40,166
No, you are not. Sleep!

644
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,000
- I donât want to sleep.
- Yes.

645
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:44,375
You are getting to bed, right now.

646
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:46,916
No, please...

647
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:51,291
- Booze, Can I have more booze?
- No.

648
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:55,958
Goodnight.

649
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:58,125
Goodnight.

650
00:40:02,041 --> 00:40:03,000
See you.

651
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,375
- Hold on.
- It's stuck.

652
00:40:13,583 --> 00:40:14,375
Come on.

653
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:16,208
Move, ok, move, let me do it.

654
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:19,958
Hey!

655
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:21,041
Youâre late.

656
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:21,875
Youâre grumpy.

657
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,916
Whatever.

658
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:24,625
Can I just dump this?

659
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,541
Good morning.

660
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:26,708
Hey...

661
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,333
Welcome, finally.

662
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:30,875
Let's go.

663
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:33,166
All aboard?

664
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,958
- Yes, letâs go.
- So hung over.

665
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,750
Shut up.

666
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:26,666
<i>""Speak no evil.""</i>

667
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:32,625

682
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:00,583
Thupten!

683
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:03,416
Jay! How are you?

684
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:04,208
Absolutely fine.

685
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:05,750
I wasnât sure when
you guys were coming.

686
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:07,083
- I know, we got here much earlier.
- Thupten!

687
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:09,125
- Hey, Niz...
- How are you?

688
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:10,208
Iâm good. How are you?

689
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:11,000
Very well.

690
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,291
Ah! This is Maggie.

691
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:16,291
- Hi.
 - Hello.

692
00:44:17,916 --> 00:44:20,750
And... Yeah, that is Figs.

693
00:44:20,916 --> 00:44:23,125
- Hey, how are you?
- Very good.

694
00:44:23,958 --> 00:44:25,625
So, whoâs hungry?

695
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:26,583
- Me.
- Me.

696
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:28,000
Great!

697
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:34,875
So, Figs and Maggie,
how do you like 'Little Lhasa'?

698
00:44:35,375 --> 00:44:37,375
I love it. Itâs gorgeous.

699
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:43,000
Itâs a strange place.

700
00:44:43,916 --> 00:44:44,875
How so?

701
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:48,375
I mean, yeah itâs gorgeous of course...

702
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:52,625
...but thereâs this strange
brew of politics and religion.

703
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:56,000
Things that I find
completely unnecessary.

704
00:44:57,041 --> 00:45:01,416
Itâs a beautiful place,
 caught up in a pointless exercise.

705
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:05,375
I mean, Tibetâs
never going to be free ...

706
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:10,750
And praying isnât going to solve
 anything. Itâs all pretty pointless really.

707
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:17,333
The cause is hopeless,
perhaps. But not the fight...

708
00:45:18,291 --> 00:45:21,625
I believe in fighting. My faith
has certainly helped me in that.

709
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:24,875
Well, Iâm not so convinced...

710
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:28,916
Frankly religion hasnât done
 much other than divide and destroy...

711
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:33,625
Itâs an emotional crutch.

712
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:36,708
Figs has a point there.

713
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:43,916
Ah! I do? I mean,
yeah I do... Of course.

714
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:51,666
Movements need to be organic, they
need to matter. They need to be real.

715
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:56,250
Thatâs when things can change
but very often that reality...

716
00:45:56,416 --> 00:45:59,833
...gets sidelined by many
forces, including religion...

717
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:04,583
...I donât know if Iâm
making any sense.

718
00:46:07,583 --> 00:46:11,541
People believing in something is different
than people being told to believe in something.

719
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,750
The source is love after all.

720
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:18,083
I agree that you need to
question religion if it invalidates love.

721
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:23,125
I think... I donât know.

722
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:29,000
Just live and let live.
I mean, thatâs my point!

723
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:32,541
Thatâs a flawed point, Niz!

724
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:36,875
Our generation achieves
nothing because weâre passive by nature...

725
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:40,583
And the funny part is, we have
 a voice, we just donât know it.

726
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:42,041
- There is nothing passive about--
- Ok!

727
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:44,750
Letâs just change the topic.

728
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:55,958
Arenât you sick of her
 soapbox lectures? I know I am.

729
00:46:58,208 --> 00:47:00,916
In Buddhism, we have a saying.

730
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:05,208
'A straw floats
on the surface of water...'

731
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:07,916
'...but a precious gem
placed upon it sinksâ.

732
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:13,583
You know what? I donât get it.

733
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:21,000
Ok Iâll see you guys
tomorrow. Good night!

734
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Hey, hey!

735
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:31,583
- Oh. Hey!
- Whatâs going on?

736
00:47:32,375 --> 00:47:36,583
Phew. It was getting really
 intense in there. Had to get out.

737
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:42,583
So, you like freezing?

738
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:47,083
I like breathing in fresh
air while itâs still around.

739
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:56,291
You know, you were
 really drunk the other night?

740
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,208
You do remember
some of that, donât you?

741
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,375
Was I? Which night?

742
00:48:01,958 --> 00:48:03,083
Precisely.

743
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:09,875
Youâre very fond of Maggie.

744
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:13,041
Why do you say that?

745
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,208
Itâs pretty obvious Figs.

746
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:16,958
Yeah.

747
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:22,500
Yeah well, I am... I was.

748
00:48:25,291 --> 00:48:27,500
But Iâm not so sure
anymore, though.

749
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:32,750
We should go.

750
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,625
No we shouldnât.
We should stay right here.

751
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,166
Prisoners of the night.

752
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:01,166
Good morning, sir.

753
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:02,958
Hey, slept well?

754
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,208
Like a rock.

755
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:07,208
Tea?

756
00:50:07,958 --> 00:50:09,458
Mmm... Perfect.

757
00:50:14,583 --> 00:50:15,875
Here...

758
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,083
Thanks.

759
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:20,291
And, here you go!

760
00:50:21,791 --> 00:50:23,583
- Toast, butter and jam.
- Yummy!

761
00:50:26,916 --> 00:50:29,666
Niz told me you guys
are going to Mababajagal?

762
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:31,833
Have you heard of it?

763
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:34,333
Some say itâs the oldest
democracy on earth.

764
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:36,125
Really?

765
00:50:36,583 --> 00:50:40,583
And they have the best hash too.

766
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,500
What are you reading?

767
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:49,000
An article by Marie Sartre,
this French journalist.

768
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:52,958
Oh my god! I love her.
Sheâs fantastic.

769
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,208
She really writes it
like it is, you know!

770
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:58,541
Yeah. Do you know that sheâs been
 in this area for quite some time now?

771
00:50:59,208 --> 00:51:01,666
Here? I had no idea.

772
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:05,000
She has been writing extensively
on this Paradise Found project.

773
00:51:05,458 --> 00:51:06,416
Whatâs that?

774
00:51:06,916 --> 00:51:09,791
This international chain is
trying to build a luxury resort.

775
00:51:10,166 --> 00:51:12,166
They are soon going
to cut down the forest.

776
00:51:12,791 --> 00:51:13,791
What?

777
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:19,666
The villagers are protesting,
the protest is gaining momentum.

778
00:51:19,916 --> 00:51:20,583
Is it?

779
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:24,166
Of course the media and activists
from all over have been pouring in.

780
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:29,916
And... Iâm sure they could
 use all the help they can get.

781
00:51:30,125 --> 00:51:32,125
Since you are going
to be in the area...

782
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:34,791
...it might be worth stopping by.

783
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,166
Thupten, Iâd love to!

784
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:42,291
But itâll depend on the others...

785
00:51:45,458 --> 00:51:47,458
Iâll definitely try.

Is this Mababajagal?

796
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:48,625
Honey, It ainât.

797
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:52,125
Mababajagalâs on the
other side of the mountain.

798
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,791
Thirty miles as the crow flies.

799
00:52:56,875 --> 00:52:58,291

Dharamsala.

803
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:16,916
Well I reckon you took a wrong turn
 someplace. Itâs funny how that happens!

804
00:53:17,958 --> 00:53:22,250
Iâm Vishnu Das by the way.
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

805
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:25,625
And this, here, is my little lady.

806
00:53:26,916 --> 00:53:27,916
Hello.

807
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,958
You can call me Sunshine Daydream.

810
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:36,791
Hi.

811
00:53:37,125 --> 00:53:39,125
Whatâs your name, sweetheart?

812
00:53:39,291 --> 00:53:40,166
Meghna.

813
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:43,958
Figs, Iâm Figs.

814
00:53:45,041 --> 00:53:47,166
All right. So weâre all friends now.

815
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:51,500
So Vishnu sahib,
where are we exactly?

816
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:55,875
Oh. The Elysian fields...

817
00:53:56,125 --> 00:54:00,666
...the garden of Eden,
the abode of Aphrodite.

818
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:05,333
We just call it the commune.

819
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:10,750
<i>Itâs just up around the corner.</i>

820
00:54:11,625 --> 00:54:14,833
<i>I donât know what it is</i>
<i>but it keeps getting stronger.</i>

821
00:54:16,541 --> 00:54:21,291
<i>Painted faces beneath the diamond sky,</i>
<i>dancing bodies on the emerald earth.</i>

822
00:54:22,166 --> 00:54:24,166
<i>Flowers in her hair and</i>
<i>madness in her eyes.</i>

823
00:54:25,958 --> 00:54:27,958
<i>Itâs just up around the corner.</i>

824
00:54:30,708 --> 00:54:35,541
<i>I feel like an outlaw,</i>
<i>a fugitive on the run.</i>

825
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,875
<i>I guess there is no turning back.</i>

826
00:54:39,458 --> 00:54:41,583
Donât knock it if
you havenât tried it!

827
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:47,291
Like books are food for the mind,
 LSD is food for the soul.

828
00:54:49,541 --> 00:54:51,416
Call me a dirty old
hippie, if you like...

829
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:55,750
...but if we all smoked pot and
tripped on acid every now and then,

830
00:54:56,291 --> 00:54:58,541
the world would be a lot groovier...

831
00:54:59,083 --> 00:55:00,750
...I do believe it!

832
00:55:02,958 --> 00:55:05,125
You and Figs would get along great!

833
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:06,166
Yeah?

834
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:13,125
Hey!

835
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:14,416
Hi!

836
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,166
Letâs go. Whereâs Niz?

837
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:23,708
- I left some stuff in the car.
- Oh!

838
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:30,041
Niz is such an idiot.
I mean, weâre completely lost...

839
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:32,333
What a mess.

840
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:34,916
Chill. Weâll find the way.
Itâs ok.

841
00:55:41,291 --> 00:55:44,000
Is everything ok?

842
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,166
Yeah. Thanks for your concern!

843
00:55:50,041 --> 00:55:50,625
What do you mean?

844
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:57,041
Figs, just because youâve found a
girlfriend, will you forget your friends?

845
00:56:00,375 --> 00:56:02,041
What do you mean, Maggie?

846
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:04,208
Huh?

847
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:05,416
Nothing. Forget it.

848
00:56:06,416 --> 00:56:12,166
I first came to this country in 1968,
part of the infamous hippie exodus.

849
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:16,208
Itâs sort of been home ever since...

850
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,291
Got myself a little
shack around the corner.

851
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,750
I give tours, lectures...

852
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:29,458
...write
books on meditation. Yeah.

853
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:34,166
For a kid from Baton Rouge, Louisiana,
Iâd say thatâs doing all right!

854
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:39,916
Say, Iâd love to have
you kids over sometime!

855
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:45,375
You donât need to buy anything!
Well it wouldnât hurt if you did...

856
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:46,583
If we did what?

857
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:50,208
Vishnu Das has invited us
to his charming establishment.

858
00:56:51,166 --> 00:56:51,750
Oh, whatâs that?

859
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:55,583
He runs a shack and he might
have some things that will interest us.

860
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:56,541
What do you guys say?

861
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:58,041
- Sounds good.
- Yeah sure.

862
00:56:58,291 --> 00:56:59,583
All right, letâs go!

863
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,625
Hey Mr. Vishnu!

864
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:16,333
Do you happen to have any decent
accessories to go along with this one?

865
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:18,666
That oneâs a real beauty, ainât she?

866
00:57:19,666 --> 00:57:24,625
Iâve got some hash if thatâs what
you mean, kid. But it ainât no cream!

867
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,750
You know the government
folks are building some...

868
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:31,625
...glitzy resort between
here and Mababajagal.

869
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:34,083
And thereâs been trouble
with the locals!

870
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,750
We canât get any decent hash.

871
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,916
Is the trouble bad?

872
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:45,375
Well there ainât no such
 thing as good trouble!

873
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:50,833
You know, my advice is if you all
are planning on heading there anyway...

874
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:53,375
...you all might as well wait.

875
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,625
Oh no! I canât wait,
Iâm sick of waiting, please.

876
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:02,083
Well, patience is a virtue, sweetheart.

877
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,375
And you strike me
as the virtuous kind.

878
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:12,958
Well, Iâll take this one.
For posterity then.

879
00:58:13,333 --> 00:58:14,791
You wonât regret it!

880
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:18,416
Sir. Weâre running low on booze and...

881
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:22,333
...I get that you donât have any cream but is
there some other way you could sort us out?

882
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:29,083
Well, letâs see if I
can help you all out.

883
00:58:30,166 --> 00:58:35,583
Could I interest you in some acid?

884
00:58:39,958 --> 00:58:45,041
Nothing floats your
boat quite like LSD.

885
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:48,250
Mr. Vishnu, trust me I know...

886
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:51,416
Ok, weâll take three stamps.

887
00:58:51,791 --> 00:58:52,708
Three?

888
00:58:53,083 --> 00:58:54,333
Make that four.

889
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:57,208
Are you sure about this?

890
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:02,291
Donât knock it if you
havenât tried it, right?

891
00:59:02,541 --> 00:59:04,000
Right.

892
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:06,541
Great.

893
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:30,791
Slowly, slowly stay my mind.

894
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:36,250
Slowly everything happens.

895
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:40,541
The gardener may
water a hundred times...

896
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:44,791
...but when the season comes,
there is fruit.

897
00:59:45,875 --> 00:59:48,916
This banana is fantastic.

898
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:54,500
Did you just say that?

899
00:59:55,541 --> 00:59:57,416
Itâs magical.

900
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:16,458
I donât think Iâve seen an
orange as orange as that.

901
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:19,416
This orange, actually, ever before.

902
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:23,333
Youâre messing up my
picnic. Are you nuts?

903
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:26,125
Look!

904
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,333
This orange...

905
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:08,458
Yes, madam?

906
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,500
It must die.

907
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:26,375
It must die...

908
01:01:47,416 --> 01:01:49,291
Listen!

909
01:04:35,375 --> 01:04:37,875
<i>Sun king plays on my face.</i>

910
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,791
<i>Crystal parliaments shatter easy.</i>

911
01:04:42,458 --> 01:04:44,458
<i>Sun king plays on my face.</i>

912
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,041
<i>Love is atomic sugar.</i>

913
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,958
<i>Sun king plays on my face.</i>

914
01:04:52,333 --> 01:04:53,833
<i>Two strands merge.</i>

915
01:05:40,333 --> 01:05:44,208
Guys, we should probably
hit the road soon...

916
01:05:44,791 --> 01:05:46,791
Food is good.

917
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:48,750
Food is good.

918
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:50,583
I love food.

919
01:05:51,375 --> 01:05:52,625
I love food too.

920
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:55,458
I just lost my appetite.

921
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,708
- Good morning, kids.
- Good morning.

922
01:06:06,166 --> 01:06:06,750
Coffee?

923
01:06:07,708 --> 01:06:09,375
I donât mind if I do.

924
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:21,125
How was the acid trip?

925
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,333
Full power.

926
01:06:27,208 --> 01:06:27,833
Jay?

927
01:06:31,208 --> 01:06:33,125
Glad to be of service.

928
01:06:36,875 --> 01:06:38,291
- Is everything ok?
- Yeah.

929
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:58,250
Darling... Darling, make love.

930
01:06:58,375 --> 01:06:59,208
No darling!

931
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:00,250
Make love not...

932
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:11,083
I was going to say
make love not war.

933
01:07:12,666 --> 01:07:15,416
Sheâs been mad as a wet
hen these last few days.

934
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:20,958
Itâs our annual Moon
Rave tonight. Lots to do...

935
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:23,291
Moon rave? Whatâs that?

936
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:26,583
Well, a bunch of kids get
 together every other night.

937
01:07:28,416 --> 01:07:34,500
They do drugs and have sex and then
 they do more drugs and have more sex.

938
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:36,125
Thatâs pretty much it.

939
01:07:36,416 --> 01:07:37,250
Ok.

940
01:07:37,708 --> 01:07:40,500
Sounds like fun. We should go right?

941
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:43,583
I donât know,
we should get going.

942
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:46,833
Come on! We can
hit the road tomorrow.

943
01:07:48,166 --> 01:07:49,875
Do we always have to
do what you want?

944
01:07:52,208 --> 01:07:56,416
Niz! Weâve come this far,
we might as well go all the way.

945
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,291
Letâs just do what Jay wants.

946
01:08:09,583 --> 01:08:12,875
This place was such a happy accident.

947
01:08:13,125 --> 01:08:13,791
Yeah.

948
01:08:15,708 --> 01:08:21,957
Maggieâs party seems like so
long ago. Doesnât it, Figaro?

949
01:08:22,125 --> 01:08:26,750
It seems like years ago. And you
were so friendly to me that night.

950
01:08:26,832 --> 01:08:27,582
Hey!

951
01:08:30,207 --> 01:08:32,082
But is it not love that
knows how to make...

952
01:08:32,207 --> 01:08:35,166
...smooth things rough and
 rough things smooth?

953
01:08:36,916 --> 01:08:38,166
Thatâs deep.

954
01:08:38,832 --> 01:08:42,125
It is. Itâs not me,
itâs Vikram Seth.

955
01:08:44,332 --> 01:08:44,916
Ah.

956
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:49,541
I was just thinking
that things change.

957
01:08:49,916 --> 01:08:53,541
Yeah. But... I mean, come on,
wouldnât life be boring if they didnât?

958
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:55,582
I guess.

959
01:08:57,582 --> 01:09:00,207
Sometimes things get more
complicated than they should be.

960
01:09:00,291 --> 01:09:02,582
I mean, look at the four of us...

961
01:09:04,916 --> 01:09:08,832
Yeah. Changes upon changes,
we are more or less the same.

962
01:09:09,707 --> 01:09:10,666
Vikram Seth?

963
01:09:11,207 --> 01:09:13,541
Close. Simon and Garfunkel.

964
01:09:15,082 --> 01:09:15,832
Idiot.

965
01:09:16,416 --> 01:09:20,332
Letâs head back!
We have a long night ahead.

966
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:22,832
Oh god! The rave.

967
01:09:44,332 --> 01:09:45,832
Give me two whiskeys, yeah?

968
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:51,832
Insane.

969
01:09:52,082 --> 01:09:53,082
What?

970
01:09:54,708 --> 01:09:56,916
This is insane!

971
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:59,958
What... What? Itâs not your scene?

972
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:03,625
Come on, look at
this place! Itâs beautiful.

973
01:10:05,666 --> 01:10:06,916
I donât know.

974
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:12,625
I always saw the world
in shades of black and white.

975
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,625
And now there is all this color!

976
01:10:19,333 --> 01:10:21,458
Yeah. Itâs funny that
you say that because...

977
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:25,458
...I just feel like thereâs
so much color...

978
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:28,500
Now, I finally see a bit
of black and white.

979
01:10:46,625 --> 01:10:47,375
Hey!

980
01:10:47,458 --> 01:10:48,875
Vishnu Das is shooting up.

981
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:50,625
What?

982
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:52,625
Vishnu Das is shooting up!

983
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:54,333
Shooting up?

984
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:57,416
Brown Sugar, baby. Heroin.

985
01:10:58,083 --> 01:10:59,458
Maggie, this is...

986
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:01,541
Arenât you a little bit curious?

987
01:11:03,041 --> 01:11:04,000
Maggie this is not...

988
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,333
I want you to do this with me...

989
01:11:05,416 --> 01:11:06,708
Maggie, listen!

990
01:11:06,791 --> 01:11:08,375
Under any other circumstances...

991
01:11:08,708 --> 01:11:10,875
...maybe I would have
But this but this...

992
01:11:10,958 --> 01:11:13,125
What? Speak up!
I canât hear you.

993
01:11:13,291 --> 01:11:15,291
Maggie! It is not a
good idea, come on...

994
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,583
What is wrong with you?

995
01:11:20,833 --> 01:11:21,916
Whatever.

996
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:44,541
Welcome to the twilight zone.

997
01:11:52,166 --> 01:11:54,166
Nice place.

998
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:12,041
Are you afraid, sweetheart?

999
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:21,833
Fear is the mother of morality.

1000
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:52,666
Itâs my first time.

1001
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:55,708
Iâll be gentle.

1002
01:13:13,416 --> 01:13:15,666
What the fuck... Whatâs
going on here?

1003
01:13:18,166 --> 01:13:20,041
- Figs!
- Hey! Stay groovy.

1004
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:22,125
Vishnu Das! Grow the fuck up.

1005
01:13:25,458 --> 01:13:26,458
Show me your hand...

1006
01:13:26,541 --> 01:13:28,541
What is this?
This is dangerous!

1007
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:31,000
Who the hell do
you think you are?

1008
01:13:31,208 --> 01:13:33,208
Who me? Iâm your friend, Figs.

1009
01:13:34,416 --> 01:13:36,375
Well, I was chilling.

1010
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:40,666
- Chilling... You call this chilling?
- Yeah.

1011
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:44,375
Ok, Ms. Rebel-without-a-cause,
go... Go! Chill...

1012
01:13:46,583 --> 01:13:47,875
Hypocrite.

1013
01:13:48,833 --> 01:13:50,083
What?

1014
01:13:50,333 --> 01:13:52,541
You heard me!
Youâre a hypocrite.

1015
01:14:01,958 --> 01:14:03,083
Maggie, listen!

1016
01:14:03,416 --> 01:14:05,416
First of all, I care
for you, all right?

1017
01:14:05,583 --> 01:14:07,500
And second of all, you
shouldnât be messing with this!

1018
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:10,083
Itâs dangerous stuff.
Maggie, youâre crazy or what?

1019
01:14:11,125 --> 01:14:13,125
Whatâs going on
with you, Maggie?

1020
01:14:44,125 --> 01:14:45,416
- Niz!
- What the hell was that?

1021
01:14:46,125 --> 01:14:47,416
- Niz!
- What the fuck was that?

1022
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:49,458
Nothing. Take it easy.

1023
01:14:49,541 --> 01:14:50,416
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

1024
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:51,541
Calm down...
Whoa! easy man!

1025
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:52,500
Fucking easy!

1026
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:54,125
Niz!

1027
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:59,333
Niz... Come on,
Niz! Stop it.

1028
01:14:59,666 --> 01:15:00,958
Niz! Niz!

1029
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:06,041
Nothing happened,
ok, nothing--

1030
01:15:08,125 --> 01:15:10,750
You know, I tried really hard to
be what you wanted me to be.

1031
01:15:12,416 --> 01:15:13,708
And I did it because
I loved you.

1032
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:21,375
But I guess love is just
a four letter word.

1033
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:30,041
Fine! Youâre not even worth it.

1034
01:16:09,458 --> 01:16:11,458
Oh God...

1035
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:31,750
Where is everyone?

1036
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:44,916
Excuse me. Where did they go?

1037
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:46,708
- Who?
- The others I was staying with.

1038
01:16:46,791 --> 01:16:47,708
I donât know what
you are talking about.

1039
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:49,666
- Did they leave a message?
- I don't know.

1040
01:16:50,583 --> 01:16:52,041
Hello stranger!

1041
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:54,916
Hey, Maggie!
Where were you?

1042
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:57,416
I was going to wake you but...

1043
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:58,875
...then I decided against it.

1044
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:03,333
Ouch, you poor thing.

1045
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:06,125
Anyway, come, letâs go...

1046
01:17:06,208 --> 01:17:06,916
Where to?

1047
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:09,250
Come, get your bags.
 Letâs get out of here!

1048
01:17:10,958 --> 01:17:11,666
What?

1049
01:17:13,208 --> 01:17:13,958
Say something...

1050
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:18,375
Whereâs Jay? Whereâs Niz?
What's going on?

1051
01:17:19,875 --> 01:17:20,458
I donât know...

1052
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:22,166
I think they left.

1053
01:17:41,666 --> 01:17:42,958
Itâs not the end of the world.

1054
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,083
Where are you going?

1055
01:17:48,541 --> 01:17:49,416
I don't know.

1056
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:53,333
We could go anywhere,
someplace far away...

1057
01:17:56,708 --> 01:17:58,708
You just let them leave?

1058
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:03,041
I didnât let them do
anything, ok?

1059
01:18:03,333 --> 01:18:04,333
They just did.

1060
01:18:05,583 --> 01:18:06,875
And who cares anyway?

1061
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:12,708
Maggie, whatâs the
matter with you?

1062
01:18:13,541 --> 01:18:14,625
Whatâs the matter with me?

1063
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,708
So this is all my fault now?

1064
01:18:18,083 --> 01:18:18,875
Typical.

1065
01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:21,000
You know you created
such a mess last night.

1066
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,125
And I was only trying
to help you...

1067
01:18:25,583 --> 01:18:27,958
You try so hard to stand out...

1068
01:18:29,041 --> 01:18:30,583
...and because of that
at the end of the day...

1069
01:18:30,666 --> 01:18:32,208
...you are just another conformist.

1070
01:18:34,458 --> 01:18:35,250
Am I?

1071
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,791
So what does that
make you then?

1072
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:42,833
Bye Maggie.

1073
01:18:45,458 --> 01:18:46,666
Figs, come on!

1074
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:48,458
Itâs you and me...

1075
01:18:56,625 --> 01:18:57,416
So what?

1076
01:18:58,791 --> 01:18:59,875
Thatâs it then?

1077
01:19:03,041 --> 01:19:03,916
Yeah.

1078
01:19:07,583 --> 01:19:08,916
Look, Figs!

1079
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:12,041
I know I fucked up...

1080
01:19:12,625 --> 01:19:15,375
...and everything was a big mess...

1081
01:19:18,416 --> 01:19:19,875
...but youâre my friend.

1082
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,166
Youâre supposed to
be there for me.

1083
01:19:27,625 --> 01:19:28,458
Maggie look...

1084
01:19:30,125 --> 01:19:31,458
...you know Iâm always
there for you.

1085
01:19:32,416 --> 01:19:33,083
But...

1086
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:37,750
...just this time I think you are going to
 have to figure this out on your own.

1087
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:40,458
I am sorry.

1088
01:20:27,916 --> 01:20:31,333
Sir. Itâs time to check out!
You need to leave.

1089
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:35,666
What are you saying?

1090
01:20:35,875 --> 01:20:37,708
- Iâll leave in half an hour.
- No, sir. Right now.

1091
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:39,625
- Half an hour!
- No, sir. Right now!

1092
01:20:39,791 --> 01:20:40,500
Ok.

1093
01:21:26,833 --> 01:21:27,791
Tea?

1094
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:29,416
Yeah.

1095
01:21:32,083 --> 01:21:33,250
Nice eye.

1096
01:21:37,375 --> 01:21:38,375
Thanks.

1097
01:21:39,541 --> 01:21:40,916
Maggie left.

1098
01:21:42,416 --> 01:21:43,625
So did Niz.

1099
01:21:44,583 --> 01:21:45,583
Oh.

1100
01:21:47,041 --> 01:21:50,083
He told me to tell you he is
 sorry for knocking you senseless.

1101
01:21:51,083 --> 01:21:52,208
Yeah.

1102
01:21:52,625 --> 01:21:53,875
No hard feelings?

1103
01:21:56,208 --> 01:21:57,416
Anyway.

1104
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:03,625
Figs, I know what happened
last night wasnât your fault.

1105
01:22:03,791 --> 01:22:05,041
Oh, really?

1106
01:22:06,791 --> 01:22:10,083
Weâre ok, just so you know.

1107
01:22:11,833 --> 01:22:13,083
Are you sure about that?

1108
01:22:17,041 --> 01:22:18,541
I think so.

1109
01:22:19,291 --> 01:22:23,416
Yeah. It just feels like some
kind of weird nightmare.

1110
01:22:25,166 --> 01:22:27,166
As the old adage goes...

1111
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,625
...âshit happensâ.

1112
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,625
Look, Iâm not promising anything.

1113
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:41,666
You donât have to.

1114
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,166
I screwed up.

1115
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,833
I thought you would
have left with Niz.

1116
01:22:56,166 --> 01:22:57,500
I almost did...

1117
01:23:02,125 --> 01:23:04,125
...but here we are.

1118
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:07,250
Indeed.

1119
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:13,916
I... I donât really know
 how to say this...

1120
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:16,333
Iâm not good at
expressing myself.

1121
01:23:19,583 --> 01:23:21,125
But I stayed...

1122
01:23:21,791 --> 01:23:22,791
...because...

1123
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:30,458
...because I wanted to.

1124
01:23:56,041 --> 01:23:57,375
Iâm catching a bus in a bit.

1125
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,041
A bus? Where are you going?

1126
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:02,833
You heard about that
resort they are building?

1127
01:24:04,666 --> 01:24:07,583
An entire village is going
to be completely destroyed...

1128
01:24:07,875 --> 01:24:09,750
...and unless someone does
something about it.

1129
01:24:10,791 --> 01:24:13,708
The governmentâs been
paid off, surprise-surprise!

1130
01:24:14,833 --> 01:24:16,916
Donât tell me you want to go
and save the world after this?

1131
01:24:21,041 --> 01:24:21,958
Anyhow...

1132
01:24:22,958 --> 01:24:25,208
Thupten says they need
all the help that they can get.

1133
01:24:25,708 --> 01:24:28,000
Marie Sartre is there.
She is covering the protest and...

1134
01:24:28,333 --> 01:24:31,208
...since our road trip has come
to this untimely end...

1135
01:24:34,416 --> 01:24:35,458
...we should go.

1136
01:24:36,083 --> 01:24:38,125
We should help in
whatever way we can.

1137
01:24:40,791 --> 01:24:42,083
Sounds boring.

1138
01:24:45,583 --> 01:24:48,125
But after all weâve been through...

1139
01:24:49,458 --> 01:24:51,416
I think boring is
exactly what I need.

1140
01:24:53,708 --> 01:24:55,083
Letâs go!

1141
01:25:18,958 --> 01:25:22,208
<i>We are burning embers in a</i>
<i>world of deepening shadow...</i>

1142
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:25,666
<i>...and the road we tread on has no end.</i>

1143
01:25:28,208 --> 01:25:30,208
<i>But there is still the sky...</i>

1144
01:25:30,916 --> 01:25:34,750
<i>...the windy mountain and</i>
<i>the river below it.</i>

1145
01:25:37,833 --> 01:25:38,916
<i>So letâs tread on.</i>

1146
01:25:40,166 --> 01:25:43,125
<i>Letâs climb to the highest</i>
<i>peaks of our dying kingdom.</i>

1147
01:25:43,791 --> 01:25:45,333
<i>For there is still the sky...</i>

1148
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:47,458
<i>...the windy mountain...</i>

1149
01:25:48,125 --> 01:25:49,166
<i>...and the river below it.</i>

1150
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:05,250
Thereâs nobody here.

1151
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,625
Ok, who is this journalist
we are looking for, again?

1152
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,375
Marie Sartre.

1153
01:26:19,291 --> 01:26:21,208
Any relation of Jean Paul?

1154
01:26:22,083 --> 01:26:22,833
Ha ha.

1155
01:26:27,416 --> 01:26:30,916
Excuse me! Hello.

1156
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:32,250
Hello.

1157
01:26:34,458 --> 01:26:37,791
I donât see anybody around,
where did the villagers go?

1158
01:26:38,458 --> 01:26:39,708
Go that way...

1159
01:26:39,833 --> 01:26:40,625
That way?

1160
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:43,791
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

1161
01:27:47,375 --> 01:27:50,958
Mr. Hariharan! Weâve tied
 around 800 Rakhis so far.

1162
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:53,916
Really! Good job.

1163
01:27:55,291 --> 01:27:56,833
- We are almost done.
- Yes.

1164
01:27:57,791 --> 01:27:59,458
These two have come from Delhi.

1165
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:00,625
Perhaps from the media.

1166
01:28:01,041 --> 01:28:01,833
What do you want?

1167
01:28:02,041 --> 01:28:04,833
Nothing! Weâre here to help you.

1168
01:28:04,958 --> 01:28:06,416
Weâre not from the media.

1169
01:28:07,416 --> 01:28:08,791
Marie Sartre?

1170
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:10,916
Thatâs me! Hi.

1171
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:14,083
Hi, my name is Jayshri Bose.

1172
01:28:14,416 --> 01:28:15,791
Thatâs Figs.

1173
01:28:16,166 --> 01:28:17,916
We heard through a
friend that you were...

1174
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,583
...in the area and about
whatâs going on here.

1175
01:28:19,666 --> 01:28:22,166
And we thought we
could, well, volunteer?

1176
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:26,625
Excellent. Welcome on board.

1177
01:28:27,208 --> 01:28:28,000
Thank you.

1178
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:30,041
This is my dear friend
Ram Hariharan.

1179
01:28:30,125 --> 01:28:30,791
Hello.

1180
01:28:31,083 --> 01:28:33,083
Heâs chief coordinator
 of the Resistance.

1181
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:35,416
Thatâs what we call ourselves.

1182
01:28:36,583 --> 01:28:40,750
Why donât you brief them.
I have to file a petition. Ok?

1183
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,250
Itâs a throwback to
the 'Chipko movement'.

1184
01:28:48,333 --> 01:28:51,750
These Rakhis are symbolic of
both protest and protection.

1185
01:28:56,208 --> 01:29:00,833
So what exactly is going to happen
if this resort does get built?

1186
01:29:01,625 --> 01:29:04,666
Well a lot of things...

1187
01:29:05,458 --> 01:29:07,291
In a nutshell,
this resort will signal...

1188
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:10,750
...the death of the people of these
hills and of the forest they love.

1189
01:29:14,208 --> 01:29:17,041
Weâve had some recent
success in stalling the project...

1190
01:29:17,375 --> 01:29:18,708
...but unfortunately...

1191
01:29:18,958 --> 01:29:20,250
...we just found out that...

1192
01:29:20,333 --> 01:29:23,666
...the Environment Ministry has
given the go ahead for the resort.

1193
01:29:24,458 --> 01:29:26,833
They are expected to start
pulling down trees...

1194
01:29:26,916 --> 01:29:28,125
...and seizing land...

1195
01:29:28,666 --> 01:29:30,875
- ...any day now.
- That's terrible.

1196
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:32,791
But, I mean...

1197
01:29:33,666 --> 01:29:36,208
...how can they give a go ahead
like this? Thatâs so strange.

1198
01:29:36,625 --> 01:29:39,166
Political pressure,
vested interests.

1199
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:41,291
Most importantly, moolah!

1200
01:29:41,791 --> 01:29:45,000
Everyone can be bought
 if the price is right.

1201
01:29:49,291 --> 01:29:53,666
Donât mind my asking but
arenât you a journalist?

1202
01:29:54,375 --> 01:29:55,416
Yes.

1203
01:29:56,916 --> 01:30:01,958
So shouldnât it be part of your
 job to be non-partisan...

1204
01:30:02,041 --> 01:30:04,375
...or unbiased or whatever
 it is you guys call it?

1205
01:30:05,708 --> 01:30:08,083
Well, Iâll leave this
to the Indian media...

1206
01:30:08,291 --> 01:30:10,791
...since they seem to be
doing such a great job.

1207
01:30:11,458 --> 01:30:12,916
Good one.

1208
01:30:14,625 --> 01:30:16,291
There is a difference, you know...

1209
01:30:16,375 --> 01:30:19,916
...between being biased and
 being true to yourself.

1210
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:25,083
There is a difference
between hyping a cause...

1211
01:30:25,708 --> 01:30:29,125
...and passionately advocating
a cause you believe in.

1212
01:30:36,458 --> 01:30:37,500
Radha...

1213
01:30:37,958 --> 01:30:39,500
Here! This is for you...

1214
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:46,625
Thatâs enough.

1215
01:30:46,833 --> 01:30:49,416
Eat! Tomorrowâs a big day.

1216
01:31:00,666 --> 01:31:01,708
Roti, anyone?

1217
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:03,916
Yes, please.

1218
01:31:09,458 --> 01:31:10,291
Marie.

1219
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:14,500
Iâve been meaning to tell you this...

1220
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:17,500
Donât really know how but...

1221
01:31:18,041 --> 01:31:20,250
I really admire your writing.

1222
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:23,750
What you say, your words...

1223
01:31:24,791 --> 01:31:25,958
...theyâre honest.

1224
01:31:26,708 --> 01:31:29,625
And thatâs just so rare.

1225
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:33,375
Itâs amazing to
finally meet you!

1226
01:31:34,208 --> 01:31:35,125
Thanks.

1227
01:31:35,666 --> 01:31:37,458
Iâm glad to meet
both of you too.

1228
01:31:38,541 --> 01:31:40,500
Itâs good to know
we are not alone.

1229
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,208
So how long have you been here?

1230
01:31:46,333 --> 01:31:48,083
For some months now.

1231
01:31:49,416 --> 01:31:51,416
It sounds crazy.

1232
01:31:56,875 --> 01:32:00,541
Itâs obvious that things are
not how they should be.

1233
01:32:01,166 --> 01:32:05,583
The value of our methods and
means of protest is less obvious.

1234
01:32:06,875 --> 01:32:08,000
Time will tell.

1235
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:12,458
We are nothing but a momentâs
sunlight fading in the grass.

1236
01:32:18,125 --> 01:32:20,875
I have no idea what that
means but it sounds beautiful!

1237
01:32:23,375 --> 01:32:24,458
Marie...

1238
01:32:24,875 --> 01:32:26,625
...what made you
 fight for this cause?

1239
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,041
What cause?

1240
01:32:28,375 --> 01:32:32,041
I believe in saving these
 people and their forest.

1241
01:32:32,458 --> 01:32:33,791
What about the bigger picture?

1242
01:32:33,916 --> 01:32:36,291
What about corruption
in India in general?

1243
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:39,166
Do you think we can fight that?

1244
01:32:40,291 --> 01:32:41,000
I do...

1245
01:32:41,625 --> 01:32:44,083
...but with a pinch of salt,
you might say.

1246
01:32:44,750 --> 01:32:45,750
What do you mean?

1247
01:32:46,458 --> 01:32:48,375
I believe in the potential
of the cause.

1248
01:32:49,458 --> 01:32:52,500
We stand witness to the
birth of a real revolution.

1249
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:54,625
I believe in that.

1250
01:32:56,458 --> 01:33:00,500
So, what brought you two here
to this picturesque battlefield.

1251
01:33:03,208 --> 01:33:04,375
Is everything ready?

1252
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,250
Yes, itâs all ready.

1253
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:09,583
We are filing another petition.

1254
01:33:09,916 --> 01:33:11,708
It wonât make a difference.

1255
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:14,666
In any case, we will
demonstrate tomorrow!

1256
01:33:15,125 --> 01:33:16,916
Can we help in any way?

1257
01:33:17,291 --> 01:33:18,833
Of course! We also
want to do something!

1258
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:19,750
Yes.

1259
01:33:19,875 --> 01:33:22,000
We will need all the
help we can get.

1260
01:33:24,291 --> 01:33:25,125
All right then...

1261
01:33:26,166 --> 01:33:27,500
...letâs all gather in the morning.

1262
01:33:30,541 --> 01:33:34,208
Are there going to be a lot of people
 at this demonstration tomorrow?

1263
01:33:34,458 --> 01:33:37,791
Villagers and activists, lawyers
and other professionals...

1264
01:33:38,291 --> 01:33:42,291
...farmers and truck drivers, teachers
and students like yourselves.

1265
01:33:42,875 --> 01:33:44,958
The revolutionaries of modern India.

1266
01:33:48,125 --> 01:33:49,791
Do you think itâs going
to make a difference?

1267
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:51,125
Who knows?

1268
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:54,416
The fact of the matter is that
we are taking a stand...

1269
01:33:54,916 --> 01:33:56,041
...and thatâs important.

1270
01:33:56,666 --> 01:33:59,208
Itâs one thing to call
yourself a revolutionary...

1271
01:33:59,291 --> 01:34:01,458
...and quite another
thing to live like one.

1272
01:34:03,583 --> 01:34:04,708
People have enough
things in the world...

1273
01:34:04,791 --> 01:34:07,333
...to be really pissed about
right now, I know that.

1274
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:14,000
But... I just wonder what
this struggle is doing...

1275
01:34:14,125 --> 01:34:16,291
...for the people of this village.

1276
01:34:16,875 --> 01:34:18,791
And thatâs scary.

1277
01:34:21,416 --> 01:34:24,750
Well this movement makes
sense to me in the now.

1278
01:34:25,583 --> 01:34:27,125
Thatâs why I support it.

1279
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,375
Fair enough for you, I suppose.

1280
01:34:30,416 --> 01:34:31,333
Still hungry?

1281
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:32,083
Thanks.

1282
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:32,750
No.

1283
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:38,833
But I could really use a
drink right about now!

1284
01:34:39,375 --> 01:34:40,291
Really?

1285
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:46,125
That should do...

1286
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:48,000
Oh, yes, thank you!

1287
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:01,458
<i>""If I've a babe in town, Babe.""</i>

1288
01:35:01,625 --> 01:35:05,333
<i>""It's just when you're around, Babe.""</i>

1289
01:35:05,458 --> 01:35:07,833
<i>""If I've a babe in town, Babe.""</i>

1290
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,875

1291
01:35:11,125 --> 01:35:13,583

1292
01:35:13,916 --> 01:35:17,250
<i>""Bound out for Texas state, Babe.""</i>

1293
01:35:17,375 --> 01:35:20,916
<i>""I caught a long slow freight, Babe.""</i>

1294
01:35:21,083 --> 01:35:24,000
<i>""Bound out for Texas state, Babe.""</i>

1295
01:35:32,958 --> 01:35:33,791
Marie?

1296
01:35:45,166 --> 01:35:46,583
Oh.

1297
01:35:49,166 --> 01:35:51,458
<i>""Three days I hung around, Babe.""</i>

1298
01:35:51,625 --> 01:35:54,666
<i>""That lonesome Texas town, Babe.""</i>

1299
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:56,041
Letâs dance?

1300
01:35:57,041 --> 01:35:58,125
No, I canât.

1301
01:35:58,708 --> 01:36:01,416
<i>""Said you was sick and low, Babe.""</i>

1302
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:05,666

01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:10,916
<i>""Said you was sick and low, Babe.""</i>

1304
01:36:11,875 --> 01:36:12,958
Oh...

<i>""I took my car yet , Babe.""</i>

1306
01:36:41,291 --> 01:36:43,583

01:36:43,916 --> 01:36:46,416

01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:49,875

01:36:50,166 --> 01:36:52,708

<i>""When I got off that train, Babe.""</i>

1312
01:36:59,166 --> 01:37:02,416
<i>""You couldn't call my name, Babe.""</i>

1313
01:37:24,791 --> 01:37:29,166
This forest has given me life...

1314
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:35,291
...and I shall stand by it till I die.

1315
01:37:37,041 --> 01:37:38,375
My brothers and sisters...

1316
01:37:38,625 --> 01:37:42,250
...they call this project Paradise Found.

1317
01:37:42,666 --> 01:37:45,875
But I call it Paradise Lost!

1318
01:37:46,166 --> 01:37:47,750
Our forests will be cut...

1319
01:37:47,916 --> 01:37:52,041
...our land stolen, our homes broken!

1320
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:55,583
A state that attacks
her own people...

1321
01:37:55,708 --> 01:37:59,000
...is a state doomed
to self-annihilation!

1322
01:38:00,666 --> 01:38:01,541
My brothers and sisters!

1323
01:38:02,416 --> 01:38:05,750
They say this resort is a
symbol of development.

1324
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:09,750
At what cost?

1325
01:38:10,208 --> 01:38:12,583
The death of our forest?

1326
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:14,916
The death of our villages?

1327
01:38:15,708 --> 01:38:18,250
At what cost?

1328
01:38:18,541 --> 01:38:21,166
This resort is not a
symbol of development...

1329
01:38:21,416 --> 01:38:24,750
...it is a symbol of corruption!

1330
01:38:26,458 --> 01:38:29,750
My brothers and sisters, rise!

1331
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,083
Embrace our trees!
Save them from death...

1332
01:38:35,333 --> 01:38:39,041
It is the wealth of our hills.

1333
01:38:40,875 --> 01:38:45,291
We wonât let them build this resort!

1334
01:38:45,375 --> 01:38:47,875
Maâam, what is the
civil society doing about this?

1335
01:38:47,958 --> 01:38:53,666
We wonât let them build this resort!

1336
01:38:53,875 --> 01:38:55,416
Are you willing to go to jail for this?

1337
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:56,541
No comments.

1338
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:03,583
Thank you.

1339
01:39:06,291 --> 01:39:10,708
Friends. Today is a dark day.

1340
01:39:12,083 --> 01:39:17,791
The illegitimate government of
India has declared war upon us!

1341
01:39:19,250 --> 01:39:23,041
This luxury resort is the
bastard child of greedy politicians...

1342
01:39:23,166 --> 01:39:25,083
...and urban decadence.

1343
01:39:25,416 --> 01:39:29,125
It is a modern day mockery
of our age old values!

1344
01:39:29,583 --> 01:39:32,250
An insult to our Gandhian ways.

1345
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:36,291
The people of these
 hills, they are victims.

1346
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,208
They are victims of a
malaise which afflicts us all.

1347
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:44,875
That malaise is corruption.

1348
01:39:45,666 --> 01:39:48,916
They are the ones to be
sacrificed at the altar of avarice.

1349
01:39:49,458 --> 01:39:53,000
Mark my words,
we shall have revenge.

1350
01:39:53,666 --> 01:39:57,958
Let the ruling classes tremble
 at the prospect of revolution.

1351
01:39:58,958 --> 01:40:02,375
India against corruption!

1352
01:41:37,041 --> 01:41:39,416
<i>What does it mean to be</i>
<i> a revolutionary?</i>

1353
01:41:40,458 --> 01:41:42,041
<i>The war rages on...</i>

1354
01:41:43,958 --> 01:41:46,791
<i>We were knocked down by the</i>
<i>crushing force of a terrible defeat.</i>

1355
01:41:47,916 --> 01:41:50,375
<i>The futility of our actions</i>
<i>was only too obvious.</i>

1356
01:41:52,291 --> 01:41:55,166
<i>The extent of our insignificance</i>
<i>proved absolute.</i>

1357
01:41:57,541 --> 01:41:59,500
<i>If only I had stayed on...</i>

1358
01:42:01,125 --> 01:42:04,291
<i>But what could we do?</i>
<i>It was over.</i>

1359
01:42:06,916 --> 01:42:08,875
<i>What does it mean</i>
<i>to be a revolutionary?</i>

1360
01:42:10,166 --> 01:42:12,208
<i>The war rages on...</i>

1361
01:42:16,375 --> 01:42:18,708
<i>I was wrong when I</i>
<i>thought I was free...</i>

1362
01:42:20,583 --> 01:42:23,166
<i>...we are all enslaved in</i>
<i>chains of our own making.</i>

1363
01:42:25,125 --> 01:42:27,458
<i>What does it mean</i>
<i>to be a revolutionary?</i>

1364
01:42:28,625 --> 01:42:30,125
<i>The war rages on.</i>

1365
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:55,083
Weâve come a long way...

1366
01:42:56,166 --> 01:42:57,958
...but thereâs no destination in sight.

1367
01:43:01,208 --> 01:43:02,916
Faith is the bird...

1368
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:06,625
...that feels the light
when the dawn is still dark.

1369
01:43:08,625 --> 01:43:10,000
Thatâs deep.

1370
01:43:11,250 --> 01:43:12,291
Thanks...

1371
01:43:13,666 --> 01:43:14,916
Itâs not me, itâs...

1372
01:43:15,958 --> 01:43:17,958
...Rabindranath Tagore.

1373
01:43:20,791 --> 01:43:22,625
But itâs frustrating,
you know, all the same.

1374
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:26,666
What is?

1375
01:43:28,416 --> 01:43:30,250
Itâs been sixty years
since independence...

1376
01:43:31,250 --> 01:43:34,500
...and weâre still fighting
for the same thing...

1377
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:37,083
...for our freedom.

1378
01:43:41,666 --> 01:43:43,208
Someone once said...

1379
01:43:43,791 --> 01:43:48,500
...""When the power of love
overcomes the love of power...""

1380
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:51,666
""...thatâs when the world
will know peace.""

1381
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:54,916
Who said that?
Rabindranath Tagore, only?

1382
01:43:57,416 --> 01:43:58,500
Close.

1383
01:43:59,583 --> 01:44:01,083
Jimi Hendrix.

1384
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:18,208
We lost it, right?

1385
01:44:19,625 --> 01:44:21,333
Yeah. I guess so...

1386
01:44:25,833 --> 01:44:28,208
What is 'it'?

1387
01:44:32,666 --> 01:44:34,791
You know, weâve lost
 this battle I suppose.

1388
01:44:35,416 --> 01:44:37,250
But you know
as well as I do Jay...

1389
01:44:37,708 --> 01:44:41,000
...that thereâs a
thousand people fighting...

1390
01:44:41,083 --> 01:44:43,708
...a thousand battles
every single day...

1391
01:44:43,791 --> 01:44:45,375
...in this crazy country of ours.

1392
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:52,750
I wonder where those two are.
Niz and Maggie.

1393
01:44:59,208 --> 01:45:00,458
I donât know...

1394
01:45:03,250 --> 01:45:05,250
...but Iâm glad you are with me.

1395
01:47:06,666 --> 01:47:08,083
What happened?

1396
01:47:09,291 --> 01:47:10,500
Where the hell are we?

1397
01:47:16,625 --> 01:47:17,583
Do you have any water?

1398
01:47:54,416 --> 01:47:55,875
Did you see that?

1399
01:47:56,833 --> 01:47:57,708
No, did you?

1400
01:48:47,708 --> 01:48:51,083
<i>""I am a poor wayfaring stranger...""</i>

1401
01:48:57,500 --> 01:49:01,750
<i>""Wandering through this world of woe.""</i>

1402
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,875
<i>""And there's no sickness,</i>
<i>no toil or danger...""</i>

1403
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:20,458
<i>""In that bright land</i>
<i>to which I go.""</i>

1404
01:49:26,708 --> 01:49:30,083
<i>""I am going there</i>
<i>to see my sister.""</i>

1405
01:49:31,458 --> 01:49:34,875
<i>""Iâm going there</i>
<i>no more to roam.""</i>

1406
01:49:36,625 --> 01:49:39,916
<i>""I am only going over Firdaus.""</i>

1407
01:49:41,083 --> 01:49:44,708
<i>""I am only going over home.""</i>

1408
01:50:11,125 --> 01:50:14,000
Itâs been quite the journey, Figaro.

1409
01:50:15,791 --> 01:50:17,500
It certainly has, Miss Bose.

1410
01:50:20,333 --> 01:50:21,708
How do you know itâs over?

1411
01:50:23,291 --> 01:50:24,791
I never said it was.

1412
01:50:30,250 --> 01:50:31,500
Here we are...

1413
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:35,583
And now what?
"
tt7777196,Thackeray,"1
00:05:05,577 --> 00:05:10,413
You can see behind me, the
crowd has gathered at Lucknow Airport.

2
00:05:10,482 --> 00:05:13,247
The situation is pretty
tense all over Lucknow City.

3
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:14,462
What's the crowd gathered for?

4
00:05:14,486 --> 00:05:18,252
The entire city of Lucknow
has transformed into a campsite.

5
00:05:18,323 --> 00:05:19,154
What did he do'?

6
00:05:19,224 --> 00:05:20,820
Remember the Babri
Masjid (Mosque) case?

7
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:21,376
Yeah.

8
00:05:21,426 --> 00:05:22,018
That was him.

9
00:05:22,093 --> 00:05:23,671
You can pretty much sum up
how high profile this case <i>is...</i>

10
00:05:23,695 --> 00:05:25,220
from the crowd that's gathered here.

11
00:05:25,297 --> 00:05:26,607
Someone's coming
all the way from Mumbai?

12
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:27,996
Is it Amitabh (Bachchan)?

13
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:30,727
Who has been accused of
the Babri Masjid demolition.

14
00:05:31,002 --> 00:05:32,898
But he wasn't involved in the
Babri Masjid Demolition?

15
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:33,552
Wasn't he?

16
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:35,471
No, but he was supporting
the ones that did.

17
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,566
The entire country has
It's eyes on today's judgment.

18
00:05:38,643 --> 00:05:41,704
His supporters have gathered
around in large numbers...

19
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,248
just to catch a glimpse of him.

20
00:05:43,281 --> 00:05:45,272
But if he hadn't lent his support...

21
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,561
then this country
would still be burning!

22
00:05:46,585 --> 00:05:50,647
This is going to turn out
as the most different scenario...

23
00:05:50,722 --> 00:05:52,349
in Indian Politics.

24
00:05:53,558 --> 00:05:55,287
Greeting. Greeting. Greeting.

25
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:04,127
The CBI Lawyer claims
that the Babri Structure...

26
00:06:06,004 --> 00:06:08,234
Was he actually involved?

27
00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:11,338

Can't you hear?
Move back.

Move back. I said move back.

And 505... False Statement...

41
00:07:00,258 --> 00:07:02,659
Rumors, etcetera, circulated,

with the intent to cause mutiny,
or disturb public peace...

43
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:10,263

Thackeray!

53
00:08:47,665 --> 00:08:49,261
Make sure you deposit the cheque today.

54
00:08:49,286 --> 00:08:50,522
Thank you. Thank you, Sir.

55
00:08:52,771 --> 00:08:55,206
Rosy, did you get the
front-page layout yet?

56
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:56,684
- Find out whether they did or not.
- Okay, Sir.

57
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,369
The classified in
Free Press is confirmed.

58
00:08:58,443 --> 00:09:00,070
Just fax me the designs.

59
00:09:00,145 --> 00:09:01,203
Okay, sir.

60
00:09:04,215 --> 00:09:06,411
Govind, serve me filter coffee.

61
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:12,515
Here you go, Deshpande.

62
00:09:14,526 --> 00:09:16,807
There's a Memorial Service
at the Town Hall today at 7 pm.

63
00:09:18,463 --> 00:09:22,400
One of us dies and all we do is observe two
minutes of silence to pay our respects.

64
00:09:22,634 --> 00:09:23,726
We should be ashamed.

65
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:26,231
In fact, we shouldn't
stay silent about this at all!

66
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,130
Calm down, Thackeray.

67
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:34,172
We're lucky that we're the only
Maharashtrians in this entire office.

68
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:35,642
That's not good luck at all,

69
00:09:35,713 --> 00:09:37,112
It's out bad luck!

70
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:39,249
Sir.

71
00:09:40,718 --> 00:09:41,718
Back again?

72
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
The boss is calling you.

73
00:09:48,693 --> 00:09:49,693
Jairam,

74
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:52,187
How does it look'?

75
00:09:54,132 --> 00:09:57,466
I can never make
sense of your drawings.

76
00:09:58,136 --> 00:10:00,161
But it does make me laugh.

77
00:10:00,772 --> 00:10:03,298
You can't make sense
of my caricatures, can you?

78
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:05,670
Do one thing...

79
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:10,749
Laugh your heart out first.

80
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:12,708
Now imagine this...

81
00:10:13,284 --> 00:10:14,649
First, visualize a watermelon...

82
00:10:16,454 --> 00:10:17,649
Then add spectacles,

83
00:10:27,332 --> 00:10:29,198
Now try to imagine who this is?

84
00:10:33,037 --> 00:10:34,505
Sit. Mr. Thackeray.

85
00:10:35,573 --> 00:10:36,802
I said sit.

86
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,483
Your cartoons are becoming
sharper nowadays.

87
00:10:47,252 --> 00:10:49,687
I am pleased to know that
you understand my cartoons.

88
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:51,355
Thank you.

89
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:56,354
Stop going after that S K Patil!

90
00:10:56,561 --> 00:10:59,587
That NijLing Appa calls
me more than my wife in a day.

91
00:11:01,232 --> 00:11:02,996
And Morarji is completely off limits.

92
00:11:03,368 --> 00:11:05,496
You start a fire,
while I have pay the price.

93
00:11:07,172 --> 00:11:10,107
Thackeray,
This 'Press' is not for you alone.

94
00:11:11,543 --> 00:11:14,535
It's the breadwinner
for countless other families.

95
00:11:15,146 --> 00:11:17,478
So please stop trying to shut it down.

96
00:11:19,784 --> 00:11:22,549
If you restrict me
from using all my models...

97
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:25,355
then who am I going
to use for my caricatures?

98
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:32,524
Thackeray,
I have no doubt about your skills,

99
00:11:33,331 --> 00:11:37,666
but this 'Press' depends on
Advertisements and Good Relations.

100
00:11:38,503 --> 00:11:40,703
Why are you trying to ruin
the equations of my business?

101
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,660
I know you think you're your own boss.

102
00:11:43,808 --> 00:11:45,435
But I've superiors to answer to.

103
00:11:46,277 --> 00:11:47,637
It's me who has to face the music.

104
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:50,077
I love my job.

105
00:11:50,415 --> 00:11:53,612
That's the problem, Sir.
People love their jobs...

106
00:11:53,685 --> 00:11:54,685
No one loves their work!

107
00:11:56,521 --> 00:11:59,582
You can love your work,
and let me do my job.

108
00:12:00,058 --> 00:12:02,755
I am tired of explaining to you,
but you don't get it...

109
00:12:03,027 --> 00:12:07,055
I... I am an artist and
not some labourer!

110
00:12:13,504 --> 00:12:14,504
Hello.

111
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,401
Yes, sir.

112
00:12:17,275 --> 00:12:18,299
Yes, sir.

113
00:12:19,043 --> 00:12:20,563
Done, sir. Done, sir.
Will be done sir.

114
00:12:22,046 --> 00:12:24,071
Yes, sir.

115
00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:25,449
Yes, sir.

116
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:27,776
Good day, sir.

117
00:12:30,054 --> 00:12:31,054
Thackeray.

118
00:12:32,423 --> 00:12:34,016
Thackeray, at least listen to me.

119
00:12:38,796 --> 00:12:40,127
What the hell is this?

120
00:12:41,132 --> 00:12:42,132
What...

121
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,159
If you don't like my cartoons, then
my cartoons won't like you either.

122
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:48,130
And this is my resignation!

123
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:54,411
Get out!

124
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,275
No, the proof we got
last time wasn't right.

125
00:13:28,646 --> 00:13:30,205
I mean I need to talk to them.

126
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:30,747
Literature.

127
00:13:31,015 --> 00:13:32,676
- Sure.
- Let's go.

128
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,605
Tickets. Tickets. Tickets.

129
00:14:03,681 --> 00:14:05,012
Buy one.

130
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,313
Tickets.
Tickets, tickets! Dirt-cheap.

131
00:14:07,385 --> 00:14:09,581
Tickets. Tickets. Tickets.

132
00:14:23,735 --> 00:14:25,999
Tickets. Tickets. Tickets.

133
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,368
Tickets. Tickets. Tickets.

134
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:31,500
Balcony. Balcony. Balcony. Balcony.

135
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:33,134
Looks like a Cheapskate.

136
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:37,441
Tickets. Tickets. Tickets.

137
00:14:42,754 --> 00:14:44,153
Come on.

138
00:14:44,222 --> 00:14:45,519
Slowly. Slowly.

139
00:15:17,555 --> 00:15:20,650
We're lucky that we're the only
Maharashtrians in this entire office.

140
00:15:22,226 --> 00:15:22,988
Get out!

141
00:15:23,094 --> 00:15:25,153
That's not good luck at all,
It's out bad luck!

142
00:15:25,997 --> 00:15:27,641
We're lucky that we're the only
Maharashtrians in this entire office.

143
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:30,032
That's not good luck at all,
It's out bad luck!

144
00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:31,941
That's not good luck at all,
It's out bad luck!

145
00:15:32,003 --> 00:15:32,469
Get out!

146
00:15:32,537 --> 00:15:34,548
We're lucky that we're the only
Maharashtrians in this entire office.

147
00:15:34,572 --> 00:15:35,572
Get out!

148
00:15:35,673 --> 00:15:37,593
""Pancakes, Rice cakes,
Donuts, What do you want?""

149
00:15:38,576 --> 00:15:40,136
Marathi Manus:
""Can I get a cup of tea?""

150
00:15:45,383 --> 00:15:46,748
""Your tea. And hurry up.""

151
00:15:54,492 --> 00:15:56,017
""What are you two doing?""

152
00:15:56,093 --> 00:15:58,528
""You are spilling
your food all over me?""

153
00:16:09,574 --> 00:16:11,702
""Hey Ghati, get up. That's my seat.""

154
00:16:13,644 --> 00:16:14,644
""My seat.""

155
00:16:17,281 --> 00:16:18,749
""Move aside.""

156
00:16:25,256 --> 00:16:27,691
""The market's opens today at Rs.4.50.""

157
00:16:27,758 --> 00:16:30,318
""The market's opens today at Rs.4.50.""

158
00:16:30,394 --> 00:16:32,522
""Hurry up. Place your bids.""

159
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,308
""What's a Maharashtrian
doing in a Share Market.""

160
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:35,697
""Will you please move, sir.""

161
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:38,629
- ""Hey Marathi, where's my tea?""
- ""Coming, sir.""

162
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,502
- ""My money.""
- ""Money? What money?""

163
00:16:41,572 --> 00:16:43,563
- ""My money.""
- ""Get lost?""

164
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:46,110
- ""My money.""
- ""Get out of my face.""

165
00:16:46,511 --> 00:16:49,173
- ""My money.""
- ""Get out of my face.""

166
00:17:02,493 --> 00:17:04,484
Hey sonny boy.

167
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:05,528
Khan Sir?!

168
00:17:05,596 --> 00:17:08,031
You borrowed money from
me and are celebrating Diwali?

169
00:17:08,566 --> 00:17:11,058
And who's going to pay
interest for that money?

170
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:12,101
My money...

171
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:13,193
My money!

172
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:09,069
""Milk to the Bhaiyas (UP-Ians)""

173
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:10,437
""Idli (Rice Cake) to
the Annas (South Indians)""

174
00:18:10,461 --> 00:18:11,951
""Cinema to the Punjabis,.""

175
00:18:12,096 --> 00:18:13,096
""Tea to the Iranians,.""

176
00:18:13,297 --> 00:18:14,594
""Bakery to the Parsis,.""

177
00:18:14,665 --> 00:18:15,723
""Meat to the Muslims,""

178
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,468
'And yet this is a diverse India!'

179
00:18:18,002 --> 00:18:19,122
'They own the newspapers...'

180
00:18:19,236 --> 00:18:21,715
'...but they need a Maharashtrian
to deliver it from door to door.'

181
00:18:21,739 --> 00:18:23,002
'This is not done.'

182
00:18:23,574 --> 00:18:26,544
'We must show them that
Maharashtrians can be Ghati...'

183
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:28,101
'...but they are not cheap.'

184
00:18:30,081 --> 00:18:31,480
'You're an outsider.'

185
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:36,078
'Whereas Mumbai and Maharashtra
belong to the Maharashtrians .'

186
00:18:37,455 --> 00:18:38,479
Are you blind?

187
00:18:59,377 --> 00:19:00,970
You're not ready yet?

188
00:19:01,345 --> 00:19:03,006
It slipped my mind, but...

189
00:19:07,451 --> 00:19:08,451
I quit my job yesterday-

190
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,055
Isn't it enough that he told us today?

191
00:19:32,743 --> 00:19:33,972
Father.

192
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:39,343
So, what are planning to do next?

193
00:19:40,618 --> 00:19:43,280
I am thinking of starting
a weekly caricature magazine.

194
00:19:47,425 --> 00:19:48,620
Srikant will assist me.

195
00:19:52,396 --> 00:19:53,396
No need to worry.

196
00:19:53,998 --> 00:19:55,659
This runs in our blood.

197
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,590
Take me for instance.

198
00:19:57,668 --> 00:20:01,434
I kept others closer than my kin.

199
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,508
And earned everything in
this lifetime, except for money.

200
00:20:05,142 --> 00:20:08,669
But honestly,
all I can give you, is my blessings.

201
00:20:10,114 --> 00:20:11,240
What about the money?

202
00:20:28,532 --> 00:20:30,626
'What language is your magazine?'

203
00:20:30,701 --> 00:20:33,170
'You won't get a loan
for a Marathi magazine.'

204
00:20:33,204 --> 00:20:35,502
Hey, listen. This is not our policy.'

205
00:20:35,573 --> 00:20:36,597
'I am sorry, okay.'

206
00:20:36,674 --> 00:20:40,235
'We want to stay in the market.
Not go out of business.'

207
00:20:42,113 --> 00:20:43,774
'What about the mortgage?'

208
00:20:44,048 --> 00:20:46,312
'Marathi Magazine.
Who is going to read it?'

209
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:47,417
Two...

210
00:20:47,451 --> 00:20:49,510
Gopal, you're heading to Gaay Wadi,
aren't you?

211
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:50,587
Yes, brother.

212
00:20:51,088 --> 00:20:52,522
Keep these in the storeroom.

213
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,751
Take these along as well.

214
00:20:53,824 --> 00:20:55,588
And don't forget to collect the money.

215
00:20:57,261 --> 00:20:58,558
Please come in.

216
00:20:59,163 --> 00:21:00,062
Greetings.

217
00:21:00,097 --> 00:21:02,361
- How are you, Bajirao?
- Fine.

218
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:03,764
What brings you here, Bal?

219
00:21:04,401 --> 00:21:06,301
We're thinking about
starting a Weekly Magazine.

220
00:21:06,337 --> 00:21:07,337
I see.

221
00:21:07,404 --> 00:21:09,668
We've been to numerous banks, but...

222
00:21:10,207 --> 00:21:12,291
I am sure father told you everything...

223
00:21:12,316 --> 00:21:13,177
Yes, he did.

224
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,268
We'll...

225
00:21:17,448 --> 00:21:18,779
need some money.

226
00:21:19,316 --> 00:21:20,340
How much do you want'?

227
00:21:21,218 --> 00:21:22,218
5,000

228
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,115
5, 000?

229
00:21:23,187 --> 00:21:24,227
But, we'll return it soon.

230
00:21:25,122 --> 00:21:26,590
5,000...

231
00:21:26,724 --> 00:21:27,418
5,000

232
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:29,220
How is Prabodhankar?

233
00:21:30,594 --> 00:21:31,594
He's fine.

234
00:21:32,763 --> 00:21:33,763
Here you go?

235
00:21:34,598 --> 00:21:35,598
Here you go?

236
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:37,133
Count it.

237
00:21:38,068 --> 00:21:39,068
And two more...

238
00:21:40,638 --> 00:21:41,638
Here you go.

239
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,544
Uncle, this is 5,200.

240
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,900
Here's your 200 rupees back.

241
00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:53,569
We'll need your blessings, Uncle.

242
00:21:54,518 --> 00:21:56,748
It should start with a bang.

243
00:21:57,822 --> 00:22:00,182
What did you say you are
going to call your Weekly Magazine?

244
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:16,462
On this auspicious occasion,

245
00:22:17,174 --> 00:22:21,338
I would like to request
the Chief Minister of Maharashtra...

246
00:22:22,246 --> 00:22:29,551
Mr. Yeshwant Rao Chauhan,
to inaugurate 'Marmik' (Poignant)!

247
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:52,167
A Respected Speaker, Photographer,

248
00:22:53,277 --> 00:22:54,277
Writer,

249
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:55,545
Teacher,

250
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,280
Editor...

251
00:22:58,449 --> 00:23:04,479
and the holder of many more such
titles and honor and my dear friend...

252
00:23:05,222 --> 00:23:08,248
Mr. Prabhodhankar's
son has started 'Marmik'.

253
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:11,226
And I am extremely delighted about it.

254
00:23:11,528 --> 00:23:15,522
After seeing the cover
page of 'Marmik' I am assured...

255
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:23,437
that it will only add to
my friend Prabhodhankar's glory.

256
00:23:25,242 --> 00:23:26,573
In fact, this issue is so good...

257
00:23:26,744 --> 00:23:30,374
that pretty soon the citizen
of Maharashtra will address him...

258
00:23:30,447 --> 00:23:32,211
as the father of Bal Thackeray.

259
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,352
Although the magazine is
named 'Marmik'...

260
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:42,157
but its humor is pretty sharp.

261
00:23:42,526 --> 00:23:43,526
And serious.

262
00:23:44,628 --> 00:23:47,359
One can deduce all that
by simply watching the cover page.

263
00:23:48,032 --> 00:23:52,162
And I can only hope that 'Marmik'
will be read in every home...

264
00:23:52,336 --> 00:23:54,703
- in Maharashtra.
- Wait, I am coming too.

265
00:24:10,487 --> 00:24:13,252
You can't even sleep
peacefully around here.

266
00:24:14,158 --> 00:24:17,651
Why in the world did he
have to move the board around?

267
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:19,685
Stupid.

268
00:24:28,172 --> 00:24:29,435
Yes, I am Thackeray!

269
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:33,075
After reading my articles
and seeing my cartoons...

270
00:24:33,143 --> 00:24:34,903
you all must be wondering
who is this man?

271
00:24:35,412 --> 00:24:37,176
The wrong guy who tells the truth.

272
00:24:37,715 --> 00:24:39,183
Is he some gangster?

273
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,431
If being outright honest is a crime,
then I am a criminal.

274
00:24:43,454 --> 00:24:46,515
I would rather snatch my rights
then beg for them like an a****!

275
00:24:51,695 --> 00:24:54,255
A man's strength and courage...

276
00:24:54,331 --> 00:24:56,356
is not measured by
the size of his chest.

277
00:24:58,502 --> 00:25:00,231
His strength lies in his mind...

278
00:25:00,304 --> 00:25:01,784
which we have leased it to others.

279
00:25:02,406 --> 00:25:05,006
Then may it be the Mughals...
the British, or any other Outsiders.

280
00:25:07,478 --> 00:25:10,311
We just stand there with our hands
folded, like we don't have a spine.

281
00:25:11,315 --> 00:25:12,373
Saluting them...

282
00:25:14,251 --> 00:25:15,309
Salutations Anna.

283
00:25:15,386 --> 00:25:16,285
Salutations Penna.

284
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,320
Salutations lyer.

285
00:25:17,354 --> 00:25:18,354
Am I right, Uncle?

286
00:25:20,157 --> 00:25:21,634
If you're our guest,
we've respect and honor for you...

287
00:25:21,658 --> 00:25:23,183
and welcome you with open arms.

288
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,096
But if someone tries to take our jobs,
and steal our food...

289
00:25:27,364 --> 00:25:29,244
then we can raise
These folded hands as well.

290
00:25:33,704 --> 00:25:36,332
And we're done folding hands,
It's time we broke their arms.

291
00:25:37,074 --> 00:25:38,318
We're done giving
them respect and honor.

292
00:25:38,342 --> 00:25:39,241
Did you hear?

293
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:40,469
Does violence solve anything?

294
00:25:41,412 --> 00:25:44,507
These bloody South Indians...

295
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,711
They are always together.

296
00:25:48,385 --> 00:25:49,318
They drink together.

297
00:25:49,386 --> 00:25:50,751
They help each other in business.

298
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:53,821
And we spend most of our lives doing
more harm than good to each other.

299
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,251
You can stay if you like,
but I am leaving.

300
00:25:59,196 --> 00:26:00,357
We'll show him tomorrow.

301
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,333
They hire their own people
even to clean their dishes.

302
00:26:07,204 --> 00:26:10,265
And when one of us starts a business,
do you know what we say?

303
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:14,073
""Less salt. Less oil.""

304
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,512
When are you going to rekindle
that fire in your heart?

305
00:26:21,218 --> 00:26:22,549
We're done felicitating them.

306
00:26:23,687 --> 00:26:25,587
Its time to strike, where it hurts!

307
00:26:27,658 --> 00:26:31,390
It's how he started,
by giving provocative speeches.

308
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:35,465
Provoking younger generations,
sparking riots, that was his...

309
00:26:35,532 --> 00:26:37,193
Can you do something
about the loud noise?

310
00:26:37,668 --> 00:26:38,668
What?

311
00:26:39,436 --> 00:26:41,700
Can you do something about
the loud noise from the fan?

312
00:26:43,774 --> 00:26:45,538
Order! Order! Order!

313
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,007
Turn this fan off.

314
00:26:53,417 --> 00:26:56,011
When things go bad,
they make a lot of noise.

315
00:26:57,454 --> 00:26:58,478
How old are you'?

316
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:00,200
What kind of a pointless
question is that?

317
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,487
But still, what is your age?

318
00:27:05,462 --> 00:27:06,258
35 years old.

319
00:27:06,396 --> 00:27:07,396
35 years old.

320
00:27:08,432 --> 00:27:10,696
At the age of 35, you're a lawyer,

321
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:13,563
You're representing the CBI in court.

322
00:27:14,104 --> 00:27:15,104
And that's good.

323
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:20,434
But you are standing here today
because you received good education.

324
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:28,213
But when someone more educated than you can't
afford one square meal for his family...

325
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:31,511
then you realize the
true meaning of hunger.

326
00:27:32,623 --> 00:27:34,455
And when you've no
means to douse that fire...

327
00:27:34,992 --> 00:27:37,273
it in-turn burns the entire
society down to the ground.

328
00:27:37,628 --> 00:27:40,029
Silence, please! Silence!

329
00:27:42,132 --> 00:27:44,362
You've always been
a supporter of violence.

330
00:27:44,434 --> 00:27:44,764
Definitely not.

331
00:27:45,035 --> 00:27:47,355
Obviously, there will always be
a reaction to every action.

332
00:27:47,638 --> 00:27:49,436
Only Marathi signboards allowed.

333
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,535
Rice cakes... Pancakes... Crepes...

334
00:27:54,611 --> 00:27:56,705
Strike, where it hurts!

335
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,579
Strike, where it hurts!

336
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,516
These people deserve this.

337
00:28:01,618 --> 00:28:02,618
Exactly!

338
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,947
These outsiders take our jobs.

339
00:28:07,691 --> 00:28:10,524
Everyone single one of
them needs to be thrashed.

340
00:28:11,962 --> 00:28:12,962
This isn't right.

341
00:28:14,064 --> 00:28:15,691
You think violence will get us jobs?

342
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:17,733
Ae...

343
00:28:18,468 --> 00:28:22,427
Every day, you wear your tie and wander from
pillar to post, but did you get a job yet?

344
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,208
'You didn't, did you?'

345
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:27,062
'And you are never going to find one.'

346
00:28:27,611 --> 00:28:32,378
'If we still do nothing,
these outsiders will sc*** us.'

347
00:28:33,317 --> 00:28:37,618
'We will get jobs when their
glasses come shattering down.'

348
00:28:38,288 --> 00:28:39,983
'No vacancy.'

349
00:28:40,023 --> 00:28:41,218
Not qualified.

350
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:43,259
'...that's what you're fit for.'

351
00:28:43,327 --> 00:28:45,455
'... no qualification, no job.'

352
00:28:45,629 --> 00:28:51,068
'They are not qualified
enough to get a job.'

353
00:28:51,168 --> 00:28:54,365
'But, if you know a maid,
then, send her over to my house.'

354
00:28:54,438 --> 00:28:57,408
'No, we don't employ Maharashtrians .'

355
00:29:07,551 --> 00:29:09,076
The glass is broken.

356
00:29:09,152 --> 00:29:11,052
- Oh no...
- Run! Run!

357
00:29:11,154 --> 00:29:12,365
Why did you hit it so hard, uncle?

358
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:13,389
Oh, Lord...

359
00:29:13,624 --> 00:29:14,955
What's going on down there?

360
00:29:15,025 --> 00:29:16,151
Stop playing Cricket.

361
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,689
And, who broke the glass?

362
00:29:17,961 --> 00:29:19,122
It wasn't me.

363
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:21,491
It was sir.

364
00:29:21,565 --> 00:29:23,192
No, I did not. Such a tattle-teller.

365
00:29:23,267 --> 00:29:24,598
You're too much.

366
00:29:26,036 --> 00:29:28,266
The broken glass has
scattered all over the place.

367
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:30,405
Who's going to clean this up now?

368
00:29:30,674 --> 00:29:33,006
Come on, let us play.

369
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:36,674
You're just too much.

370
00:29:38,682 --> 00:29:40,013
Ball...

371
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,642
- Out. Out. You're out.
- No, I am not.

372
00:29:41,718 --> 00:29:43,083
That was a six.

373
00:29:43,153 --> 00:29:44,273
- That was a six.
- Out. Out.

374
00:29:44,421 --> 00:29:45,354
I am not giving up the bat.

375
00:29:45,422 --> 00:29:46,753
Come on, Come on.

376
00:29:47,024 --> 00:29:48,423
He's not going to give up the bat.

377
00:29:49,026 --> 00:29:50,221
Come on, let's play.

378
00:29:50,427 --> 00:29:51,588
You PlayÂ».

379
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,191
And I clean up this mess.

380
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,729
Wait. I'll check.

381
00:30:03,507 --> 00:30:04,565
Wait a minute.

382
00:30:05,742 --> 00:30:06,742
What do you want?

383
00:30:07,444 --> 00:30:09,071
- I want to meet Thackeray.
- What for?

384
00:30:09,146 --> 00:30:10,146
Duttaji...

385
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,676
I am Bal Thackeray.

386
00:30:14,785 --> 00:30:17,305
Shall I come down to your Police
Station, or can we talk inside?

387
00:30:19,489 --> 00:30:20,547
We'll come inside.

388
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:22,383
Come.

389
00:30:22,592 --> 00:30:23,753
Let's go inside.

390
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:25,754
Let the kids play outside.

391
00:30:26,463 --> 00:30:27,463
Come in.

392
00:30:45,682 --> 00:30:49,482
Your speeches have caused a great deal
of loss to the South Indian community.

393
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,940
We've received a number of complaints.

394
00:30:52,055 --> 00:30:53,489
Those complaints are against me.

395
00:30:53,557 --> 00:30:55,168
You should have arrested me.
Why come all the way...

396
00:30:55,192 --> 00:30:58,059
- So... you're here to arrest me.

397
00:30:58,128 --> 00:30:59,128
No.

398
00:30:59,796 --> 00:31:01,560
The Udupi Hotels have
suffered huge losses.

399
00:31:01,765 --> 00:31:04,291
We must file a case
against a couple of people.

400
00:31:04,468 --> 00:31:07,597
You Know... we've to deal
with tremendous pressure.

401
00:31:08,071 --> 00:31:10,130
And even our seniors are outsiders.

402
00:31:10,741 --> 00:31:13,540
But, I like your method...

403
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,578
which is why I wanted
to meet you first.

404
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:19,671
You know we can't take
sides because of this uniform.

405
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:24,284
These outsiders come
to our state and rule over us...

406
00:31:24,354 --> 00:31:25,354
I know all about it.

407
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:27,743
I've been through it myself.

408
00:31:29,693 --> 00:31:31,183
I'll have to make a report.

409
00:31:31,461 --> 00:31:33,623
But you won't face any problems.

410
00:31:35,298 --> 00:31:36,298
See you.

411
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,601
Good bye.

412
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,330
Good bye.

413
00:31:41,371 --> 00:31:42,371
Let's go.

414
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:48,500
But sir, DCP sir sent
us here to investigate.

415
00:31:49,246 --> 00:31:52,705
Shinde, when one of us
is thinking about our benefit...

416
00:31:52,749 --> 00:31:56,481
then you don't investigate him,
you think about his comfort.

417
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,259
Marmik's latest edition.

418
00:32:04,327 --> 00:32:05,488
Read and Do nothing about it!

419
00:32:05,562 --> 00:32:06,586
Give me One Marmik.

420
00:32:16,506 --> 00:32:17,234
Marmik.

421
00:32:17,307 --> 00:32:18,103
Marmik's latest edition.

422
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,437
Read and Do nothing about it!

423
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:21,102
Marmik's latest edition.

424
00:32:21,178 --> 00:32:22,703
Read and Do nothing about it!

425
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,220
What?

426
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,479
- Is Thackeray sir at home?
- Yes.

427
00:32:33,757 --> 00:32:34,690
- Grandpa.
- Yes.

428
00:32:34,724 --> 00:32:37,352
- Someone here to see you.
- Who is it?

429
00:32:49,272 --> 00:32:53,038
- Yes? What do you want?
- Are you Mr. Bala Sahab Thackeray?

430
00:32:53,777 --> 00:32:55,142
<i>Mr. Baa Sahab.</i>

431
00:32:55,445 --> 00:32:57,140
Yes, he's here.

432
00:32:57,514 --> 00:32:58,811
Bala Sahab is at home.

433
00:32:59,082 --> 00:33:00,106
Let me call you.

434
00:33:00,183 --> 00:33:01,617
<i>Baa Sahab...</i>

435
00:33:02,986 --> 00:33:04,681
Someone here to see you.

436
00:33:04,988 --> 00:33:06,012
Father...

437
00:33:07,691 --> 00:33:08,385
Yes.

438
00:33:08,592 --> 00:33:10,082
You're doing a good job.

439
00:33:11,027 --> 00:33:13,655
We always knew that Maharashtrians
were being exploited...

440
00:33:14,764 --> 00:33:16,698
but now we know who the exploiters are.

441
00:33:17,534 --> 00:33:21,198
Sir, this is a list of the
outsiders in our office.

442
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,044
I would like to work with you, Sir.

443
00:33:34,084 --> 00:33:38,385
Sir, 10 days have passed. And my
daughter hasn't returned home yet.

444
00:33:39,055 --> 00:33:41,752
They say they got married and that too,
to a Muslim.

445
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:44,225
And they are living at Bhindi Bazaar.

446
00:33:44,761 --> 00:33:48,197
I beg of you, please
bring her back home.

447
00:33:48,298 --> 00:33:51,734
I've been struggling, for the
past 7 years for a water connection.

448
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:55,094
When he returns from the loo,
he keeps the in front of my house.

449
00:33:55,171 --> 00:33:56,691
I am not going to listen every time...

450
00:33:57,307 --> 00:33:58,307
So I dropped him.

451
00:33:58,341 --> 00:34:01,538
Bal, what's your stand
on this current situation?

452
00:34:01,611 --> 00:34:04,979
My wife hasn't been keeping well.

453
00:34:05,048 --> 00:34:07,676
You always speak against democracy.

454
00:34:07,717 --> 00:34:09,276
This is my area, that one's theirs...

455
00:34:09,352 --> 00:34:11,252
I am taking him back
only on your order.

456
00:34:11,321 --> 00:34:13,187
If you can make a call to DCP sir...

457
00:34:13,256 --> 00:34:15,190
There's a huge prayer
meet in our society.

458
00:34:18,762 --> 00:34:20,526
Don't you believe in Democracy?

459
00:34:20,597 --> 00:34:21,917
I will punch him, then and there!

460
00:34:22,032 --> 00:34:23,032
As well as free food.

461
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:24,744
You should publish
this in the Marmik once.

462
00:34:24,768 --> 00:34:26,463
You must do something about him.

463
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,080
And, I am saying this
pretty much in advance...

464
00:34:28,104 --> 00:34:29,663
I'll get transferred immediately.

465
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:32,436
But if he comes home drunk again,
then I will...

466
00:34:33,009 --> 00:34:37,446
Wouldn't it be right to say
what you're doing is also hooliganism?

467
00:34:38,114 --> 00:34:40,794
Are you going to keep dealing
with their problems at here at home...

468
00:34:41,117 --> 00:34:44,143
or, have you thought about starting
a different organization for them?

469
00:34:45,121 --> 00:34:45,713
Yes, father.

470
00:34:46,122 --> 00:34:47,122
At least not at home.

471
00:34:48,158 --> 00:34:51,398
But, in order to work for the benefit of
the people, I'll have to go amongst them.

472
00:34:53,763 --> 00:34:55,094
We must bring them together.

473
00:34:56,066 --> 00:35:01,061
And for that,
we must build an organization.

474
00:35:02,072 --> 00:35:04,973
For the Marathis,
for Mumbai, for Maharashtra.

475
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,339
Then what are you waiting for?

476
00:35:09,479 --> 00:35:10,571
Sooner the better.

477
00:35:11,281 --> 00:35:13,306
- Ramesh, go get a coconut.
- Okay.

478
00:35:15,085 --> 00:35:17,144
Sister-in-law,
you arrived at the right occasion.

479
00:35:17,554 --> 00:35:18,554
Occasion?

480
00:35:19,255 --> 00:35:20,255
What occasion?

481
00:35:20,423 --> 00:35:21,703
For building a new organization.

482
00:35:22,158 --> 00:35:23,158
I see.

483
00:35:23,693 --> 00:35:24,319
That's great.

484
00:35:24,394 --> 00:35:26,761
Sister-in-law, send some sweets.

485
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,293
Okay.

486
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:32,499
We've decided to build
a new organization.

487
00:35:34,371 --> 00:35:37,773
But... what will we be the name
of the new organization?

488
00:35:38,008 --> 00:35:39,048
Have you thought about it?

489
00:35:39,342 --> 00:35:41,709
Name? Well, the name...

490
00:35:43,279 --> 00:35:45,145
I haven't thought
anything about the name?

491
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,549
Father, why don't you suggest
a name for the organization?

492
00:35:50,687 --> 00:35:51,687
What organization?

493
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,281
We'll lead an army.

494
00:35:57,427 --> 00:36:00,362
Take the name of King
Shivaji Maharaj and go ahead.

495
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:06,233
- Glory to...
- Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj!

496
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:11,969
- Glory to...
- Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj!

497
00:36:12,108 --> 00:36:16,409
- Glory to...
- Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj!

498
00:36:16,513 --> 00:36:21,144
- Glory to...
- Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj!

499
00:36:30,427 --> 00:36:34,364
- Hail Bhawani!
- Hail Shivaji!

500
00:36:34,464 --> 00:36:38,025
- Hail Bhawani!
- Hail Shivaji!

501
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:43,005
- Long live...
- Shiv... Sena!

502
00:36:43,106 --> 00:36:47,373
- Long live...
- Shiv... Sena!

503
00:36:47,444 --> 00:36:50,038
- Glory to...
- Mahadev...

504
00:36:50,146 --> 00:36:54,310
- Long live...
- Shiv... Sena!

505
00:36:55,185 --> 00:37:00,646
Real men don't talk about compromise.

506
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:03,984
These are words are used by weaklings.

507
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:15,061
And this state of Maharashtra,
ls not a state of weaklings.

508
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:18,007
We're tigers.

509
00:37:21,444 --> 00:37:25,540
And whenever someone
tries to rattle a tiger...

510
00:37:26,049 --> 00:37:32,113
history has been a witness
of their consequences!

511
00:37:34,724 --> 00:37:35,724
<i>Baâ.!</i>

512
00:37:50,073 --> 00:37:54,032
My son here,
till today, was just a Thackeray.

513
00:37:54,444 --> 00:37:59,041
But now, this Bal
belongs to entire Maharashtra.

514
00:37:59,783 --> 00:38:02,343
I pledge him to the unified India.

515
00:38:02,418 --> 00:38:05,217
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

516
00:38:05,288 --> 00:38:08,019
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

517
00:38:08,057 --> 00:38:11,425
- Hail Bhawani!
- Hail Shivaji!

518
00:38:12,095 --> 00:38:16,191
To control the outsiders' intrude.

519
00:38:16,299 --> 00:38:20,133
Soon we will begin with
the enrollment for 'Shiv Sena'.

520
00:38:20,303 --> 00:38:22,203
Read the next edition of Marmik...

521
00:38:22,272 --> 00:38:24,138
for more information.

522
00:38:24,207 --> 00:38:27,006
Editor, Mr. Bal Thackeray.

523
00:38:33,516 --> 00:38:36,247
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

524
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:39,311
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

525
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:42,188
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

526
00:38:42,258 --> 00:38:44,590
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

527
00:38:44,661 --> 00:38:46,561
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

528
00:38:46,629 --> 00:38:49,326
- Glory to...
- Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj!

529
00:38:49,399 --> 00:38:52,425
- Glory to...
- Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj!

530
00:38:52,502 --> 00:38:55,631
- Glory to...
- Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj!

531
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,509
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

532
00:38:59,576 --> 00:39:02,204
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

533
00:39:02,278 --> 00:39:04,542
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

534
00:39:04,581 --> 00:39:06,515
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

535
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:09,211
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

536
00:39:09,285 --> 00:39:11,151
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

537
00:39:11,221 --> 00:39:13,713
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

538
00:39:14,557 --> 00:39:17,185
Uncle. Have a sweet?

539
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,661
Sir, please help me.

540
00:39:20,363 --> 00:39:21,159
What happened?

541
00:39:21,264 --> 00:39:26,065
You know, we've been in the milk business
since the time of our forefathers.

542
00:39:26,536 --> 00:39:28,336
I spent my hard earned
fortune to buy a house.

543
00:39:29,272 --> 00:39:30,967
2 years ago I rented the place out...

544
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,100
but, now they are refusing
to vacate the place.

545
00:39:33,142 --> 00:39:34,142
They?

546
00:39:34,277 --> 00:39:35,277
Who?

547
00:39:35,445 --> 00:39:36,445
He's some goon.

548
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:38,473
He's running a gambling den there.

549
00:39:39,616 --> 00:39:43,610
I went to reason with him,
but... he says we're 'His' men.

550
00:39:44,254 --> 00:39:45,254
""His""?

551
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:46,989
Who's He?

552
00:39:49,726 --> 00:39:50,726
<i>Baa Saheb.</i>

553
00:39:58,501 --> 00:40:01,732
Wait here, uncle. I'll talk to Sir.

554
00:40:04,741 --> 00:40:05,606
Move. Move.

555
00:40:05,675 --> 00:40:08,474
Sir, someone has forcefully
taken possession of his house.

556
00:40:09,145 --> 00:40:12,672
And they claim that they are ""our"" men.

557
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:15,408
- Note down his address.
- Yes, sir.

558
00:40:17,687 --> 00:40:18,449
Come, uncle.

559
00:40:18,521 --> 00:40:19,613
Give me the address.

560
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:23,625
Hand me a pen.

561
00:40:27,196 --> 00:40:28,686
Sutarwadi, Room no. 19.

562
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:32,327
Sir, this is a list of our nominees.

563
00:40:33,069 --> 00:40:34,069
Sir...

564
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:40,409
- Is this okay?
- Yes.

565
00:40:41,611 --> 00:40:45,809
Sir, are we contesting for
the Corporation elections?

566
00:40:46,082 --> 00:40:47,106
Yes, so?

567
00:40:48,117 --> 00:40:51,357
Are we going to be holding demonstrations
and picketing for the rest of our lives?

568
00:40:52,522 --> 00:40:55,355
How long are we going to
rally behind these Corporators'?

569
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,293
Now our Soldiers' will
become Corporators themselves...

570
00:41:00,363 --> 00:41:02,003
and work for the benefit of the people.

571
00:41:02,398 --> 00:41:04,992
But Sir, you never told us anything.

572
00:41:05,301 --> 00:41:06,301
Well, I just did.

573
00:41:08,237 --> 00:41:09,237
Now get to work.

574
00:41:14,377 --> 00:41:15,377
Sir...

575
00:41:18,181 --> 00:41:20,149
I am really indebted to you.

576
00:41:20,783 --> 00:41:24,777
Someone who troubles the
weak can never be one of us.

577
00:41:25,355 --> 00:41:26,220
Hail Maharashtra!

578
00:41:26,289 --> 00:41:27,289
Hail Maharashtra!

579
00:41:30,426 --> 00:41:31,426
Hail Maharashtra!

580
00:41:38,668 --> 00:41:41,569
- Hello?
- Hello. May I speak with Bala Saheb?

581
00:41:42,205 --> 00:41:45,140
- Who is this?
- Sister-in-law, this is Manohar Joshi.

582
00:41:46,409 --> 00:41:47,467
Just a minute.

583
00:41:47,744 --> 00:41:48,744
Joshi.

584
00:41:50,346 --> 00:41:51,438
Go ahead.

585
00:41:51,481 --> 00:41:55,145
Sir, Balwant Mane from our party...

586
00:41:55,218 --> 00:41:56,218
Speak freely.

587
00:41:56,486 --> 00:41:58,614
Sir, he...

588
00:41:59,155 --> 00:42:00,520
I said to speak freely.

589
00:42:01,124 --> 00:42:06,654
He's called for a meeting,
at Manwali Hall, at 5:30.

590
00:42:08,598 --> 00:42:11,033
Against... you.

591
00:42:12,402 --> 00:42:14,131
He's also distributing circulars.

592
00:42:15,605 --> 00:42:17,300
We must do something about him.

593
00:42:17,373 --> 00:42:18,373
Okay.

594
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:21,309
Okay.

595
00:42:25,748 --> 00:42:29,480
Our party's plan of action should
be decided with everyone's approval.

596
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,754
It's crucial to have
democracy within the party.

597
00:42:33,456 --> 00:42:38,018
We won't let Shiv Sena
be controlled by a handful few.

598
00:42:38,127 --> 00:42:39,338
We won't tolerate dictatorship.

599
00:42:39,362 --> 00:42:41,160
We won't...

600
00:42:41,731 --> 00:42:43,324
Let's show him.

601
00:42:43,399 --> 00:42:45,458
No! No! Leave me.

602
00:42:45,601 --> 00:42:47,467
Show him.

603
00:42:47,537 --> 00:42:50,598
No. Leave me.

604
00:42:58,514 --> 00:43:00,744
How dare you speak against Sir?

605
00:43:02,051 --> 00:43:06,181
Sir. Sir.

606
00:43:06,489 --> 00:43:09,584
I don't believe in petty democracy...

607
00:43:15,465 --> 00:43:16,728
in this Organization.

608
00:43:16,999 --> 00:43:19,058
So, are you against Democracy?

609
00:43:19,702 --> 00:43:21,295
Where is Democracy?

610
00:43:23,306 --> 00:43:25,026
Which Democracy are
you talking about to me?

611
00:43:27,677 --> 00:43:30,009
According to me,
only two types of democracy exist.

612
00:43:30,513 --> 00:43:33,039
One, where you stay
quiet and endure everything.

613
00:43:33,749 --> 00:43:36,069
Or the one where you don't
stay quiet and raise your voice.

614
00:43:36,486 --> 00:43:37,544
Fight!

615
00:43:37,687 --> 00:43:41,021
For your rights, and for justice.

616
00:43:43,326 --> 00:43:48,230
If the Law of this country is equal for
everyone, and everyone's treated equally...

617
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:54,466
and Democracy has one view for everyone, then
why wouldn't I believe in this Democracy?

618
00:43:56,439 --> 00:43:58,771
I agree different religions
have different Laws here.

619
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:04,240
If Democracy treats everyone the same way,
then why wouldn't I believe in Democracy?

620
00:44:04,313 --> 00:44:05,576
Even I believed in Democracy.

621
00:44:09,352 --> 00:44:14,449
When Kashmiri Pandits were driven out
of Kashmir, where was this Democracy?

622
00:44:15,591 --> 00:44:17,025
Isn't Kashmir a part of us?

623
00:44:19,529 --> 00:44:21,293
Aren't Kashmiri Pandits one of us?

624
00:44:23,633 --> 00:44:28,002
The water of Sutlej is causing
mutiny between Punjab and Haryana.

625
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,102
Even today the Marathi people
of Belgaum and Karwar...

626
00:44:35,211 --> 00:44:38,146
are demonstrating
to be a part of Maharashtra.

627
00:44:40,016 --> 00:44:46,319
Our Mumbai itself needed the sacrifice of
106 people to be a part of Maharashtra.

628
00:44:48,157 --> 00:44:49,784
Where was your democracy, then?

629
00:44:50,626 --> 00:44:53,493
How many more sacrifices will
it need in order to Keep it alive'?

630
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,137
We celebrate Republic
Day on 26th January.

631
00:45:02,271 --> 00:45:06,572
Where was your democracy
on one such 26th January?

632
00:45:06,642 --> 00:45:13,014
When countless
innocent lives was lost...

633
00:45:13,249 --> 00:45:16,446
Maharashtra should be a unified
state along with Belgaum and Karwar.

634
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:20,556
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray!

635
00:45:20,623 --> 00:45:24,560
- We want...
- Unified Maharashtra.

636
00:45:24,627 --> 00:45:27,028
We give an ultimatum
until 26th January.

637
00:45:28,264 --> 00:45:30,323
If the Belgaum issue
isn't solved until then...

638
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,960
then we warn the Chief
Minister of Maharashtra,

639
00:45:33,102 --> 00:45:35,822
Home Minister of the country, and
the Vice President Morarji Desai...

640
00:45:36,038 --> 00:45:38,598
that leave alone Mumbai,

641
00:45:41,077 --> 00:45:43,557
they will not be allowed even
within the limits of Maharashtra.

642
00:45:45,615 --> 00:45:48,175
Who does Thackeray
think he is, to put a ban on me?

643
00:45:49,352 --> 00:45:53,653
Mr. Yeshwant Rao, my tour
of Bombay will continue as scheduled.

644
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:56,615
Leave no dearth in your arrangements.

645
00:45:57,793 --> 00:46:01,525
Sir, his goons even
stopped his oar in Mumbai.

646
00:46:03,633 --> 00:46:06,261
There's excessive anger
amongst the people of Maharashtra.

647
00:46:07,336 --> 00:46:11,671
The people of Belgaum and
Karwar have come out on the streets.

648
00:46:11,741 --> 00:46:15,609
The decisions taken in the interest
of the country must be followed.

649
00:46:16,479 --> 00:46:19,505
If someone takes a decision
against the Government...

650
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:22,869
then he will be dealt with
in the language best known to him.

651
00:46:25,121 --> 00:46:26,282
If he fails to behave,

652
00:46:26,355 --> 00:46:29,075
then the Government will not
hold back in showing it's true power.

653
00:46:29,425 --> 00:46:31,587
Take utmost strict action if need be.

654
00:46:32,128 --> 00:46:36,395
Also, he is the one who inaugurated Bal
Thackeray's Weekly Magazine.

655
00:46:39,402 --> 00:46:41,234
Who does he really think he is?

656
00:46:44,707 --> 00:46:47,506
Gentlemen,
I don't care about any of this.

657
00:46:47,576 --> 00:46:48,702
I am coming to Bombay.

658
00:46:49,745 --> 00:46:51,440
Do whatever is necessary.

659
00:46:53,215 --> 00:46:54,649
Who is in charge of the Police?

660
00:46:54,717 --> 00:46:55,717
Modak.

661
00:46:56,252 --> 00:46:57,481
Is he a Maharashtrian?

662
00:46:57,553 --> 00:46:59,681
No, just a Maharashtrian surname.

663
00:47:00,189 --> 00:47:03,955
His full name is Emanuel Modak.

664
00:47:04,093 --> 00:47:06,425
Dutta Salvi. This is my last warning.

665
00:47:06,729 --> 00:47:08,094
Tell Mr. Thackeray...

666
00:47:08,497 --> 00:47:11,258
that I don't want to see any
of his boys anywhere near Mr. Morarji.

667
00:47:12,101 --> 00:47:13,101
His boys?

668
00:47:13,703 --> 00:47:17,298
Bala Saheb is personally going
to hand over his appeal to Mr. Morarji.

669
00:47:17,406 --> 00:47:20,103
So Mr. Morarji better
collect it personally.

670
00:47:20,409 --> 00:47:21,535
We have only one demand.

671
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:25,444
Belgaum, Karwar, is a part of Maharashtra,
still is, and always will be.

672
00:47:25,514 --> 00:47:26,538
Lower your voice.

673
00:47:26,615 --> 00:47:28,460
Don't forget you're talking
to a Deputy Commissioner.

674
00:47:28,484 --> 00:47:29,383
Understand.

675
00:47:29,485 --> 00:47:33,649
This is the lowest my voice can get.

676
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:35,290
<i>Outta...</i>

677
00:47:36,158 --> 00:47:37,169
Do you see how he's misbehaving'?

678
00:47:37,193 --> 00:47:38,126
What do you mean misbehaving?

679
00:47:38,194 --> 00:47:40,754
- Duttaji it'll be fine, just calm down.
- But...

680
00:47:43,032 --> 00:47:47,196
Look, sir, we want to hand
over this request very peacefully.

681
00:47:47,503 --> 00:47:48,503
Peacefully.

682
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:53,168
You just deliver our message to him,
that's all.

683
00:47:53,242 --> 00:47:55,682
But the Law and Order on that
day will be your responsibility.

684
00:47:55,745 --> 00:47:57,179
Fine, we'll see.

685
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:58,460
What do you mean we'll see?

686
00:47:58,614 --> 00:48:03,074
Well, it means that, if he accepts our request,
then Law and Order will be maintained.

687
00:48:03,152 --> 00:48:04,152
Yes.

688
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:08,390
Fine.

689
00:48:11,193 --> 00:48:12,683
I will convey your message to him.

690
00:48:13,729 --> 00:48:14,729
Thank you, sir.

691
00:48:14,964 --> 00:48:15,964
See you.

692
00:48:19,702 --> 00:48:23,536
- Why did you have to fold your hands?
- These things are necessary.

693
00:48:27,209 --> 00:48:29,701
Our Saheb shall personally
handover the appeal tomorrow.

694
00:48:29,979 --> 00:48:33,040
And Morarji must accept
it personally... understood.

695
00:48:33,082 --> 00:48:35,073
- And don't you forget it.
- Let's go, uncle...

696
00:48:37,987 --> 00:48:40,752
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb!

697
00:48:41,023 --> 00:48:43,993
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb!

698
00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:45,390
Back! Stay back!

699
00:48:45,461 --> 00:48:46,758
- Glory to...
- Bala Saheb!

700
00:48:47,029 --> 00:48:51,466
- We want...
- We want Unified Maharashtra!

701
00:48:51,534 --> 00:48:55,630
- We want...
- We want Unified Maharashtra!

702
00:48:55,704 --> 00:49:00,471
- We want...
- We want Unified Maharashtra!

703
00:49:00,543 --> 00:49:03,638
- Go back...
- Morarji Go back!

704
00:49:03,712 --> 00:49:07,444
- Go back...
- Morarji Go back!

705
00:49:07,516 --> 00:49:11,111
- Go back...
- Morarji Go back!

706
00:49:11,187 --> 00:49:14,714
- Go back...
- Morarji Go back!

707
00:49:33,576 --> 00:49:36,307
If the cavalcade doesn't stop,
even we won't stay quiet.

708
00:50:05,107 --> 00:50:07,132
Saheb, what now?

709
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:09,441
Attention!

710
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,651
The convoy won't stop.

711
00:50:19,688 --> 00:50:20,688
Stop them!

712
00:50:21,524 --> 00:50:22,286
Stop.

713
00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:25,794
Saheb! They are saying that
Morarji's convoy won't stop here!

714
00:50:26,061 --> 00:50:29,224
Saheb, they are saying
that he won't accept the request!

715
00:50:39,742 --> 00:50:42,109
Stay back. Stay back.

716
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,047
Move. I said move.

717
00:50:53,088 --> 00:50:54,283
Sir, get in the car.

718
00:50:54,356 --> 00:50:56,484
Move. Move aside.

719
00:50:56,592 --> 00:50:58,720
- Forget about me, stop them.
- Sir, get in the car.

720
00:50:58,794 --> 00:51:00,728
We'll handle it here.

721
00:51:00,996 --> 00:51:02,395
Get in the car.

722
00:51:02,665 --> 00:51:03,723
Move.

723
00:51:03,999 --> 00:51:05,660
Get in the car.

724
00:51:06,602 --> 00:51:08,730
Control our Soldiers.

725
00:51:09,371 --> 00:51:11,430
Saheb, Dutta sir's here,
He will handle everything.

726
00:51:11,507 --> 00:51:13,441
Let me speak with the Police.

727
00:51:14,076 --> 00:51:15,076
Go.

728
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:16,441
Move. Move.

729
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:17,478
Let me get down.

730
00:51:17,546 --> 00:51:19,139
Stop the car. Stop the car.

731
00:51:20,182 --> 00:51:22,412
You leave.

732
00:51:25,454 --> 00:51:28,515
Come on, Modak.
Let's move. I said let's move now.

733
00:52:00,089 --> 00:52:03,457
Move aside. Move.

734
00:53:16,131 --> 00:53:20,090
This which I am carrying on my
shoulders, this is your Democracy.

735
00:53:22,271 --> 00:53:24,103
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

736
00:53:24,173 --> 00:53:25,766
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

737
00:53:26,041 --> 00:53:27,509
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

738
00:53:27,576 --> 00:53:29,305
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

739
00:53:29,378 --> 00:53:31,005
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

740
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,570
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

741
00:53:32,648 --> 00:53:34,377
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

742
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:36,145
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

743
00:53:36,218 --> 00:53:37,686
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

744
00:53:37,753 --> 00:53:39,380
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

745
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:41,514
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

746
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:43,080
Lord is the Ultimate truth.

747
00:53:45,194 --> 00:53:46,593
How much for the fruits'?

748
00:53:46,662 --> 00:53:48,756
Threads for sale.
Threads for sale.

749
00:53:49,298 --> 00:53:50,424
That's too much.

750
00:53:50,666 --> 00:53:52,760
No, it's completely right.

751
00:53:52,801 --> 00:53:55,168
Balasaheb's been jailed.

752
00:53:55,237 --> 00:53:56,136
Shutdown everything.

753
00:53:56,205 --> 00:53:58,105
You bloody... shut it down, I said.

754
00:53:58,173 --> 00:54:01,006
Balasaheb's been jailed.

755
00:54:02,411 --> 00:54:04,539
Balasaheb's been jailed.

756
00:54:31,106 --> 00:54:33,165
Vasant Rao, who is running Mumbai'?

757
00:54:33,509 --> 00:54:34,305
What are they doing?

758
00:54:34,376 --> 00:54:36,105
What the hell is
your Police Force doing?

759
00:54:36,645 --> 00:54:37,645
No, sir.

760
00:54:38,614 --> 00:54:40,174
We've deployed the entire Police Force.

761
00:54:40,616 --> 00:54:41,616
Everything is in control.

762
00:54:57,065 --> 00:55:00,262
But the report received at
the PMO is completely different.

763
00:55:10,479 --> 00:55:13,312
Vasant Rao, do what it takes,
but bring the situation under control.

764
00:55:13,549 --> 00:55:14,549
Please.

765
00:55:18,487 --> 00:55:20,251
I want Bombay peaceful again.

766
00:55:21,123 --> 00:55:22,123
Yes, sir.

767
00:55:30,299 --> 00:55:32,267
Call Modak.

768
00:55:37,673 --> 00:55:41,632
Now who's going to explain to
him that it's not in our hands?

769
00:55:43,245 --> 00:55:46,306
Only one man can calm down Mumbai,
right now.

770
00:55:48,717 --> 00:55:53,746
George, I had great faith in
Mr. Vasant Rao.

771
00:55:54,223 --> 00:55:57,284
But unfortunately, he gave in as well,
to pressure from Delhi.

772
00:55:58,427 --> 00:56:01,294
This country needs a dictator.

773
00:56:03,532 --> 00:56:04,590
One is born already!

774
00:56:05,734 --> 00:56:08,396
A dictator has already
taken shape in you.

775
00:56:13,709 --> 00:56:15,143
And you're saying this, George?

776
00:56:16,311 --> 00:56:18,678
Someone who never believed
in Democracy all his life.

777
00:56:18,747 --> 00:56:23,184
There was a time when you uprooted rail
tracks to protest against the Government...

778
00:56:24,052 --> 00:56:27,545
but not a word against
Them after our arrests.

779
00:56:27,623 --> 00:56:30,558
Why are you saying that?

780
00:56:32,027 --> 00:56:33,256
I did come here to see you?

781
00:56:34,062 --> 00:56:40,764
The government says that Shiv Sena should try
peaceful protests with Support of ideology.

782
00:56:41,036 --> 00:56:42,197
Peaceful protests?

783
00:56:44,072 --> 00:56:46,006
And how on earth do we do that...

784
00:56:47,042 --> 00:56:48,305
from behind these bars?

785
00:56:50,145 --> 00:56:53,479
Those who burnt the Bangalore Mail,
Madras Mail, are National Heroes.

786
00:56:53,649 --> 00:56:54,649
And we're Fascists.

787
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:56,550
Shoot at sight orders, really?

788
00:56:58,553 --> 00:57:00,214
Bloody sons of General Dire.

789
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:03,589
George, some water.

790
00:57:04,092 --> 00:57:06,390
Yes, he's pretty thirsty.

791
00:57:06,728 --> 00:57:08,560
I'll help myself.

792
00:57:10,699 --> 00:57:11,699
Here...

793
00:57:17,673 --> 00:57:22,702
Thanks to your Democracy,
69 of my boys were killed.

794
00:57:23,712 --> 00:57:26,257
Sir, some people are here to see
here from the Chief Minister's office.

795
00:57:26,281 --> 00:57:27,561
- Shall I...
- Yes, send them in.

796
00:57:30,585 --> 00:57:34,044
Bal, you must take care.

797
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:40,391
Now everyone knows that George isn't
the only one who can shut down Mumbai.

798
00:57:41,763 --> 00:57:44,528
When Bal Thackeray sets Mumbai ablaze...

799
00:57:44,733 --> 00:57:47,532
even Delhi feels the heat!

800
00:57:50,706 --> 00:57:52,333
You just be careful.

801
00:57:57,112 --> 00:57:58,112
George.

802
00:58:00,515 --> 00:58:04,975
Sometimes one needs a
spark to diminish the darkness.

803
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:10,368
I've heard there's a
curfew in Lalbaug as well?

804
00:58:10,392 --> 00:58:11,188
I heard that too.

805
00:58:11,259 --> 00:58:13,353
Some of Marmik's editions
had to be delivered.

806
00:58:14,129 --> 00:58:15,609
And I've asked Babban to do the same.

807
00:58:16,064 --> 00:58:17,691
- And...
- Thackeray, letter for you.

808
00:58:19,568 --> 00:58:21,195
I'll be right back.

809
00:58:23,405 --> 00:58:24,445
How are things, Kamble?

810
00:58:24,506 --> 00:58:25,506
I am fine.

811
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,380
Yes...

812
00:58:33,515 --> 00:58:36,177
Sau, Minas. Hail Maharashtra.

813
00:58:38,587 --> 00:58:40,747
'These days I've been receiving
a plethora of letters.'

814
00:58:42,758 --> 00:58:49,630
'All of them make me so emotional,
that they touch our hearts.'

815
00:58:52,234 --> 00:58:53,759
'And we feel overwhelmed.'

816
00:58:56,605 --> 00:58:59,336
'Such dedication, so much love.'

817
00:59:01,943 --> 00:59:03,263
'I received your letter as well.'

818
00:59:05,947 --> 00:59:08,177
'We must all face the situation.'

819
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:12,985
'I have only one regret.'

820
00:59:13,722 --> 00:59:18,250
'There's no one to advocate
Maharashtra in front of Delhi.'

821
00:59:21,329 --> 00:59:24,128
'A person like me who has
never even walked 10 steps...'

822
00:59:25,367 --> 00:59:30,669
'I have no idea or count of how many steps
I Keep pacing in my cell, every day.'

823
00:59:32,474 --> 00:59:36,433
'Thinking... Thinking... and
then thinking again.'

824
00:59:40,082 --> 00:59:41,481
'How is our Aquarium?'

825
00:59:43,452 --> 00:59:44,613
'How is Marshall?'

826
00:59:47,722 --> 00:59:51,625
Good to hear that Timba
and Binda are behaving properly.

827
00:59:54,663 --> 00:59:57,325
Think twice before sending
them to far off meetings.

828
00:59:58,366 --> 01:00:01,165
The Mumbai Police is heartless...

829
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:05,035
and they won't back down from
taking any action, anytime, anywhere...

830
01:00:05,173 --> 01:00:07,369
because their soul is dead.

831
01:00:09,277 --> 01:00:12,178
Tell the children to read
something nice in the afternoon.

832
01:00:14,516 --> 01:00:18,350
Bring them autobiographies
of great and successful.

833
01:00:20,388 --> 01:00:21,514
What about Srimit?

834
01:00:22,324 --> 01:00:25,259
I've heard he's handling
Marmik pretty well.

835
01:00:27,195 --> 01:00:29,562
He's been explained
all the important factors.

836
01:00:32,667 --> 01:00:35,107
The entire family's responsibility
is now on your shoulders...

837
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:42,203
and hearing how well you're
executing them is a treat to hear.

838
01:00:48,049 --> 01:00:51,451
Maa, you must take
care of yourself too.

839
01:00:55,624 --> 01:00:58,059
You didn't have tea yet.

840
01:00:58,326 --> 01:00:59,326
Neelu.

841
01:01:00,562 --> 01:01:01,562
Serve them this tea.

842
01:01:07,269 --> 01:01:08,395
Was that Saheb's letter?

843
01:01:09,237 --> 01:01:10,237
Yes.

844
01:01:13,475 --> 01:01:14,475
He's fine.

845
01:01:17,479 --> 01:01:21,040
People love me, is that my fault too?

846
01:01:21,383 --> 01:01:25,081
But Saheb, people are waging
war for the sake of that love.

847
01:01:26,087 --> 01:01:27,687
Bombay is under curfew,
and it's burning.

848
01:01:28,223 --> 01:01:31,284
Your men have closed clown schools,
colleges, factories.

849
01:01:33,695 --> 01:01:34,787
They are my boys.

850
01:01:35,597 --> 01:01:38,794
But Saheb, all this should stop now.

851
01:01:40,335 --> 01:01:42,804
We must restore Bombay
to what it was earlier.

852
01:01:43,405 --> 01:01:46,170
Saheb, this is a request.

853
01:01:46,374 --> 01:01:49,241
Only you can calm down Shiv Sainiks.

854
01:01:54,583 --> 01:01:56,142
Talk to the Chief Minister.

855
01:01:56,451 --> 01:01:57,509
The Prime Minister.

856
01:01:59,154 --> 01:02:00,634
They are the ones who have the power.

857
01:02:01,389 --> 01:02:04,120
Everyone knows who
controls power in Bombay.

858
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:08,724
Your intervention can fix the
Law and Order situation in Bombay.

859
01:02:09,598 --> 01:02:10,429
And now...

860
01:02:10,498 --> 01:02:12,125
And yes, sir...

861
01:02:12,734 --> 01:02:16,261
The CM has specially
sent you a message...

862
01:02:16,605 --> 01:02:20,439
that other organizations are
taking advantage of your agitation.

863
01:02:48,603 --> 01:02:51,698
""The Government has
called in the Indian Army...""

864
01:02:52,407 --> 01:02:54,501
""to maintain Law
and Order in Mumbai.""

865
01:02:55,176 --> 01:02:57,338
""But I am very sad
and hurt to hear this.""

866
01:02:58,346 --> 01:03:01,213
""Our army is for the
safety of our borders...""

867
01:03:01,283 --> 01:03:03,684
""and not to deal with
our internal conflicts.""

868
01:03:05,086 --> 01:03:07,111
""This is not good for us at all.""

869
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:11,121
""The country is always our
first priority, and then our state.""

870
01:03:20,268 --> 01:03:23,568
""I call upon my Shiv Sainiks.""

871
01:03:24,205 --> 01:03:30,167
""To come together and work towards bringing
peace and harmony back in the city.""

872
01:03:30,779 --> 01:03:32,178
""And they must also make sure...""

873
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:37,042
""that entities like Lal Bhai
or any other organizations...""

874
01:03:37,552 --> 01:03:43,787
""don't take undue advantage
of our agitation and struggle.""

875
01:03:44,793 --> 01:03:46,727
""Bal Thackeray.""

876
01:03:48,496 --> 01:03:49,395
Control room.

877
01:03:49,497 --> 01:03:50,577
Control room. Control room.

878
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:53,131
There's a crowd of people
gathering at Parel Naka.

879
01:03:53,234 --> 01:03:54,531
They are carrying weapons.

880
01:03:54,636 --> 01:03:56,263
Please get there as soon as possible.

881
01:03:56,338 --> 01:03:57,338
Over.

882
01:04:30,338 --> 01:04:34,206
And this way, repeatedly the Police is just
watching helplessly, like an audience.

883
01:04:34,275 --> 01:04:36,505
Has the Government turned meek?

884
01:04:37,212 --> 01:04:40,045
How much lower is this
Government going to stoop...

885
01:04:40,115 --> 01:04:42,345
due to the fear of one man,
Mr. Speaker?

886
01:04:42,617 --> 01:04:45,314
This is not Democracy,
this is Dictatorship!

887
01:04:46,221 --> 01:04:50,180
Mr. Speaker,
this Government is forcing our Police...

888
01:04:50,458 --> 01:04:55,453
to bow before the same
man who sparked these riots.

889
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:57,020
Shame on this Government!

890
01:04:57,098 --> 01:04:59,430
Shame on them!

891
01:04:59,601 --> 01:05:04,596
Mr. Speaker, Law, and Order
in Bombay were in complete disarray...

892
01:05:04,672 --> 01:05:08,973
while this power-hungry
government was snoring away.

893
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:13,372
We doubt the role
that our Chief Minister played.

894
01:05:13,648 --> 01:05:17,414
And I sincerely request you,
in fact, I implore you...

895
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:20,682
to accept our non-confidence
motion immediately.

896
01:05:20,755 --> 01:05:23,281
Krishna Desai, your time is up.

897
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:26,123
Please sit down.

898
01:05:26,227 --> 01:05:28,491
Kalyan Rao is about
to give you a reply.

899
01:05:29,197 --> 01:05:31,723
Sit down. Sit down.

900
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:34,200
Your time is up.

901
01:05:53,788 --> 01:05:55,483
It's been so long
since we last came here.

902
01:05:58,526 --> 01:06:00,392
You hardly get the time.

903
01:06:01,729 --> 01:06:03,424
But I did today.

904
01:06:07,535 --> 01:06:08,535
Are you angry?

905
01:06:11,339 --> 01:06:13,364
I've no reason to be angry.

906
01:06:15,343 --> 01:06:17,107
Children eagerly await your return.

907
01:06:20,448 --> 01:06:21,448
And you?

908
01:06:26,588 --> 01:06:27,612
You know you're too much.

909
01:06:28,156 --> 01:06:29,385
Now, this is our life.

910
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:37,328
What can be better
than helping those in heed?

911
01:06:40,101 --> 01:06:44,538
But the fact that all
eyes are on us at all the time...

912
01:06:47,775 --> 01:06:49,504
is a little bit weird.

913
01:06:51,212 --> 01:06:52,212
Get used to it.

914
01:06:54,415 --> 01:06:55,644
You know what...

915
01:06:57,719 --> 01:06:59,710
earlier when I used to look at people...

916
01:07:01,356 --> 01:07:03,120
I used to see the humor in them.

917
01:07:03,958 --> 01:07:05,798
But now when I look at
the same people again...

918
01:07:06,694 --> 01:07:09,595
I see their pain,
their problems, and their questions.

919
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:17,534
Almost as if the artist
inside me is fading away.

920
01:07:23,545 --> 01:07:31,316
Hmm, along with that artist, even my
husband is getting lost in the crowd.

921
01:07:31,419 --> 01:07:32,250
Mother!

922
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,048
Hey...

923
01:07:33,121 --> 01:07:33,519
Mother!

924
01:07:33,588 --> 01:07:34,384
Where are you going?

925
01:07:34,455 --> 01:07:36,321
Not that way. Now in the water. No!

926
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:38,320
Not that way, dear.

927
01:07:40,461 --> 01:07:41,587
Don't cry, dear.

928
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:43,426
My child.

929
01:07:43,498 --> 01:07:44,608
You're with her, aren't you?

930
01:07:44,632 --> 01:07:46,066
You should be looking after her.

931
01:07:46,134 --> 01:07:46,566
Yes...

932
01:07:46,634 --> 01:07:48,329
- Can she swim?
- No.

933
01:07:48,403 --> 01:07:49,403
Then.

934
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,130
Balloons. Balloons.

935
01:07:54,342 --> 01:07:55,571
Only 10 cents.

936
01:07:55,643 --> 01:07:57,611
- Pintya, start the car.
- Sir...

937
01:07:58,279 --> 01:07:59,279
What?

938
01:08:00,949 --> 01:08:02,144
What do you want, son?

939
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:03,508
Autograph, please.

940
01:08:03,585 --> 01:08:04,585
Whose?

941
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,320
Her?

942
01:08:08,022 --> 01:08:09,148
No, Sir. Yours.

943
01:08:15,496 --> 01:08:17,487
- What is your name?
- Keshav.

944
01:08:19,334 --> 01:08:20,597
Just like my father.

945
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:25,205
- Which school, son?
- Gyaneshwar Vidya Mandir.

946
01:08:25,273 --> 01:08:27,264
- Which class?
- Class Four.

947
01:08:28,376 --> 01:08:30,276
- Do you know my name?
- Yes.

948
01:08:30,645 --> 01:08:32,374
- What is it?
- Tiger!

949
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,545
Tiger?

950
01:08:33,648 --> 01:08:35,207
He looks more like a rat.

951
01:08:35,483 --> 01:08:36,483
Exactly.

952
01:08:36,985 --> 01:08:40,011
Why did Mr. Naidu round
up all of us to kill this rat?

953
01:08:41,255 --> 01:08:43,451
- What's his name?
- Bal Thackeray.

954
01:08:44,058 --> 01:08:46,026
I've heard that he
practically controls Mumbai.

955
01:08:46,094 --> 01:08:47,118
Him?

956
01:08:47,328 --> 01:08:48,523
Are you kidding me?

957
01:08:51,666 --> 01:08:52,666
Naidu sir is here.

958
01:08:52,734 --> 01:08:53,734
Come on.

959
01:08:56,738 --> 01:08:59,673
Sir, some gangsters from
Nagpur are here to kill you.

960
01:08:59,741 --> 01:09:00,741
They are outside.

961
01:09:02,076 --> 01:09:03,134
Hand me my bag.

962
01:09:03,211 --> 01:09:04,211
Sir.

963
01:09:05,947 --> 01:09:08,109
- That's him, in there.
- Come on.

964
01:09:13,554 --> 01:09:14,554
I am Naidu.

965
01:09:15,289 --> 01:09:17,621
- Are you Bal Thackeray?
- Yes?

966
01:09:17,725 --> 01:09:18,725
So.

967
01:09:19,293 --> 01:09:20,293
We need to talk.

968
01:09:21,262 --> 01:09:22,262
We are.

969
01:09:23,698 --> 01:09:26,463
Not here, outside.

970
01:09:30,071 --> 01:09:32,071
What's so special outside?
Your wedding procession?

971
01:09:33,141 --> 01:09:34,540
You bloody...

972
01:09:35,309 --> 01:09:36,640
Hold him.

973
01:09:49,023 --> 01:09:50,023
Saheb, blood.

974
01:09:50,058 --> 01:09:51,058
Blood?

975
01:09:53,528 --> 01:09:55,360
You threw that garbage dump on me.

976
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:56,688
This is just tomato sauce.

977
01:09:57,265 --> 01:09:58,265
Let's clean this up.

978
01:10:03,104 --> 01:10:04,663
You bloody...

979
01:10:06,741 --> 01:10:07,741
I feel ashamed.

980
01:10:08,309 --> 01:10:10,277
I don't want my soldiers
to be afraid like these.

981
01:10:10,344 --> 01:10:11,436
I want fighters.

982
01:10:11,512 --> 01:10:13,002
But this attack?

983
01:10:14,449 --> 01:10:15,780
I don't know.

984
01:10:17,618 --> 01:10:19,746
These people live and breed here.

985
01:10:20,021 --> 01:10:21,716
But praise outsiders
like China and Russia.

986
01:10:23,157 --> 01:10:25,455
We'll have to get rid
of these baboons permanently.

987
01:10:27,161 --> 01:10:28,458
Puma. Come here.

988
01:10:29,063 --> 01:10:29,757
5 minutes.

989
01:10:30,031 --> 01:10:31,031
(Sta)'-

990
01:10:33,434 --> 01:10:34,560
Where's that sack?

991
01:10:53,054 --> 01:10:54,054
Where is he?

992
01:10:54,088 --> 01:10:54,782
In his office.

993
01:10:54,822 --> 01:10:55,550
Are there people around?

994
01:10:55,623 --> 01:10:56,681
No, not much.

995
01:10:59,193 --> 01:11:00,752
Puma, call him outside.

996
01:11:01,329 --> 01:11:02,329
Okay.

997
01:11:11,706 --> 01:11:12,764
- Desai sir?
- Inside.

998
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,008
I've called for a
meeting at Gate no. 4.

999
01:11:15,076 --> 01:11:17,670
I want everyone there at 8,
I'll be coming there.

1000
01:11:17,745 --> 01:11:21,613
Desai sir. We need to talk in private,
it's urgent.

1001
01:11:22,517 --> 01:11:23,917
- Prakash, see what he wants.
- Sir.

1002
01:11:24,018 --> 01:11:25,679
No, sir, I must talk only to you.

1003
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,120
Go take a look.

1004
01:11:27,321 --> 01:11:28,789
I want everyone there by 8.

1005
01:11:29,056 --> 01:11:30,056
Yes...

1006
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:31,458
All of you...

1007
01:11:48,643 --> 01:11:49,643
Desai sir didn't come.

1008
01:11:50,411 --> 01:11:52,743
We want to meet Krishna Desai.
Please call him.

1009
01:11:53,047 --> 01:11:54,124
He said I should talk to you.

1010
01:11:54,148 --> 01:11:56,412
I will tell him whatever it is.

1011
01:12:01,422 --> 01:12:02,422
Close it down.

1012
01:12:05,626 --> 01:12:07,025
What the...

1013
01:12:09,463 --> 01:12:12,228
- Tambe, bring me a torch.
- Right away.

1014
01:12:13,634 --> 01:12:15,602
- What?
- That's him.

1015
01:12:18,306 --> 01:12:21,401
- Who are they, Prakash?
- Some people from Jai Bharat.

1016
01:12:21,475 --> 01:12:23,569
Jai Bharat. Some people
to see you from Jai Bharat.

1017
01:12:23,644 --> 01:12:25,305
- Jai Bharat?
- Yes.

1018
01:12:25,379 --> 01:12:28,076
- What Jai Bharat.
- Don't know.

1019
01:12:28,516 --> 01:12:30,450
- I am from Lalbaug.
- Lalbaug?

1020
01:12:30,785 --> 01:12:31,785
From Jai Bharat.

1021
01:12:38,526 --> 01:12:41,223
Leave him. Let him go.

1022
01:12:41,395 --> 01:12:42,191
Comrade.

1023
01:12:42,263 --> 01:12:43,059
Comrade.

1024
01:12:43,097 --> 01:12:45,031
Come on. Get up.

1025
01:13:43,124 --> 01:13:44,319
Wait, you...

1026
01:13:44,392 --> 01:13:46,451
Where do you think you're going?

1027
01:13:46,661 --> 01:13:48,652
Trying to be over-smart?

1028
01:13:51,032 --> 01:13:52,397
Come on.

1029
01:13:52,466 --> 01:13:54,400
We'll show you. Come on.

1030
01:14:00,508 --> 01:14:02,602
- I'll show you.
- Come on.

1031
01:14:03,177 --> 01:14:06,203
- On whose orders did you kill him?
- I don't know.

1032
01:14:06,247 --> 01:14:09,308
- On whose orders did you kill him?
- I don't know.

1033
01:14:09,383 --> 01:14:13,616
- Who sent you?
- I don't know!

1034
01:14:54,636 --> 01:14:57,731
After the final countdown
of votes for Parel Constituency...

1035
01:14:57,806 --> 01:15:00,673
Sarojini Krishna
Desai is at 27, 788 votes

1036
01:15:00,775 --> 01:15:03,176
and Vaman Mahadik is at 29, 287 votes.

1037
01:15:03,211 --> 01:15:04,736
Hello.

1038
01:15:05,146 --> 01:15:06,580
Digu speaking.

1039
01:15:06,982 --> 01:15:09,849
Hello, Mr. Journalist. What's up?

1040
01:15:10,251 --> 01:15:11,811
It's been a while
since you last called.

1041
01:15:11,853 --> 01:15:16,791
Well, you know that my journalism
is incomplete without you.

1042
01:15:18,226 --> 01:15:20,923
- Is sir in?
- Let me check.

1043
01:15:23,865 --> 01:15:24,559
Hello, sir.

1044
01:15:24,632 --> 01:15:27,158
Sarojini Krishna Desai
is at 29, 913 votes

1045
01:15:27,235 --> 01:15:29,636
and Vaman Mahadi is at 31, 592 votes.

1046
01:15:29,704 --> 01:15:31,194
Congratulation, sir.

1047
01:15:31,272 --> 01:15:34,037
Since your candidate has won.

1048
01:15:34,275 --> 01:15:35,868
My candidate?

1049
01:15:37,078 --> 01:15:39,604
Well, I'll have to call
him your candidate now.

1050
01:15:39,748 --> 01:15:41,739
The Vasant Sena after all.

1051
01:15:44,085 --> 01:15:46,520
You're playing fine politics.

1052
01:15:46,821 --> 01:15:50,018
Instead of expanding
your own Congress Party...

1053
01:15:50,091 --> 01:15:52,219
you're encouraging others instead.

1054
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:57,120
I hope this doesn't come around
to bite you in the future.

1055
01:15:57,766 --> 01:15:59,996
We'll deal with it as it comes.

1056
01:16:00,068 --> 01:16:02,560
Shiv sena candidate.

1057
01:16:02,637 --> 01:16:05,663
Vaman Mahadik wins by 1679 votes.

1058
01:16:06,074 --> 01:16:08,668
Saheb, the first candidate has won.

1059
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:10,509
Congratulations.

1060
01:16:10,678 --> 01:16:12,772
- Can I come in?
- Come in, Dada Kondke. Come in.

1061
01:16:13,681 --> 01:16:14,681
So Dada.

1062
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:17,576
I heard that ""Songadiya""
is breaking all records.

1063
01:16:19,687 --> 01:16:21,587
Speak freely, they are all like family.

1064
01:16:22,991 --> 01:16:26,689
Saheb, Songadiya was doing
tremendous business at Kohinoor.

1065
01:16:26,961 --> 01:16:27,587
What do you mean?

1066
01:16:27,662 --> 01:16:30,927
I requested the theatre authorities to
let it run for a couple of more weeks.

1067
01:16:30,999 --> 01:16:33,627
- And?
- They downright refused me.

1068
01:16:33,701 --> 01:16:35,863
They don't want to
show Marathi films anymore.

1069
01:16:35,937 --> 01:16:36,937
Why?

1070
01:16:37,138 --> 01:16:40,130
They want to run a Hindi film.

1071
01:16:40,642 --> 01:16:43,043
I went to Ministers, and everyone else.

1072
01:16:43,111 --> 01:16:44,840
But I didn't get help from anyone.

1073
01:16:45,046 --> 01:16:49,779
When Hindi film heroines strip their
clothes, everyone jumps up on their seats.

1074
01:16:49,851 --> 01:16:53,549
But they stripped down a Marathi film,
and no one came forward.

1075
01:16:53,621 --> 01:16:55,988
They stripped down my Marathi film.

1076
01:16:56,057 --> 01:16:57,923
If Marathi films don't
play in Maharashtra,

1077
01:16:57,992 --> 01:16:59,870
then will they play
South Indian films instead?

1078
01:16:59,894 --> 01:17:01,658
Now you please do something.

1079
01:17:01,729 --> 01:17:02,992
We are with you.

1080
01:17:03,064 --> 01:17:04,862
Waman Mahadik, go ahead.

1081
01:17:04,933 --> 01:17:07,197
We are with you.

1082
01:17:07,469 --> 01:17:10,700
Waman Mahadik, go ahead.
We are with you.

1083
01:17:10,772 --> 01:17:11,671
Welcome, Mr. MLA.

1084
01:17:11,739 --> 01:17:15,107
Waman Mahadik, go ahead.
We are with you.

1085
01:17:16,911 --> 01:17:18,470
I need your blessings, sir.

1086
01:17:24,052 --> 01:17:26,521
Saheb, I owe all this to you.

1087
01:17:26,621 --> 01:17:27,621
Congratulations.

1088
01:17:28,123 --> 01:17:29,648
Now, enough with the felicitations.

1089
01:17:30,191 --> 01:17:31,784
And let's go to Kohinoor theatre.

1090
01:17:32,193 --> 01:17:34,491
Kohinoor? Which show?

1091
01:17:34,929 --> 01:17:36,289
Today we're the star of this show.

1092
01:17:40,001 --> 01:17:42,663
The Film Industry was started
in this country by a Maharashtrian.

1093
01:17:43,171 --> 01:17:45,811
And today our Maharashtrian films
don't get a slot in the theatres.

1094
01:17:47,842 --> 01:17:52,006
- Long live...
- Shiv Sena!

1095
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,845
- Long live...
- Shiv Sena!

1096
01:17:57,185 --> 01:17:59,745
My home, my bed, and your dreams, huh?

1097
01:18:00,855 --> 01:18:02,220
This can't go on here now.

1098
01:18:04,759 --> 01:18:06,727
The Marathi people
have the first right here.

1099
01:18:10,932 --> 01:18:12,058
Then come, your dreams.

1100
01:18:14,602 --> 01:18:15,602
First come, my dreams.

1101
01:18:15,803 --> 01:18:20,604
- Marathi workers deserve jobs first...
- They do... They do...

1102
01:18:20,675 --> 01:18:25,772
- Marathi workers deserve jobs first...
- They do... They do...

1103
01:18:25,847 --> 01:18:30,114
- First right to the sons of this soil.
- Then the Outsiders!

1104
01:18:30,185 --> 01:18:34,247
- First right to the sons of this soil.
- Then the Outsiders!

1105
01:18:34,522 --> 01:18:39,483
- The sons of these soils must get a job first.
- They do...

1106
01:18:39,561 --> 01:18:43,759
- The sons of these soils must get a job first.
- They do...

1107
01:18:48,102 --> 01:18:48,898
Babban.

1108
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:50,450
- Long live...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray.

1109
01:18:50,538 --> 01:18:56,102
- Marathi workers deserve jobs first...
- They do... They do...

1110
01:19:01,015 --> 01:19:05,213
- Long live...
- Shiv Sena!

1111
01:19:26,507 --> 01:19:29,568
- Long live...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray.

1112
01:19:29,644 --> 01:19:33,137
- Long live...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray.

1113
01:19:33,214 --> 01:19:38,618
Mr. Nanda, the Marathi youngsters
have a right to these jobs first.

1114
01:19:39,587 --> 01:19:43,114
Yes, Mr. Thackeray.
But that is not our Central Policy.

1115
01:19:43,258 --> 01:19:47,252
Then... change your policy, Mr. Nanda.

1116
01:19:47,729 --> 01:19:49,197
But I must follow the rules.

1117
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:57,738
Mr. Nanda, maybe the skies where your
airplanes soar, belong to you...

1118
01:19:57,939 --> 01:20:01,967
but the streets you use
to get to your home, belong to me.

1119
01:20:05,813 --> 01:20:07,838
Are you threatening me?

1120
01:20:09,951 --> 01:20:11,510
This is not possible.

1121
01:20:20,128 --> 01:20:21,505
- How are you, Babban?
- Hail Maharashtra.

1122
01:20:21,529 --> 01:20:22,529
So you got bail.

1123
01:20:22,597 --> 01:20:24,691
- Happy Diwali.
- Same to you.

1124
01:20:30,138 --> 01:20:34,132
You made one phone call
and I got bail immediately.

1125
01:20:35,109 --> 01:20:36,873
Happy Diwali, Maa.

1126
01:20:37,011 --> 01:20:38,088
Don't leave without
eating something first.

1127
01:20:38,112 --> 01:20:38,704
Yes.

1128
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:40,544
- Is your mother keeping well?
- Yes, she is.

1129
01:20:41,182 --> 01:20:42,946
- Don't pick them up.
- What are you doing?

1130
01:20:43,251 --> 01:20:44,251
Take these.

1131
01:20:48,122 --> 01:20:50,216
Why did you have to
keep it in your pocket?

1132
01:20:56,030 --> 01:20:57,088
Babban, how are you'?

1133
01:20:57,165 --> 01:20:58,860
- Happy Diwali.
- Yes, Happy Diwali.

1134
01:21:00,902 --> 01:21:01,664
Come on.

1135
01:21:01,736 --> 01:21:03,761
Father, even I want firecrackers.

1136
01:21:03,838 --> 01:21:04,862
Yes, we will.

1137
01:21:05,039 --> 01:21:06,039
No, I want them no.

1138
01:21:06,107 --> 01:21:08,667
- Let's first get out of here.
- No, I want them now.

1139
01:21:08,743 --> 01:21:11,075
Now, father.

1140
01:21:19,153 --> 01:21:20,780
You and your Sena.

1141
01:21:21,889 --> 01:21:23,857
When you were rotting behind bars...

1142
01:21:24,892 --> 01:21:26,917
did anyone come
forward to bail you out?

1143
01:21:27,962 --> 01:21:29,521
Not a morsel to eat at home...

1144
01:21:29,797 --> 01:21:32,232
and he's always out
listening to Saheb's speeches.

1145
01:21:33,167 --> 01:21:35,932
Always yelling Hail Maharashtra.

1146
01:21:36,571 --> 01:21:38,039
Hail Maharashtra, grandma.

1147
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:39,239
Shut up!

1148
01:21:39,841 --> 01:21:41,536
Like father like son.

1149
01:21:41,976 --> 01:21:45,002
If I ever hear ""Hail Maharashtra""
in this house again...

1150
01:21:45,079 --> 01:21:46,979
then you've had it.

1151
01:21:47,582 --> 01:21:50,051
- Hail Maharashtra.
- Who is that?

1152
01:21:51,753 --> 01:21:53,221
Hello, aunty.

1153
01:21:53,488 --> 01:21:54,956
Mr. Navalkar, please come in.

1154
01:21:55,022 --> 01:21:55,750
Pardon me.

1155
01:21:55,823 --> 01:21:57,018
Please sit.

1156
01:21:57,091 --> 01:21:58,024
Is Babban at home?

1157
01:21:58,092 --> 01:22:00,618
Of course.
He doesn't exactly go to work.

1158
01:22:00,828 --> 01:22:01,852
He's in the house.

1159
01:22:03,164 --> 01:22:05,792
- Navalkar sir...
- No need for this.

1160
01:22:05,933 --> 01:22:07,025
I'll make some tea.

1161
01:22:07,101 --> 01:22:07,897
Let it be.

1162
01:22:07,969 --> 01:22:08,765
And take this.

1163
01:22:08,836 --> 01:22:09,836
What is this for?

1164
01:22:09,871 --> 01:22:11,498
This is from Balasaheb.

1165
01:22:12,807 --> 01:22:14,434
- But sir...
- Keep it.

1166
01:22:15,109 --> 01:22:16,599
Money... But...

1167
01:22:16,677 --> 01:22:17,677
It's okay.

1168
01:22:17,712 --> 01:22:18,770
I'll get you some water.

1169
01:22:20,915 --> 01:22:21,915
So aunty...

1170
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:26,509
Sir, why are you giving him your money?

1171
01:22:26,587 --> 01:22:28,885
Balasaheb gave him those. Not me.

1172
01:22:28,956 --> 01:22:31,448
Can you do one thing for me?

1173
01:22:31,826 --> 01:22:34,227
Tell him to stay away from Balasaheb.

1174
01:22:35,930 --> 01:22:38,160
In fact, you should do the same.

1175
01:22:38,733 --> 01:22:40,531
Find a nice line of work.

1176
01:22:40,601 --> 01:22:42,831
These frequent trips
to jail is not a good thing.

1177
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:47,802
Aunty, did Babban get
arrested for stealing?

1178
01:22:47,875 --> 01:22:48,569
No.

1179
01:22:48,709 --> 01:22:51,735
Our agitation was to ensure
that our boys get work first.

1180
01:22:52,013 --> 01:22:54,482
Your grandson will become
a successful man some day.

1181
01:22:54,549 --> 01:22:55,549
Just wait and watch.

1182
01:22:55,583 --> 01:22:57,108
Will that really happen?

1183
01:22:57,485 --> 01:22:58,485
Of course, it will.

1184
01:22:58,619 --> 01:23:00,747
Just have faith in Balasaheb.

1185
01:23:01,022 --> 01:23:03,491
- Water.
- Let it be.

1186
01:23:03,758 --> 01:23:05,157
I'll take your leave now.

1187
01:23:11,165 --> 01:23:12,476
Come meet me at the
Branch office tomorrow.

1188
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:12,898
Yes.

1189
01:23:12,967 --> 01:23:14,128
Go see him out.

1190
01:23:14,435 --> 01:23:15,435
Yes.

1191
01:23:24,445 --> 01:23:25,879
I don't want to be anyone's God.

1192
01:23:26,214 --> 01:23:27,704
I just want to work for my people.

1193
01:23:29,217 --> 01:23:31,515
Our country got
Independence 25 years ago.

1194
01:23:32,687 --> 01:23:33,813
But the battle is still on.

1195
01:23:34,555 --> 01:23:35,750
And the reason is just one.

1196
01:23:38,893 --> 01:23:41,157
Our youngsters don't have any work.

1197
01:23:43,598 --> 01:23:44,156
We must do something.

1198
01:23:44,232 --> 01:23:46,272
If the Government doesn't do anything,
then we will.

1199
01:23:50,071 --> 01:23:52,768
Open shops on the streets.

1200
01:23:54,075 --> 01:23:58,012
Or just start a 'Vada-Pav'
(Fritter) joints.

1201
01:23:59,447 --> 01:24:01,643
This Vada-Pav will ensure
income for the youngsters...

1202
01:24:01,716 --> 01:24:04,185
as well as provide a
meal for the poor population.

1203
01:24:04,652 --> 01:24:06,484
It will become Mumbai's identity.

1204
01:24:16,697 --> 01:24:18,165
Politics is a dirty business.

1205
01:24:19,133 --> 01:24:23,434
Our organization will
only dwell 20% in Politics...

1206
01:24:24,071 --> 01:24:29,475
and the rest 80% we will deicate only
To social cause.

1207
01:24:30,111 --> 01:24:32,478
There are huge hospitals for the rich.

1208
01:24:32,547 --> 01:24:36,040
But the poor dies on
his way to the hospital.

1209
01:24:36,984 --> 01:24:38,782
Start free ambulance service.

1210
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:43,586
We'll set an example for all
the Political par-ties in the country.

1211
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:48,793
Don't just yell and scream
that there are no jobs.

1212
01:24:52,833 --> 01:24:56,929
If we want to take those jobs, then
we'll need talented candidates for it.

1213
01:24:58,005 --> 01:24:59,029
Hone their skills.

1214
01:24:59,807 --> 01:25:02,902
Only then will our struggle
bear fruit in the future.

1215
01:25:08,516 --> 01:25:11,213
Prepare our boys for
the competitive exams.

1216
01:25:11,752 --> 01:25:15,689
And give them technical education.

1217
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:22,488
The owners will survive when
the companies function smoothly.

1218
01:25:22,863 --> 01:25:25,161
And when the owners survive,
so will the workers.

1219
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,962
If workers survive,
the country will thrive.

1220
01:25:30,738 --> 01:25:33,639
A strike will just be a clog in
the wheel and do more harm to workers.

1221
01:25:42,984 --> 01:25:45,715
Start a union in all
the big companies here.

1222
01:25:55,963 --> 01:25:58,796
The other parties have forced
our youngsters to the street.

1223
01:25:59,233 --> 01:26:00,962
Ruined their lives.

1224
01:26:01,802 --> 01:26:06,603
But our party will lend them a hand in
support and give them a new lease on life.

1225
01:26:07,842 --> 01:26:10,539
If our boys don't get jobs,
at the right time...

1226
01:26:15,249 --> 01:26:18,219
then soon it is sure that 'anarchy'
Will spread throughout our country.

1227
01:26:18,486 --> 01:26:23,720
Ladies and Gentlemen, For the security
of our country...

1228
01:26:24,091 --> 01:26:28,688
the President has declared
an Emergency in the country.

1229
01:26:29,797 --> 01:26:34,826
There is no need to panic.

1230
01:26:36,771 --> 01:26:38,603
In Exercise of the powers,

1231
01:26:38,673 --> 01:26:40,835
confirmed by Clause 1 of Article.

1232
01:26:40,908 --> 01:26:41,932
Hello, Gurwinder.

1233
01:26:42,009 --> 01:26:44,842
Tell your men to burn all our posters.

1234
01:26:44,912 --> 01:26:47,574
352 of the Constitution...

1235
01:26:47,648 --> 01:26:51,141
Inform all the party workers
to reach Nagpur.

1236
01:26:51,218 --> 01:26:52,151
Hail Almighty.

1237
01:26:52,219 --> 01:26:55,052
I, Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, the
President of India.

1238
01:26:55,122 --> 01:26:57,557
By the procl amation declared.

1239
01:27:01,595 --> 01:27:04,189
That a great emergency exists whereby.

1240
01:27:04,465 --> 01:27:07,594
Security of India is threatened
by internal disturbance.

1241
01:27:07,668 --> 01:27:09,693
Listen, Malda office is raided.

1242
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:10,896
Police have raided.

1243
01:27:10,971 --> 01:27:13,838
Hide all the important
documents you have.

1244
01:27:15,576 --> 01:27:16,634
What is this, Balasaheb?

1245
01:27:16,711 --> 01:27:18,151
You're getting your teeth cleaned...

1246
01:27:18,212 --> 01:27:22,547
whereas that Rajni is preparing
to wipe out your Organisation.

1247
01:27:23,217 --> 01:27:25,481
One can't clean with dirty hands.

1248
01:27:25,553 --> 01:27:27,612
What kind of an Emergency' is this?

1249
01:27:28,255 --> 01:27:32,522
Mr. Desai, this is clearly
a conspiracy to suppress our voice.

1250
01:27:32,593 --> 01:27:33,593
<i>Mr. Outta...</i>

1251
01:27:34,562 --> 01:27:36,963
Only Dr. Shroff can shut my mouth.

1252
01:27:38,966 --> 01:27:41,162
I am the man who sticks
his hand in the tiger's mouth.

1253
01:27:41,235 --> 01:27:43,169
But even I can't suppress his voice.

1254
01:27:43,237 --> 01:27:44,864
Otherwise, my clinic will close down.

1255
01:27:51,512 --> 01:27:54,140
Balasaheb, don't take it lightly.

1256
01:27:55,116 --> 01:27:57,050
This is their final warning.

1257
01:27:57,785 --> 01:28:00,220
Shiv Sena must merge with Congress.

1258
01:28:01,188 --> 01:28:03,919
And the formalities
have already been completed.

1259
01:28:04,859 --> 01:28:08,124
Someone from Rajni's office will
come to you with all the documents.

1260
01:28:10,064 --> 01:28:15,161
If you don't sign,
then they will ban Shiv Sena.

1261
01:28:18,038 --> 01:28:24,944
All the related documents have
already reached Indiraji at South Block.

1262
01:28:39,827 --> 01:28:42,922
Tell Rajni I won't
sign on the merger papers.

1263
01:28:46,133 --> 01:28:53,733
The day they put a ban on my
organization, that day will be his last.

1264
01:28:59,013 --> 01:29:02,711
Hello. This is All
India Radio, Mumbai.

1265
01:29:02,983 --> 01:29:05,577
And now for News in Hindi.

1266
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:12,590
Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi will
arrive at Bombay Airport at 10:20 am.

1267
01:29:13,027 --> 01:29:16,725
At 11:00 am in Tilak Bhavan Garden...

1268
01:29:16,797 --> 01:29:18,317
Sister-in-law,
why did you turn it off?

1269
01:29:18,599 --> 01:29:19,599
What's wrong?

1270
01:29:21,735 --> 01:29:23,965
Does Indiraji read Marmik as well?

1271
01:29:25,039 --> 01:29:26,039
Why?

1272
01:29:27,141 --> 01:29:32,204
I mean... he's made a lot
of caricatures about her.

1273
01:29:35,115 --> 01:29:37,948
By the way, why do you
think Indiraji wants to meet him?

1274
01:29:38,986 --> 01:29:42,012
Maybe she's never seen a real
tiger before and wants to see one.

1275
01:29:42,556 --> 01:29:45,548
Oh, God. You're his brother after all.

1276
01:29:51,732 --> 01:29:54,827
Will our organization close down?

1277
01:30:18,926 --> 01:30:19,926
Hello.

1278
01:30:19,994 --> 01:30:21,860
It wasn't easy to
recognize Bal Thackeray.

1279
01:30:21,929 --> 01:30:23,021
Hello, sir.

1280
01:30:23,097 --> 01:30:24,792
Hello, sir. Hail Maharashtra, Mr Desai.

1281
01:30:25,099 --> 01:30:26,692
- CM sir.
- Hello, Bala Saheb.

1282
01:30:26,767 --> 01:30:27,165
How are you'?

1283
01:30:27,234 --> 01:30:28,463
- Good.
- All good?

1284
01:30:28,535 --> 01:30:29,535
Yes.

1285
01:30:30,838 --> 01:30:31,838
Just a minute.

1286
01:30:32,806 --> 01:30:33,806
Hello, Bala Saheb.

1287
01:30:46,754 --> 01:30:48,688
I had a word with Vasant Rao.

1288
01:30:49,123 --> 01:30:51,114
And Vasant Rao, with madam.

1289
01:30:51,892 --> 01:30:53,587
You arrived at the right time.

1290
01:30:53,994 --> 01:30:55,894
Otherwise,
the Committee meeting would've begun.

1291
01:30:56,730 --> 01:31:00,132
Madam has reserved complete 5
minutes for you.

1292
01:31:02,102 --> 01:31:03,866
Bala Saheb, Rajni Patel.

1293
01:31:06,707 --> 01:31:07,799
Hello, Mr. Desai.

1294
01:31:11,645 --> 01:31:14,979
Be seated.
It will take a couple of more hours.

1295
01:31:15,049 --> 01:31:17,177
Mr. Thackeray,
madam has called you inside.

1296
01:31:22,656 --> 01:31:24,021
Don't be angry.

1297
01:31:24,491 --> 01:31:29,986
I've heard that you preach that
Maharashtra is only for Maharashtrians.

1298
01:31:30,898 --> 01:31:33,629
I believe in the unity
and diversity of this country.

1299
01:31:34,101 --> 01:31:37,503
Then why do people fear you?

1300
01:31:37,571 --> 01:31:39,903
It's just propaganda by the media.

1301
01:31:40,674 --> 01:31:43,837
I, only talk about the
right and honor of my people.

1302
01:31:43,911 --> 01:31:46,937
Right? What right
are you talking about?

1303
01:31:47,781 --> 01:31:50,079
I didn't create different
states and language.

1304
01:31:50,884 --> 01:31:52,045
The Constitution did.

1305
01:31:53,821 --> 01:31:55,880
And if that is the
foundation of this state...

1306
01:31:56,790 --> 01:31:59,418
then our people have
the right to live respectfully.

1307
01:31:59,493 --> 01:32:01,154
But... that never happened.

1308
01:32:02,896 --> 01:32:03,761
Then I...

1309
01:32:03,831 --> 01:32:04,831
Madam.

1310
01:32:04,999 --> 01:32:09,436
Don't send anyone in
until this meeting isn't over.

1311
01:32:09,770 --> 01:32:10,770
Yes, madam.

1312
01:32:11,071 --> 01:32:12,505
So you were saying...

1313
01:32:12,573 --> 01:32:15,508
I never made any speeches
against the nation.

1314
01:32:16,143 --> 01:32:20,046
If you find any of my speech,
writing, or cartoons...

1315
01:32:20,114 --> 01:32:22,514
me promoting that Maharashtra
is only for Maharashtrian...

1316
01:32:22,549 --> 01:32:24,589
then I will personally
close down my Organisation.

1317
01:32:24,918 --> 01:32:27,238
Those who have been living
for many years in Maharashtra...

1318
01:32:27,688 --> 01:32:29,019
are Maharashtrians for me.

1319
01:32:29,490 --> 01:32:31,219
Like those living
in Punjab are Punjabis.

1320
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:33,524
And Bengalis in Bengal.

1321
01:32:33,961 --> 01:32:35,929
If that is his place of birth,

1322
01:32:36,163 --> 01:32:40,066
then he should get first preference
to a job or education in his state.

1323
01:32:40,134 --> 01:32:41,134
That's all.

1324
01:32:41,835 --> 01:32:44,668
Whenever I say Jai Hind,
Jai Maharashtra.

1325
01:32:45,806 --> 01:32:47,501
I always say Jai Hind first.

1326
01:32:47,941 --> 01:32:48,941
And then Jai Maharashtra.

1327
01:32:49,109 --> 01:32:52,511
Because my country is my
first priority, and then my state.

1328
01:32:52,579 --> 01:32:53,842
- Wait here.
- Okay.

1329
01:32:54,248 --> 01:32:55,647
Just a little later.

1330
01:33:07,428 --> 01:33:11,023
What do you think about the Emergency?

1331
01:33:12,433 --> 01:33:17,030
If Emergency brings discipline in the
country, then I am not against it at all.

1332
01:33:19,873 --> 01:33:24,470
My people were completely
misinformed about you.

1333
01:33:25,145 --> 01:33:27,113
That's why we also had
some misunderstandings too.

1334
01:33:28,115 --> 01:33:34,714
Well, anyway... do think
about my proposal.

1335
01:33:36,023 --> 01:33:38,492
My state, my people. They need me.

1336
01:33:39,827 --> 01:33:41,158
But still, I thank you.

1337
01:33:45,566 --> 01:33:46,124
Jai Hind.

1338
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:48,161
Jai Hind. Jai Maharashtra.

1339
01:33:53,707 --> 01:33:54,707
Yes, madam.

1340
01:33:55,075 --> 01:33:56,804
Bring that file from Mr. Rajni.

1341
01:33:56,877 --> 01:33:57,877
Yes, here you go.

1342
01:34:08,956 --> 01:34:14,793
Out of all the organizations we've banned,
I am removing Shiv Sena from the list.

1343
01:34:15,028 --> 01:34:16,894
Prepare a new list.

1344
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:36,848
- Long Live...
- Shiv Sena!

1345
01:34:36,917 --> 01:34:40,547
- Long Live...
- Shiv Sena!

1346
01:34:51,198 --> 01:34:55,226
Everyone will get it.
Everyone will get one.

1347
01:34:55,502 --> 01:34:57,561
Here you go.

1348
01:34:59,006 --> 01:35:02,670
- Long Live...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray.

1349
01:35:02,743 --> 01:35:06,509
- Long Live...
- Bala Saheb Thackeray.

1350
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:12,610
Today is rightfully a
new beginning for our people.

1351
01:35:13,921 --> 01:35:20,657
People from every caste and creed will
always be welcome in this structure.

1352
01:35:24,865 --> 01:35:28,733
I'll be always here for your help.

1353
01:35:30,571 --> 01:35:37,637
Which reminds of a few lines
by our National Poet Ramdhari Singh.

1354
01:35:40,881 --> 01:35:45,011
""Raging storms and
cyclones as well...""

1355
01:35:45,552 --> 01:35:49,511
""when the people are
enraged and raise an eyebrow.""

1356
01:35:50,224 --> 01:35:53,250
""The paths led by
the chariot of time...""

1357
01:35:53,794 --> 01:35:55,489
""hear the sound.""

1358
01:35:55,562 --> 01:35:58,725
""Vacate the throne,
because the people are coming.""

1359
01:35:58,799 --> 01:36:01,928
""Vacate the throne,
because the people are coming.""

1360
01:36:02,002 --> 01:36:03,766
This is a revolution, my friends.

1361
01:36:03,837 --> 01:36:05,703
A complete revolution.

1362
01:36:23,724 --> 01:36:27,922
Balasaheb, Janta Party won with majority
votes only because of the Emergency.

1363
01:36:27,995 --> 01:36:28,894
But the Congress...

1364
01:36:28,962 --> 01:36:30,896
Congress Party will
never cease to exist.

1365
01:36:32,132 --> 01:36:34,260
It's easy to stay in the
opposition and give speeches.

1366
01:36:35,102 --> 01:36:36,570
But coming in power...

1367
01:36:37,004 --> 01:36:38,204
Enough, sister-in-law. Enough.

1368
01:36:38,272 --> 01:36:39,916
- This is Mumbai's mutton...
- Have some more.

1369
01:36:39,940 --> 01:36:40,964
And not from Baramati.

1370
01:36:43,744 --> 01:36:44,744
Some more...

1371
01:36:45,145 --> 01:36:49,082
But coming to power and running the government
And the country is a different ball game.

1372
01:36:49,950 --> 01:36:51,194
- Get some water.
- Witing 5 years the people...

1373
01:36:51,218 --> 01:36:53,710
will start saying
that Congress was better.

1374
01:36:56,657 --> 01:36:58,819
Balasaheb,
we should do something together.

1375
01:37:00,494 --> 01:37:03,225
Shared, we failed in
everything we did together.

1376
01:37:04,765 --> 01:37:06,460
We started a weekly magazine,
which failed.

1377
01:37:06,533 --> 01:37:08,173
I never got to publish
the second edition.

1378
01:37:08,635 --> 01:37:11,866
I think we're better off as friends,
and not partnership.

1379
01:37:11,938 --> 01:37:13,804
That's how you befriended Vasant Rao.

1380
01:37:13,874 --> 01:37:14,874
No, no, not at all.

1381
01:37:16,243 --> 01:37:22,512
We don't pull each other's legs,
and only share a cigar.

1382
01:37:22,582 --> 01:37:24,107
That's why we are friends.

1383
01:37:25,118 --> 01:37:26,745
You must take rice.

1384
01:37:27,688 --> 01:37:29,679
Enough, sister-in-law. I am full.

1385
01:37:30,057 --> 01:37:31,616
Serve some more to the Minister.

1386
01:37:32,059 --> 01:37:34,050
Need to cook a political mix daily now!

1387
01:37:39,032 --> 01:37:42,263
I've always dreamed
of some Maharashtrian leader...

1388
01:37:43,870 --> 01:37:45,830
of someday becoming
the leader of this country.

1389
01:37:48,108 --> 01:37:55,037
But the problem with our people is that
they don't think beyond Maharashtra.

1390
01:37:55,549 --> 01:37:57,677
Balasaheb, Maharashtrian leaders...

1391
01:37:57,751 --> 01:37:58,479
Come, sit.

1392
01:37:58,652 --> 01:37:59,141
No.

1393
01:37:59,219 --> 01:38:00,778
Come Maa, sit down.

1394
01:38:01,621 --> 01:38:04,147
There's another interesting
fact about Maharashtrian leaders.

1395
01:38:05,025 --> 01:38:07,084
They sit on each other's
seats to go to Delhi.

1396
01:38:07,761 --> 01:38:08,761
Why?

1397
01:38:08,929 --> 01:38:10,897
To acquire each other's seat.

1398
01:38:14,167 --> 01:38:17,535
Mr. Sharad, you think
about politics 24/7.

1399
01:38:18,872 --> 01:38:21,603
- Do you watch dramas or films?
- Sometimes.

1400
01:38:23,243 --> 01:38:25,003
Did you watch the cricket
match two days ago?

1401
01:38:25,545 --> 01:38:27,673
I am not too keen about
watching cricket, Bala Saheb.

1402
01:38:27,748 --> 01:38:29,807
But he is very interested in cricket.

1403
01:38:30,183 --> 01:38:32,618
If there's a match in progress,
and he has the time...

1404
01:38:32,753 --> 01:38:35,245
then he will sit with
the transistor's For the entire day.

1405
01:38:36,223 --> 01:38:37,713
He must be interested as well.

1406
01:38:39,226 --> 01:38:41,266
When Sharad says he's
not interested in something...

1407
01:38:42,229 --> 01:38:43,890
that means he's very interested.

1408
01:38:43,964 --> 01:38:46,797
Like he's interested in me.

1409
01:38:49,169 --> 01:38:50,169
It's 5 o'clock.

1410
01:38:50,604 --> 01:38:51,604
Let's hear the radio.

1411
01:38:52,072 --> 01:38:54,200
Let's hear what Morarji
has to say in today's meeting.

1412
01:38:54,941 --> 01:38:58,969
For the first time the
population of this country...

1413
01:38:59,446 --> 01:39:07,446
have quit being slaves of the
Congress and built their own government.

1414
01:39:09,456 --> 01:39:13,552
- Long Live...
- Morarji sir...

1415
01:39:13,693 --> 01:39:18,927
When the entire country
was against Emergency...

1416
01:39:18,999 --> 01:39:26,463
a few of the local parties
were supported the Emergency.

1417
01:39:27,474 --> 01:39:35,474
The time has come when we drag these
parties out of this country forever.

1418
01:39:35,749 --> 01:39:37,239
Isn't this the Shiv Sena Bhavan?

1419
01:39:37,517 --> 01:39:40,009
Yes, they are the ones
who supported Emergency.

1420
01:39:40,086 --> 01:39:41,247
Bloody traitors.

1421
01:39:41,521 --> 01:39:42,665
Who are you calling traitors?

1422
01:39:42,689 --> 01:39:44,680
You are traitors.

1423
01:39:44,758 --> 01:39:45,919
Come down...

1424
01:39:46,193 --> 01:39:48,525
Wait. Stop.

1425
01:39:49,196 --> 01:39:50,721
Stop.

1426
01:39:52,265 --> 01:39:54,063
Stop.

1427
01:40:30,136 --> 01:40:33,231
""I am not scared of
such baseless attacks.""

1428
01:40:34,741 --> 01:40:36,675
""My father gave me a mantra.""

1429
01:40:37,143 --> 01:40:39,043
(""Get up C) Maratha, wake up now.""

1430
01:40:41,147 --> 01:40:43,514
""Normally a Maratha
doesn't get up easily.""

1431
01:40:43,850 --> 01:40:46,979
""But once he does,
he never steps back.""

1432
01:40:49,523 --> 01:40:52,754
""Even if we lose a few bonds,
the house won't come crashing down.""

1433
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:57,026
""My intentions,
my thoughts, won't end so easily.""

1434
01:41:02,869 --> 01:41:06,100
""The war is far from over,
this is just the beginning.""

1435
01:41:06,773 --> 01:41:11,210
""And, it won't end until every Maharashtrian
gets the respect he deserves.""

1436
01:41:14,881 --> 01:41:17,851
""I am not scared of the encroaching
darkness of today's setting sun.""

1437
01:41:18,919 --> 01:41:22,822
""Tomorrow the dawn will
paint the horizon red again.""

1438
01:41:26,493 --> 01:41:28,689
Saheb, Mayor Gupte is here to see you.

1439
01:41:28,828 --> 01:41:29,828
Shall I send him in?

1440
01:41:30,697 --> 01:41:31,697
Send him in.

1441
01:41:33,033 --> 01:41:34,057
Jai Maharashtra, Saheb.

1442
01:41:44,110 --> 01:41:45,771
Speak up, Mayor.

1443
01:41:46,046 --> 01:41:47,046
Sir that...

1444
01:41:47,747 --> 01:41:49,511
I said speak freely. Speak.

1445
01:42:03,730 --> 01:42:05,562
The populace has clearly decided...

1446
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:09,695
<i>The country and even the
state have chosen the 'Santa Party.</i>

1447
01:42:10,003 --> 01:42:10,697
And so?

1448
01:42:10,770 --> 01:42:13,762
Well, Shiv Sena's time is over.

1449
01:42:15,942 --> 01:42:19,071
I mean... it can't be forgotten
that we did fight our battle.

1450
01:42:19,946 --> 01:42:22,546
But in this election, people
have distanced themselves from you...

1451
01:42:23,917 --> 01:42:25,783
I mean from us.

1452
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:29,849
And so, a lot of us believe...

1453
01:42:30,624 --> 01:42:33,144
that if we think about
it from the political point of view...

1454
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:36,552
then we should merge
with the Janta Party.

1455
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:37,630
Hey...

1456
01:42:38,999 --> 01:42:39,999
Wait.

1457
01:42:40,934 --> 01:42:44,700
And anyway, the number
of violent people are increasing.

1458
01:42:45,005 --> 01:42:49,238
And how can anyone expect
any political sense from them'?

1459
01:42:58,652 --> 01:43:01,986
My organization was always for such
fearless people, and always will be.

1460
01:43:04,457 --> 01:43:06,537
Doctors like you who sell
colored water in bottles...

1461
01:43:06,993 --> 01:43:10,520
are mayor of this city because of them.

1462
01:43:10,597 --> 01:43:11,086
Sir...

1463
01:43:11,164 --> 01:43:12,689
And don't you forget that.

1464
01:43:14,601 --> 01:43:15,727
You're a doctor.

1465
01:43:18,772 --> 01:43:20,536
Even you have knives.

1466
01:43:22,042 --> 01:43:24,534
But you use to earn
a living for yourself...

1467
01:43:24,611 --> 01:43:26,931
and they use it to ensure
that others get a square meal.

1468
01:43:26,980 --> 01:43:28,004
There is a difference.

1469
01:43:30,850 --> 01:43:31,850
And one more thing.

1470
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:37,788
Those who want to quit
Shiv Sena can happily do so.

1471
01:43:39,192 --> 01:43:40,660
Even I'm left alone...

1472
01:43:41,461 --> 01:43:45,227
I'm still blessed with enough strength
to bring thousands of people together.

1473
01:43:47,233 --> 01:43:48,564
Sir...

1474
01:43:50,570 --> 01:43:52,664
And these violent
people you object about...

1475
01:43:53,540 --> 01:43:56,620
I will take this organization to new
heights with the help of these people.

1476
01:43:57,010 --> 01:43:59,672
Ya Hussein!

1477
01:43:59,746 --> 01:44:02,113
Ya Hussein!

1478
01:44:02,182 --> 01:44:04,776
Ya Hussein!

1479
01:44:04,851 --> 01:44:07,445
Ya Hussein!

1480
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:09,784
Ya Hussein!

1481
01:44:09,989 --> 01:44:12,583
Ya Hussein!

1482
01:44:12,659 --> 01:44:15,026
Ya Hussein!

1483
01:44:15,095 --> 01:44:17,427
Ya Hussein!

1484
01:44:19,866 --> 01:44:21,766
What is your problem
in saying Jai Maharashtra?

1485
01:44:22,936 --> 01:44:25,200
Let's forget about caste
and creed and do something good.

1486
01:44:26,573 --> 01:44:28,598
I am not against any
religion or community.

1487
01:44:29,542 --> 01:44:31,738
I believe in a man's deeds,
and not his religion.

1488
01:44:35,915 --> 01:44:36,973
But what is this?

1489
01:44:37,884 --> 01:44:43,550
Whenever India loses a match, some people
distribute sweets and burst crackers.

1490
01:44:44,124 --> 01:44:45,649
They celebrate.

1491
01:44:45,959 --> 01:44:47,688
Put a stop this.

1492
01:44:48,228 --> 01:44:49,992
If we stay together...

1493
01:44:50,463 --> 01:44:52,174
then those who pit us against
each other in the name of religion...

1494
01:44:52,198 --> 01:44:53,859
will soon have to quit this country.

1495
01:44:57,837 --> 01:45:00,932
Go ahead and celebrate Eid,
and we'll join you with enthusiasm.

1496
01:45:01,207 --> 01:45:06,202
But you must also celebrate Shiv Jayanti
with the same enthusiasm and joy.

1497
01:45:09,048 --> 01:45:12,848
- Jai Bhavani.
- Jai Shivaji.

1498
01:45:12,919 --> 01:45:15,183
- Jai Bhavani.
- Jai Shivaji.

1499
01:45:15,255 --> 01:45:17,053
- Jai Bhavani.
- Jai Shivaji.

1500
01:45:17,123 --> 01:45:20,616
- Jai Bhawani...
- Jai Shivaji!

1501
01:45:20,693 --> 01:45:24,891
- Jai Bhawani...
- Jai Shivaji!

1502
01:45:40,780 --> 01:45:42,714
Upstairs. Let's go upstairs.

1503
01:45:45,051 --> 01:45:46,610
You...

1504
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:49,712
Kill him. Kill him.

1505
01:45:55,795 --> 01:46:00,198
Whenever we tried to embrace them,
they tried to stab us in the back.

1506
01:46:02,635 --> 01:46:03,727
They are beyond help.

1507
01:46:06,606 --> 01:46:07,903
No more Muslim Leagues.

1508
01:46:09,976 --> 01:46:14,937
If the Muslims of this country want to
vote on the basis of religion, then...

1509
01:46:16,182 --> 01:46:19,015
We'll stay steadfast
on our ideology of Hindu religion.

1510
01:46:25,225 --> 01:46:27,193
Don't live like an <i>as****</i>

1511
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:28,819
Even dying is better.

1512
01:46:29,796 --> 01:46:31,560
Such helplessness for votes.

1513
01:46:34,701 --> 01:46:37,033
They think about Muslims
when they need votes.

1514
01:46:38,938 --> 01:46:43,899
From now on, those who talk about
Hindus will get to rule in India.

1515
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:48,580
I...

1516
01:46:49,115 --> 01:46:50,708
I said to Pramod Mahajan.

1517
01:46:53,052 --> 01:46:57,114
If a Maharashtrian can
cast his vote in Maharashtra...

1518
01:46:57,190 --> 01:46:59,852
then why can't Hindus do the same.

1519
01:47:01,194 --> 01:47:05,893
But today,
by making Ramesh Prabhu win...

1520
01:47:07,066 --> 01:47:09,347
you've shown the power
of Hindus to the entire country.

1521
01:47:13,072 --> 01:47:15,632
Even the court cannot stop
us from promoting the Hindu ideology.

1522
01:47:15,708 --> 01:47:17,608
No matter what the
decision of the court...

1523
01:47:17,911 --> 01:47:21,074
Shiv Sena will contest the elections
on the basis of Hindu ideology.

1524
01:47:23,783 --> 01:47:25,808
- Say it with pride...
- We're Hindus.

1525
01:47:25,885 --> 01:47:27,819
- Say it with pride...
- We're Hindus.

1526
01:47:27,887 --> 01:47:29,981
- Say it with pride...
- We're Hindus.

1527
01:47:30,056 --> 01:47:32,081
You provoked the
people with your speech.

1528
01:47:32,825 --> 01:47:35,851
And on your orders, your
people demolished the Babri Mosque.

1529
01:47:36,529 --> 01:47:39,021
Mosque? Which Mosque?

1530
01:47:41,267 --> 01:47:42,667
There was a Ram Temple, over there.

1531
01:47:43,803 --> 01:47:45,134
Lord Sri Ram's birthplace.

1532
01:47:47,674 --> 01:47:51,201
How do you know that
Lord Ram was born there'?

1533
01:47:51,878 --> 01:47:53,505
Was he born in Pakistan instead?

1534
01:47:55,848 --> 01:47:56,928
Maybe in Karachi or Lahore.

1535
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:01,520
Silence, please.

1536
01:48:02,155 --> 01:48:04,749
There were no birth
certificates back in those days...

1537
01:48:04,824 --> 01:48:06,451
which I could show you saying,

1538
01:48:06,526 --> 01:48:11,464
""Sir, this is the date of birth,
Sir, this is the place of birth"".

1539
01:48:11,965 --> 01:48:13,865
The people of India told me.

1540
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:15,500
Their faith told me.

1541
01:48:15,568 --> 01:48:18,162
They believe that Lord
Ram was born in that place.

1542
01:48:20,673 --> 01:48:23,165
Mr. Lawyer, can you answer a question?

1543
01:48:24,077 --> 01:48:25,077
What?

1544
01:48:25,578 --> 01:48:27,637
Do you know where Babur was born?

1545
01:48:30,783 --> 01:48:31,249
I don't know.

1546
01:48:31,517 --> 01:48:32,985
You don't, do you? I knew it.

1547
01:48:33,486 --> 01:48:34,486
Let me tell you.

1548
01:48:36,155 --> 01:48:38,647
Babur was born in what
is known as Uzbekistan now.

1549
01:48:39,692 --> 01:48:42,684
So is Uzbekistan in Ayodhya?

1550
01:48:45,565 --> 01:48:47,499
Look, I don't want to get into this.

1551
01:48:48,201 --> 01:48:51,136
But a few people's emotions
were attached to the structure...

1552
01:48:51,204 --> 01:48:52,831
which your people demolished.

1553
01:48:52,905 --> 01:48:54,498
No, we didn't demolish it.

1554
01:48:55,475 --> 01:48:56,874
We simply cleared it.

1555
01:48:57,076 --> 01:48:59,135
Hail Shri Ram!

1556
01:48:59,212 --> 01:49:01,544
Hail Shri Ram!

1557
01:49:01,614 --> 01:49:03,605
Hail Shri Ram!

1558
01:49:03,683 --> 01:49:05,811
Hail Shri Ram!

1559
01:49:05,885 --> 01:49:07,944
Hail Shri Ram!

1560
01:49:08,021 --> 01:49:10,080
Hail Shri Ram!

1561
01:49:10,189 --> 01:49:12,487
Hail Shri Ram!

1562
01:49:12,558 --> 01:49:14,583
Hail Shri Ram!

1563
01:49:14,694 --> 01:49:16,719
Hail Shri Ram!

1564
01:49:16,796 --> 01:49:19,094
Hail Shri Ram!

1565
01:49:20,133 --> 01:49:23,569
You mean you didn't do anything
wrong by demolishing the structure.

1566
01:49:24,604 --> 01:49:26,231
I wasn't even present there.

1567
01:49:27,874 --> 01:49:30,900
And the accusations you are levelling,
are against my people.

1568
01:49:31,544 --> 01:49:34,912
How is it possible that I will
stay quiet while you accuse my people'?

1569
01:49:35,581 --> 01:49:40,246
I live for my people.
I can't even leave them.

1570
01:49:40,753 --> 01:49:43,654
We were not involved
in whatever went down there.

1571
01:49:43,856 --> 01:49:48,259
In fact, we broke what was
an onslaught by a cruel power.

1572
01:49:49,762 --> 01:49:52,754
We only corrected,
what they had wronged.

1573
01:49:53,166 --> 01:49:56,625
Hail Shri Ram!

1574
01:49:56,702 --> 01:49:57,702
Order!

1575
01:49:57,870 --> 01:49:58,870
Order!

1576
01:50:01,207 --> 01:50:07,442
Hail Almighty!

1577
01:51:18,985 --> 01:51:20,612
- Throw that aside.
- Yes, sir.

1578
01:51:21,053 --> 01:51:23,647
Check on that side. Check.

1579
01:51:24,690 --> 01:51:25,987
You check on the right.

1580
01:51:31,063 --> 01:51:32,383
Bhalerao, you check on that side.

1581
01:51:32,498 --> 01:51:33,590
Yes sir.

1582
01:51:37,837 --> 01:51:39,828
- Anybody there?
- Checking, sir.

1583
01:51:55,721 --> 01:51:57,587
Shinde, anybody there?

1584
01:51:59,458 --> 01:52:00,458
No one, sir.

1585
01:52:03,529 --> 01:52:04,826
Okay, okay, let's go.

1586
01:52:19,011 --> 01:52:23,539
""Better than the entire world..""

1587
01:52:23,883 --> 01:52:28,184
""is our India.""

1588
01:52:28,721 --> 01:52:32,783
""We are its nightingales.""

1589
01:52:33,526 --> 01:52:37,121
""And this is our garden.""

1590
01:52:38,864 --> 01:52:39,626
Mother...

1591
01:52:39,699 --> 01:52:40,894
Amina, stay back.

1592
01:52:40,967 --> 01:52:42,230
Stay back.

1593
01:52:42,501 --> 01:52:44,162
We've been waiting since morning, sir.

1594
01:52:44,237 --> 01:52:46,831
Just two minutes, sir.

1595
01:52:47,039 --> 01:52:48,131
Sir...

1596
01:52:48,207 --> 01:52:52,166
Stay back. Let the car pass.

1597
01:52:52,245 --> 01:52:53,542
Sir...

1598
01:52:53,646 --> 01:52:54,646
Yes, sir.

1599
01:52:58,017 --> 01:53:00,418
I've been waiting here for three hours.

1600
01:53:00,486 --> 01:53:02,045
Just give me a few minutes.

1601
01:53:03,522 --> 01:53:04,522
Send them in.

1602
01:53:06,492 --> 01:53:07,492
Where do you stay?

1603
01:53:08,594 --> 01:53:10,062
Behram pada, sir.

1604
01:53:10,496 --> 01:53:11,554
My name is Amina.

1605
01:53:11,931 --> 01:53:14,491
He's my husband, Taahir.

1606
01:53:14,967 --> 01:53:17,902
And these are my children.

1607
01:53:18,771 --> 01:53:20,136
They burnt down our house.

1608
01:53:21,073 --> 01:53:22,700
And we've nowhere to go.

1609
01:53:23,843 --> 01:53:27,939
Please save us... Only
you can save us now.

1610
01:53:28,848 --> 01:53:30,907
Why do you keep looking at the watch?

1611
01:53:31,784 --> 01:53:33,718
Sir, it's time for... Prayers (Namaaz)

1612
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:38,889
It's time for my prayers ( Namaaz).

1613
01:53:42,628 --> 01:53:44,187
- You can pray here.
- No, sir.

1614
01:53:44,463 --> 01:53:46,158
I have no enmity against your religion.

1615
01:53:47,833 --> 01:53:49,873
My enmity is against those
infidels who resort to...

1616
01:53:49,902 --> 01:53:51,631
unrighteousness
in the name of religion.

1617
01:53:51,704 --> 01:53:52,848
Do you have a mat for praying?

1618
01:53:52,872 --> 01:53:54,465
No, sir. We've nothing left.

1619
01:53:54,507 --> 01:53:55,736
Everything was burned down.

1620
01:53:58,811 --> 01:54:00,506
- Ravi.
- Yes, sir.

1621
01:54:01,681 --> 01:54:03,547
- Give them a mat.
- Yes.

1622
01:54:18,130 --> 01:54:21,464
- What's your name, dear?
- My name is Asiya.

1623
01:54:39,151 --> 01:54:42,086
And not just the demolition
of the mosque, but even in Bombay...

1624
01:54:42,154 --> 01:54:43,451
That's Mumbai.

1625
01:54:44,023 --> 01:54:45,650
<i>Yes, Bombay.</i>

1626
01:54:45,725 --> 01:54:46,725
Mumbai!

1627
01:54:48,094 --> 01:54:50,586
You had a hand in the
riots that broke out in Mumbai, too.

1628
01:54:54,033 --> 01:54:55,057
No, I had a foot.

1629
01:54:58,104 --> 01:54:59,104
What?

1630
01:55:00,740 --> 01:55:05,075
I personally went to
every riot-affected area.

1631
01:55:07,613 --> 01:55:11,641
Even after committing numerous murders,
people were freely roaming the streets.

1632
01:55:12,118 --> 01:55:14,763
At such a time, there was a strong
need to bring them under control.

1633
01:55:14,787 --> 01:55:16,064
But that's a job for the Police.

1634
01:55:16,088 --> 01:55:16,611
Exactly.

1635
01:55:16,689 --> 01:55:17,769
It is a job for the Police.

1636
01:55:19,024 --> 01:55:20,584
But the Police are government servants.

1637
01:55:20,659 --> 01:55:23,179
They can't take action until they
don't get orders from the top.

1638
01:55:25,197 --> 01:55:28,565
And the people on the top simply sit in
their air-conditioned office doing nothing.

1639
01:55:28,634 --> 01:55:31,035
Because their politics
thrive on such riots.

1640
01:55:33,272 --> 01:55:35,900
If the Police are given
a free hand to do their job...

1641
01:55:35,975 --> 01:55:39,138
it will take them less
than half an hour to stop these riots.

1642
01:55:44,283 --> 01:55:47,150
Even you play such
politics based on riots.

1643
01:55:47,219 --> 01:55:50,746
No, I don't need to play politics.

1644
01:55:51,557 --> 01:55:55,790
But when my country is concerned,
I don't play political games.

1645
01:55:57,530 --> 01:55:59,521
You even do politics in games.

1646
01:56:00,766 --> 01:56:02,757
Sir. Sir,
please tell us what you talked about?

1647
01:56:02,835 --> 01:56:04,667
Sir, please tell us...

1648
01:56:04,737 --> 01:56:05,863
Sir, please...

1649
01:56:05,938 --> 01:56:07,235
Tell us, sir.

1650
01:56:07,506 --> 01:56:08,735
Move. Move.

1651
01:56:08,808 --> 01:56:10,469
Sir...

1652
01:56:10,543 --> 01:56:13,911
We want to know, please...

1653
01:56:19,685 --> 01:56:20,685
Who?

1654
01:56:20,753 --> 01:56:23,484
Please inform that Dilip Vengsarkar
and Javed Miandad have come.

1655
01:56:23,556 --> 01:56:24,148
Hello.

1656
01:56:24,523 --> 01:56:25,683
We have taken an appointment.

1657
01:56:27,126 --> 01:56:28,126
Okay.

1658
01:56:30,863 --> 01:56:33,491
Dilip Vengsarkar and
Javed Miandad are here?

1659
01:56:33,632 --> 01:56:34,632
Who?

1660
01:56:34,867 --> 01:56:37,131
Dilip Vengsarkar and
Javed Miandad are here?

1661
01:56:37,269 --> 01:56:38,269
What do we do?

1662
01:56:38,504 --> 01:56:40,199
Wait. Let me ask.

1663
01:56:45,811 --> 01:56:47,006
Send them in.

1664
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:48,680
Okay.

1665
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:57,849
Sir, Javed was in the
city for a TV program.

1666
01:56:58,224 --> 01:57:00,852
And he had a strong desire
to see you and meet you.

1667
01:57:00,926 --> 01:57:01,926
Okay.

1668
01:57:01,961 --> 01:57:02,553
Give it.

1669
01:57:02,628 --> 01:57:03,988
- So I brought him along.
- Thanks.

1670
01:57:04,029 --> 01:57:05,029
Try these fritters.

1671
01:57:05,831 --> 01:57:08,112
You will never taste anything
like this back in your home.

1672
01:57:12,505 --> 01:57:17,204
Sir, I've heard praises about
your passion and knowledge of cricket.

1673
01:57:18,978 --> 01:57:21,572
I had a wish...

1674
01:57:22,047 --> 01:57:25,210
I mean I had a request...

1675
01:57:26,085 --> 01:57:29,248
If we could resume playing
cricket with India again...

1676
01:57:31,190 --> 01:57:32,248
What's this Colonel?

1677
01:57:34,226 --> 01:57:35,226
What is he saying?

1678
01:57:36,228 --> 01:57:40,665
Yes, sir... without
your permission, they...

1679
01:57:45,638 --> 01:57:49,802
Yes, Saheb. If both countries
start playing cricket matches again...

1680
01:57:49,875 --> 01:57:52,003
then the condition can get much better.

1681
01:57:52,077 --> 01:57:53,077
Would you like a beer?

1682
01:57:54,513 --> 01:57:55,537
Beer... Sir.

1683
01:57:55,614 --> 01:57:56,979
No, thank you.

1684
01:57:59,919 --> 01:58:01,439
I still remember your shot, the sixer.

1685
01:58:02,521 --> 01:58:03,521
Excellent shot!

1686
01:58:03,756 --> 01:58:04,518
Thank you sir.

1687
01:58:04,590 --> 01:58:05,785
You played really well.

1688
01:58:08,227 --> 01:58:11,788
What was on your mind during that shot?

1689
01:58:13,032 --> 01:58:15,126
Nothing, in particular, Sir.

1690
01:58:16,068 --> 01:58:19,698
It was just a do and die situation,
so I just took that shot.

1691
01:58:23,242 --> 01:58:24,767
But honestly speaking sir,

1692
01:58:25,044 --> 01:58:29,242
that was the only bad ball
in the entire match by Chetan Sharma.

1693
01:58:30,082 --> 01:58:36,146
Otherwise, if you see his bowling
analysis, he played pretty well.

1694
01:58:36,689 --> 01:58:41,752
But after they lost, everyone
just pounced on him, unfortunately.

1695
01:58:41,827 --> 01:58:43,056
That's how it is.

1696
01:58:45,164 --> 01:58:49,032
We want to win every
battle against Pakistan.

1697
01:58:55,441 --> 01:59:00,811
Cricket is the only medium that can bring
harmony between both the countries.

1698
01:59:07,953 --> 01:59:08,953
What do you think?

1699
01:59:10,189 --> 01:59:11,189
No, sir...

1700
01:59:11,924 --> 01:59:16,486
I was thinking that you
shouldn't put a stop cricket.

1701
01:59:16,562 --> 01:59:18,587
Please let both the countries play.

1702
01:59:18,764 --> 01:59:20,755
By Grace of Allah,
it will be better for us.

1703
01:59:23,569 --> 01:59:27,062
You think about the game and I...

1704
01:59:29,241 --> 01:59:31,642
think about my country
that plays cricket.

1705
01:59:36,882 --> 01:59:37,906
One more thing...

1706
01:59:38,717 --> 01:59:41,118
Your batting wasn't good
enough to make me forget...

1707
01:59:41,754 --> 01:59:45,748
the pain of those families
that lost a member at the border.

1708
01:59:46,125 --> 01:59:47,125
Drink your tea.

1709
01:59:52,531 --> 01:59:56,900
By the way, sir, even the government
wants to talk to you on this issue.

1710
02:00:00,806 --> 02:00:06,506
In order to play one needs
a ground and not the government.

1711
02:02:01,727 --> 02:02:05,061
Saheb, we took four men
in custody some days ago.

1712
02:02:06,431 --> 02:02:07,796
We even questioned them.

1713
02:02:09,067 --> 02:02:13,061
According to the
information they gave us...

1714
02:02:14,973 --> 02:02:15,872
Speak up.

1715
02:02:15,941 --> 02:02:17,841
It was a conspiracy
to murder you, Saheb.

1716
02:02:20,546 --> 02:02:22,537
We were lucky to know in advance...

1717
02:02:22,614 --> 02:02:25,515
but we acted immediately
as we got the information.

1718
02:02:34,126 --> 02:02:35,218
Who were they?

1719
02:03:22,574 --> 02:03:25,100
Miyan, the chicken is simply delicious.

1720
02:03:25,644 --> 02:03:26,839
Now serve me kebabs.

1721
02:03:27,846 --> 02:03:28,870
Shinde.

1722
02:03:44,129 --> 02:03:45,722
No, sir...

1723
02:03:45,797 --> 02:03:46,958
No, sir...

1724
02:03:47,499 --> 02:03:49,024
No, sir...

1725
02:03:49,468 --> 02:03:50,833
No, sir...

1726
02:03:54,006 --> 02:03:55,030
Miyan...

1727
02:03:57,643 --> 02:03:58,701
No, sir...

1728
02:03:58,977 --> 02:03:59,739
Sir. Sir.

1729
02:03:59,811 --> 02:04:01,506
Remember anything.

1730
02:04:04,683 --> 02:04:09,484
Last year... we planned
to kill Thackeray...

1731
02:04:09,554 --> 02:04:10,953
You...

1732
02:04:13,692 --> 02:04:15,490
Thackeray Saheb.

1733
02:04:16,628 --> 02:04:17,720
Thackeray...

1734
02:04:18,764 --> 02:04:19,764
Thackeray...

1735
02:04:20,032 --> 02:04:21,193
Saheb.

1736
02:04:21,633 --> 02:04:22,099
Saheb.

1737
02:04:22,167 --> 02:04:23,430
Thackeray...

1738
02:04:23,502 --> 02:04:23,968
Thackeray...

1739
02:04:24,036 --> 02:04:25,060
Saheb...

1740
02:04:25,137 --> 02:04:26,137
Saheb...

1741
02:04:26,438 --> 02:04:27,438
Continue.

1742
02:04:28,974 --> 02:04:32,604
We had planned to kill
Bal Thackeray in Bhawan.

1743
02:04:33,178 --> 02:04:34,646
But it failed.

1744
02:04:36,048 --> 02:04:39,746
So, this time we planned to
kill him during the rally on Dussera.

1745
02:04:41,620 --> 02:04:43,110
I live in Bar-tare.

1746
02:04:43,622 --> 02:04:44,453
Sir, take this.

1747
02:04:44,523 --> 02:04:45,922
I met uncle Naeem over there.

1748
02:04:47,025 --> 02:04:48,754
He introduced us to the master mind.

1749
02:04:49,161 --> 02:04:50,925
And then we started with the training.

1750
02:04:52,097 --> 02:04:54,498
They explained us the
entire map of this area.

1751
02:04:54,700 --> 02:04:56,168
And the master mind said that.

1752
02:04:56,802 --> 02:04:58,702
You will attain salvation..

1753
02:04:59,004 --> 02:05:00,768
If you do this.

1754
02:05:41,013 --> 02:05:43,880
- Has this case gone on record yet?
- No.

1755
02:05:48,153 --> 02:05:51,987
After today, make sure no one should
ever know about this ever.

1756
02:05:52,691 --> 02:05:53,157
Sir.

1757
02:05:53,225 --> 02:05:55,626
Every trivial issue
is used to spark riots here.

1758
02:05:55,694 --> 02:05:57,685
And it's our own people
that die in these riots.

1759
02:05:57,763 --> 02:06:00,198
But Saheb, you must be careful.

1760
02:06:00,699 --> 02:06:05,034
I mean if you can avoid going out
for a few days, then it'll be better.

1761
02:06:05,670 --> 02:06:07,035
And definitely not out of Mumbai.

1762
02:06:07,105 --> 02:06:08,573
Why? Scared of these as****?

1763
02:06:11,076 --> 02:06:12,356
Elections are around the corner.

1764
02:06:13,512 --> 02:06:16,152
I'll have to make a tour of Maharastra
for promotions and meetings.

1765
02:06:17,816 --> 02:06:20,251
And my Sainiks are
capable of protecting me.

1766
02:06:20,986 --> 02:06:22,215
Why take a risk, sir?

1767
02:06:31,963 --> 02:06:34,057
The color of bullet
that touches my body...

1768
02:06:34,132 --> 02:06:37,033
That colour will be wiped from the
face of this country, Officer.

1769
02:06:52,184 --> 02:06:54,846
All my Hindu brothers,
sisters, and my Mothers!

1770
02:07:05,664 --> 02:07:07,496
I don't believe in democracy.

1771
02:07:07,999 --> 02:07:10,764
Democracy never existed
in this country.

1772
02:07:14,940 --> 02:07:17,637
They question me whether
I am Mumbai's Hitler?

1773
02:07:17,709 --> 02:07:20,178
Not just Mumbai,
I am the Hitler of entire Maharashtra.

1774
02:07:20,245 --> 02:07:22,205
And someday I'll become
this country's Hitler too.

1775
02:07:23,482 --> 02:07:25,610
If you can't maintain Law and Order...

1776
02:07:26,017 --> 02:07:30,250
then I'll have to give
guns to all my Sainiks.

1777
02:07:33,525 --> 02:07:37,189
I don't mind if my Shiv Sainiks are
called goons, but I don't want cowards.

1778
02:07:39,798 --> 02:07:43,701
Shiv Sena Bhawan was attacked,
There was an attack attempted on me...

1779
02:07:43,768 --> 02:07:45,568
and you want my Shiv
Sainiks to stay quiet?

1780
02:07:45,804 --> 02:07:47,272
I don't need to give orders.

1781
02:07:47,772 --> 02:07:49,612
The Hindus were enraged... and
riots broke out.

1782
02:07:55,614 --> 02:07:56,877
What Aurangabad?

1783
02:07:57,516 --> 02:07:58,950
Why remember that tyrant Aurangzeb?

1784
02:07:59,651 --> 02:08:03,849
If you want to remember someone,
then remember Sambhaji Maharaj.

1785
02:08:04,523 --> 02:08:05,752
No more Aurangabad.

1786
02:08:06,758 --> 02:08:09,693
From today we'll call
this land as Sambhaji Nagar.

1787
02:08:14,699 --> 02:08:17,066
The Shiv Sena President
doesn't need to give orders.

1788
02:08:17,135 --> 02:08:22,471
It's my Sainik's responsibility that no one
dares to raise even an eyebrow on women.

1789
02:08:26,978 --> 02:08:28,070
Police are attacked.

1790
02:08:28,547 --> 02:08:31,539
If the Police are insecure,
then what about the public.

1791
02:08:31,750 --> 02:08:33,684
My message to those
Police officers are...

1792
02:08:33,752 --> 02:08:35,618
that this is the
land of Shivaji Maharaj.

1793
02:08:35,687 --> 02:08:37,781
Who are you scared of?
Why are you scared?

1794
02:08:37,956 --> 02:08:40,316
If someone dares to raise
a hand on you, then take him down.

1795
02:08:40,859 --> 02:08:42,759
You have my support.

1796
02:08:49,067 --> 02:08:51,661
Don't mistake these for waves,
because this is an ocean.

1797
02:08:51,937 --> 02:08:54,770
And it will stay this way.

1798
02:08:54,839 --> 02:08:57,618
The orange flag of Shivaji's reign will
flutter in the skies of Maharashtra...

1799
02:08:57,642 --> 02:08:59,474
and I will make sure it does.

1800
02:08:59,778 --> 02:09:01,769
This is my promise to you.

1801
02:09:20,999 --> 02:09:23,127
The Shiv Sena BJP alliance

1802
02:09:23,201 --> 02:09:26,762
has opened doors for Shiv
Sena to the CM's post.

1803
02:09:26,838 --> 02:09:32,777
For the first time in history, on 14th
March 1995, in Shivaji Park Dadar...

1804
02:09:32,844 --> 02:09:37,611
Mr.Manohar Joshi from Shiv Sena
will swear in as the Prime Minister...

1805
02:09:56,935 --> 02:09:59,063
I, Manohar Gajanan Joshi.

1806
02:09:59,971 --> 02:10:01,905
Swear in the name of god...

1807
02:10:03,008 --> 02:10:10,916
that I will bear true faith and
allegiance to the Constitution of India.

1808
02:10:13,718 --> 02:10:19,213
That I will uphold the sovereignty
and integrity of India...

1809
02:10:20,792 --> 02:10:23,557
that I will faithfully and
conscientiously discharge my duties...

1810
02:10:23,628 --> 02:10:26,893
as a Chief Minister
for the state of Maharashtra...

1811
02:10:27,832 --> 02:10:31,530
and that I will do right to all

1812
02:10:32,070 --> 02:10:36,507
manner of people in accordance
with the Constitution...

1813
02:10:36,775 --> 02:10:40,541
and the law, without fear or favor,
affection or ill-will.

1814
02:10:40,879 --> 02:10:43,678
I, Manohar Gajanan Joshi.

1815
02:10:43,848 --> 02:10:45,816
Swear in the name of God

1816
02:10:46,184 --> 02:10:51,987
I will not directly
or indirectly communicate

1817
02:10:52,057 --> 02:10:55,755
or reveal to any person or persons...

1818
02:10:56,094 --> 02:11:00,053
any matter which shall
be brought under my consideration...

1819
02:11:00,131 --> 02:11:03,829
or shall become known
to me as a Minister...

1820
02:11:03,902 --> 02:11:07,634
for the state of Maharashtra
except as may be required...

1821
02:11:07,772 --> 02:11:14,439
for the due discharge
of my duties as such Minister.

1822
02:11:40,839 --> 02:11:43,900
Do you plead guilty or not guilty?

1823
02:11:45,076 --> 02:11:46,168
Yes.

1824
02:11:49,514 --> 02:11:50,606
I plead guilty.

1825
02:11:54,886 --> 02:11:59,187
If loving this country is a crime,
then I am a criminal.

1826
02:12:03,128 --> 02:12:06,462
If caring for my people is a crime,
then I am a criminal.

1827
02:12:07,866 --> 02:12:11,632
People are not for the Law,
the Law is for the people.

1828
02:12:14,205 --> 02:12:17,573
The country has always
made me stand in this witness box...

1829
02:12:17,742 --> 02:12:20,662
but the people of this country will
decide whether I am right or wrong.

1830
02:12:20,779 --> 02:12:24,841
Because I only believe in one court,
and that's the people's court.

1831
02:12:28,720 --> 02:12:36,650
I gave courage to those whose spines
were shattered by this Capitalism.

1832
02:12:36,728 --> 02:12:37,854
Is that my crime?

1833
02:12:40,832 --> 02:12:43,733
This system which gagged
the society for many years...

1834
02:12:43,868 --> 02:12:46,180
I became the society's voice
and challenged this system.

1835
02:12:46,204 --> 02:12:46,898
Is that my crime?

1836
02:12:46,971 --> 02:12:49,565
And if that is a crime,
then I'm prepared to do it again.

1837
02:12:54,779 --> 02:12:57,979
In this system, it becomes necessary to
resort to violence after a point of time.

1838
02:12:58,183 --> 02:12:59,183
I was an artist.

1839
02:13:00,452 --> 02:13:01,852
First I used my brush as my weapon.

1840
02:13:01,986 --> 02:13:04,421
But, when it was incapable
of giving justice to the people...

1841
02:13:04,489 --> 02:13:08,585
just like our judicial system,
then I believed it was necessary...

1842
02:13:08,660 --> 02:13:10,924
to resort to every kind
of violence for justice.

1843
02:13:11,563 --> 02:13:12,587
It was justified.

1844
02:13:13,465 --> 02:13:15,627
And our history is
full of such examples.

1845
02:13:16,601 --> 02:13:18,035
Yes, I plead guilty.

1846
02:13:22,807 --> 02:13:27,608
And, even if you hang me
for this crime, I still accept.

1847
02:13:28,947 --> 02:13:33,043
Every crime I committed shall run through
the blood of my people as an ideology...

1848
02:13:33,117 --> 02:13:37,645
and this Bal Keshav Thackeray shall
thrive in every drop of that blood!

1849
02:14:25,003 --> 02:14:27,472
""Heart filled With light.""

1850
02:14:28,940 --> 02:14:30,874
""And a body that glows like amber.""

1851
02:14:32,810 --> 02:14:38,078
""Courage... like none other.""

1852
02:14:40,485 --> 02:14:45,480
""The leader... of the people.""

1853
02:14:45,557 --> 02:14:48,185
""The leader...""

1854
02:14:48,459 --> 02:14:54,455
""You are their protector.""

1855
02:14:56,467 --> 02:15:00,028
""Those without any help or support...""

1856
02:15:00,104 --> 02:15:04,041
""you became their backbone.""

1857
02:15:04,108 --> 02:15:07,942
""You are Saheb, you are the government.""

1858
02:15:08,012 --> 02:15:11,846
""You are the great leader.""

1859
02:15:11,916 --> 02:15:15,750
""You are Saheb, you are the government.""

1860
02:15:15,820 --> 02:15:19,688
""You are the great leader.""

1861
02:16:04,736 --> 02:16:09,503
""You chose the path of
truth and honesty.""

1862
02:16:09,574 --> 02:16:13,477
""You dwelled in every heart,
and heard their plea.""

1863
02:16:13,544 --> 02:16:17,174
""You showered everyone
with your generosity.""

1864
02:16:17,248 --> 02:16:19,216
""You welcomed everyone.

1865
02:16:19,550 --> 02:16:23,680
""And became one with them.""

1866
02:16:25,023 --> 02:16:28,823
""You defeated every evil.""

1867
02:16:28,893 --> 02:16:32,727
""You took on all the pain,
while spreading happiness.""

1868
02:16:32,797 --> 02:16:36,563
""You fought for everyone's happiness...""

1869
02:16:36,634 --> 02:16:41,538
""till your last breath
you thought only for the country.""

1870
02:16:42,974 --> 02:16:46,706
""The one who had nowhere to go...""

1871
02:16:46,844 --> 02:16:50,803
""you became their backbone.""

1872
02:16:50,982 --> 02:16:54,282
""You are Saheb, you are the government.""

1873
02:16:54,519 --> 02:16:58,547
""You are the great leader.

1874
02:16:58,623 --> 02:17:02,116
""You are Saheb, you are the government.""

1875

""You are the great leader""

tt2063745,Kya Dilli Kya Lahore,"1
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:55,125
Long years ago we made
a tryst with destiny.

2
00:01:55,458 --> 00:02:00,458
And now the time comes
when we shall redeem our pledge.

3
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:06,333
Not wholly or in full measure,
but very substantially.

4
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:12,375
It marks the fulfillment of
the destiny of the Muslim nation...

5
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:18,750
...which has laid great sacrifices in
the past few years to make Pakistan.

6
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,750
At the beginning of the partition of the
country people were migrating...

7
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:26,042
...from both sides of the border.

8
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:29,417
More than 25 lakh people had come from
Pakistan to Delhi from Nirmal...

9
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:32,917
...Monkumri, Beerpur,
Lahore... through Amritsar...

10
00:02:33,042 --> 00:02:36,750
...Ferozpur and Bikaner.

11
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:39,750
Whereas nearly the same
number of people...

12
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,167
...from India from Uttar Pradesh,
Punjab, Haryana...

13
00:02:42,417 --> 00:02:46,292
...Himachal Pradesh and other different
states had reached Karachi...

14
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:49,917
...Mirpur, Sukul and Lahore.

15
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:09,667
'Let the lines remain as it is.'

16
00:03:09,917 --> 00:03:12,750
'Maybe someone had
drawn it in rage.'

17
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:19,667
'Make it a court and let's
play 'Kabaddi' (An Indian game).'

18
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:22,875
'Let the lines remain as it is.'

19
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,042
'You come to my side
and challenge me.'

20
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,625
'Smack my hand and run.'

21
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:35,375
'I will catch you,
cling to you, pull your leg.'

22
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:37,792
'And not let you go back.'

23
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:45,750
'When I come to your side,
you also catch me.'

24
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:51,042
'Don't let me touch
the boundary line.'

25
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,417
'That someone had drawn in rage.'

26
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,917
'Make it a court and
let's play 'Kabaddi'.'

27

'Let the lines remain as it is.'

28

'Let the lines remain as it is.'

29
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,958
Water.

30
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,875
Water.

31
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,458
Yes, sir.

32
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,750
Are you fine, sir?

33
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,000
Shut up. Were you fleeing? - No.

34
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,958
File. I want the file. - File?

35
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,125
The file of the tunnel
from Delhi to Lahore.

36
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,708
There... in the Indian post.

37
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,458
Wake them up.

38
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:12,708
Whom, sir?

39
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:16,500
Your scoundrel comrades.
They are sleeping.

40
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:17,458
Wake them up.

41
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:22,875
No, sir. They are Pakistani
soldiers. They are dead.

42
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:26,375
Did you die? - No. I am alive.

43
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,250
So go. Get the file
from the Indian post.

44
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,833
Go.

45
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,750
Me? - Who else? Me? You fool.

46
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,250
Can't you see? I have been shot.

47
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,708
I should go alone, sir?

48
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,250
You should have brought your father.

49
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,875
Sir, I will bring help. - Not help.

50
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,749
I want the file. I want the file.

51
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,833
Immigrant.

52
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,000
Bring it, son.

53
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,833
This is your chance.
God has given you the chance.

54
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,250
To prove yourself a true Pakistani.

55
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,375
Go.

56
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:20,500
Show your country that
you are a true Pakistani.

57
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:21,750
Go.

58
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:31,625
Go. Otherwise I will prove
that your entire family is traitor.

59
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,750
A burden on our country.

60
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,167
Go.

61
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:40,917
Yes, sir.

62
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,042
Are you going...

63
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:17,917
Sir, the firing has been
going on for the past one hour.

64
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,292
Are you sure?

65
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,375
I am sure. I mean, why will I lie?

66
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:25,292
They must have gone for a stroll.

67
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:27,667
Exactly, sir.
They go for a stroll everyday.

68
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,792
But they return
within 15-20 minutes.

69
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,292
But today it's been
more than an hour.

70
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,667
Sir, I am scared.

71
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:42,167
Sir, did you hear the firing?

72
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,625
Sir, what do I tell you?

73
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:51,875
There are 'Dadu' in their backside.

74
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:53,500
In which language
are you talking today?

75
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:54,792
What is 'Dadu'?

76
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,667
'Dadu'...

77
00:09:58,167 --> 00:09:59,667
God bless you.

78
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:03,875
Sir, in Punjabi language
frog is called 'Dadu'.

79
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,667
There are many of them.

80
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,542
They fire at trivial matters.

81
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:11,042
And there are many
of them in this area.

82
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:13,250
Shut up. - What? Yes. Yes, sir.

83
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:15,292
Be alert. I will do something.

84
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:19,667
Sir, I am alone here.
How can I be alert?

85
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,542
A soldier is never alone.

86
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,375
Entire India is with him.

87
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:28,500
Yes. Fine. You are right. But...

88
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:30,417
But I am alone.

89
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:32,750
If you are afraid,
why did you join the army?

90
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:36,250
I have joined the army to cook.

91
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:40,042
I am a cook. I cook food. - Shut up.

92
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,750
What? - We will find
out about your comrades.

93
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:44,667
Yes. - Inform me
if you get any news.

94
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,917
A cook can't use his brains.

95
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,292
There is no water. I will fetch it.

96
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:16,125
What will he lose?

97
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,667
God, protect me.

98
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,292
O Lord. O Lord.

99
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:31,250
Why have they made it so far?

100
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:01,667
Raghu.

101
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:04,167
Help! Help! - He...

102
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,125
I think there is only one.

103
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,417
Mister.

104
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:58,542
Brother.

105
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:05,500
Sir.

106
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,917
You have not come to drink water,
have you?

107
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:17,167
I mean, are you thirsty, sir?

108
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,167
Or have you lost your way?

109
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:31,792
Look, if somebody loses his way,
even if he is a Pakistani...

110
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:33,792
...I don't say anything to him.

111
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:34,917
I swear.

112
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:40,917
If you want, you can leave quietly.

113
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:45,792
O Lord.

114
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,250
I am telling you. Leave quietly.

115
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:02,125
I promise you.
I won't say anything to you. Leave.

116
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:05,667
And I won't tell anyone.

117
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:08,375
To whom will you tell, you fool?

118
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,625
I have killed everyone.

119
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:16,167
All are sleeping peacefully.

120
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:17,917
Are you listening?

121
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:19,917
I have not come to leave.

122
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,750
I have come to take the file. File.

123
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:23,792
Moron.

124
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,125
Are you listening?

125
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,375
Give me the file quietly.

126
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:32,291
If you want to live.

127
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,917
Otherwise I will fire ceaselessly.

128
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,625
In a minute you will
go straight to heaven.

129
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:38,667
What file?

130
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,042
The tunnel file.

131
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:45,000
It has the map of the tunnel.

132
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,250
What file?

133
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:47,792
Which tunnel?

134
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:52,292
The tunnel that you are digging
from Red Fort to Lahore.

135
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:53,750
You have taken everything from us.

136
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,125
At least leave this for us.

137
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,875
Brother, I swear on God.
I don't understand anything.

138
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,875
Give me the file quietly.

139
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:02,792
What file?

140
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,458
The tunnel, the digging,
these are what officers do.

141
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,333
How will a cook like
me know about all this?

142
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,708
My job is to cook.
Not to dig a tunnel.

143
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,583
You fool, you are a cook?

144
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:19,750
Yes.

145
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,500
Look. Unnecessarily I was scared.
Tell me.

146
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,458
Look, I don't argue with cooks.

147
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,583
Tell me. Where is the file?

148
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:36,250
I swear on my mother.
I don't know anything about the file.

149
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,833
Nothing.

150
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,250
Okay. What can you cook? Tell me.

151
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,958
Everything.

152
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,583
Okra.

153
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,958
Bitter gourd. Mince meat.

154
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,583
I can cook anything you want.

155
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:52,083
Fine. I will make you
cook in the Pakistani army.

156
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,875
Cook well.

157
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,750
Personally I love
potato stuffed flatbread.

158
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,875
Yes.

159
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,625
I suggest join hands with me.
Come with me to Pakistan.

160
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,833
You will lead a luxurious life.

161
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,250
Are you listening?

162
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,458
Moron. - You fool.

163
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,875
You... I am talking
to you affectionately.

164
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,333
And you are firing.

165
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,500
You have showed you are a cook.
- Your father is a cook.

166
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,458
You will make me cook.

167
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,750
Call me a cook once more.

168
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:31,250
Change my name if I
don't teach you a lesson.

169
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,375
Cook. - You...

170
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,000
Come in front of me.

171
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,000
You are scared now?

172
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,083
You fool.

173
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,625
Scoundrel. Rascal.

174
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,875
You soldier!

175
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,250
Will you capture my country?

176
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,333
Why are abusing me? Am I abusing you?

177
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,000
I am talking to you so affectionately.

178
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,875
Where did you go, Harban Singh?

179
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:03,625
I called you brother.

180
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,375
You don't understand our feelings.

181
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,750
We gave you everything.

182
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,000
You didn't do any favor on us.

183
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,500
You loaded your pockets
and gave us a few pennies.

184
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,125
On top of that bloodshed.
- Who did bloodshed?

185
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,708
Scoundrel.

186
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,625
Did you send a truck full
of dead bodies? Or did we send it?

187
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,875
Read the newspaper.

188
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,375
The first truck came from India,
bathed with blood.

189
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,750
You didn't even spare children.

190
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,625
You also read our newspaper.

191
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,250
Why should I read the newspaper?

192
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:35,833
With my own hands I have
picked up my kin's pieces.

193
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,583
Didn't we?

194
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,875
We are still searching
for our relatives.

195
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,125
You wanted to make your
own political parties.

196
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:46,833
Scoundrel.

197
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,750
What political parties
did we Hindus make?

198
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,375
Hindus and Muslims
are still living together...

199
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,875
...in every neighborhood.

200
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,375
Come and count.

201
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,333
And they are happy too.

202
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,375
Happy my foot.

203
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Why don't you come and ask them?

204
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,500
Some of your relatives
must still be here.

205
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,875
They are cowards who
are still staying here.

206
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,375
I will never even look at them.

207
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,833
Keep quiet.

208
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,333
Tell me. What do you want?

209
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,500
Right. My right.

210
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:19,208
What right? Tell me.

211
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,750
This land is ours. It's our right.

212
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:29,500
Come. It's in my pocket.
Come and take it.

213
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,875
Look, give me the tunnel file quietly.
I will leave.

214
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,125
Get lost.

215
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,625
Keep quiet.

216
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,625
Come and take it.
I told you. It's in my pocket.

217
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,125
He...

218
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,125
Are your bullets over? Pakistani!

219
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,250
I have enough for you.

220
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,333
Nonsense. Nothing is enough for you.

221
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,750
Those whose intention is bad,
their lives are rancorous.

222
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,375
Give us our right. Equal right.

223
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,625
We gave it to you as per your stature.

224
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,083
Okay. What is our stature? Tell me.

225
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,583
Not a penny more than 45 crores.

226
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,750
We appealed.
That's why you got 65 crores.

227
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,250
We didn't get even Rs.65.

228
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,625
Why are you telling us?
We gave it to you.

229
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,750
Take it from your fathers.

230
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,375
Who took the decision?

231
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:37,083
Even your Mr. Nehru never doubted
Mr. Jinnah's intention.

232
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,625
That's why we gave it
to you as an elder brother.

233
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,000
Had you considered
us your elder brother...

234
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,333
...Pakistan would
have never been created.

235
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,208
You know? He is so ill nowadays.

236
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,375
I know. I also read the newspaper.

237
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,875
When he was so aged,
what was the need to enter politics?

238
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,000
He would have taught you something.

239
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:02,500
He was more worldly-wise
than your Mr. Nehru.

240
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,458
We called him uncle Nehru.

241
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,458
But you turned out
to be his real nephew.

242
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,875
He had come to my school.

243
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,625
I gave him two roses.

244
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,250
Others gave him one.

245
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,708
He was a capable man.

246
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,500
That's why you also
gave him two roses.

247
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,250
You should have told your
relatives about his capability.

248
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,250
We wouldn't have had
to see this day today.

249
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,500
It was just a small issue.
But you were so stubborn.

250
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,375
Give it to us. We want this.

251
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,125
What small issue?

252
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,125
It all happened for political seats.

253
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:39,208
Ruined everything for that.

254
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,875
I lost everything.

255
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,333
Otherwise I wouldn't
have been standing here...

256
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:48,708
...and arguing with you.

257
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,125
I would have also not
been arguing with you.

258
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,875
I am not a cook.

259
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,250
I have a huge mansion in Lahore.

260
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,000
My father was a moneylender.

261
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:04,375
I had 100 servants like you.

262
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,500
They would massage my father's feet.

263
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:08,500
And here, my status is nothing.

264
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,333
Yes. Everybody was a moneylender.

265
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,250
Where in Lahore?

266
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:20,750
Anarkali Bazaar.

267
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:26,875
Go to Red Mosque and then
from Akbari lane go straight.

268
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,000
And ask anyone.

269
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,625
You will find Nehle Shah's mansion.

270
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,375
Liar.

271
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,375
You captured Lahore.

272
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,625
And we are liars.

273
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,625
Okay. Fine.
I will find out right away.

274
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,000
You know Afzal Qureshi?

275
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:46,208
He is an aged man.
Give him some respect.

276
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,750
At least say uncle Afzal.

277
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:52,083
His son Rizwan and
I were childhood friends.

278
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,458
We have celebrated
'Eid'(Muslim festival)...

279
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,500
...and 'Diwali'
(Hindu festival) together.

280
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,458
What nonsense!

281
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:59,083
He had seized yours' colony.

282
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,708
He said, ""I will give
it to those whom it belongs.""

283
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,750
When the matter will cool down,
they will come.

284
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,374
As if we will allow you to come.

285
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:10,374
We won't come. Get lost.

286
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,250
Take your Pakistan
that you have created.

287
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:18,125
You are talking about seizing.
It's not called seizing.

288
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,125
It's called maintaining friendship.

289
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,375
Listen. It's not friendship.

290
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,250
He wanted to give
it to his loved ones.

291
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:30,083
Yes. When he was thrashed,
he ran away.

292
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:31,333
Talk respectfully.

293
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:35,208
Uncle Afzal would have died.

294
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:39,750
But not let scoundrels
like you touch any of the houses.

295
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,250
We had handed it to him.

296
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,208
Saying we will come back.

297
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,000
What did we know?
We will have to stay here.

298
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:53,375
My father wrote to him
saying we can't come now.

299
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,583
That's how you got our houses.

300
00:24:57,625 --> 00:24:58,875
Through custodian.

301
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:02,083
When you had so much affinity,
why did you leave?

302
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:09,000
You scoundrel.

303
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:16,583
Hey, Pakistani.

304
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:04,750
Watchman.

305
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:20,250
Are you sleeping?

306
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:34,625
Did you die during the night?

307
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,500
He is not talking.

308
00:28:06,958 --> 00:28:09,125
The potatoes are delicious.

309
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:13,000
You are giving your
brother a measly meal.

310
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,958
You should have prepared
stuffed flatbread.

311
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:19,708
Delicious.

312
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:22,250
May God grant you 15 minutes of life!

313
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:24,125
What else are you feeding me?

314
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,875
Want bullets?

315
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,750
Tell me.

316
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,125
Want it on your face or on your back?

317
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:37,083
Is it your father's wedding feast?
You scoundrel.

318
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:40,500
You fool.

319
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:42,833
If you had any bullets,
would you have thrown potatoes?

320
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:50,000
Where is it?

321
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:59,833
Don't be under this misunderstanding,
Pakistani.

322
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,625
I have so many bullets.

323
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,250
So many ammunitions.

324
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,250
How many ammunitions do you have?

325
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,625
Why should I tell you?

326
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:15,250
One bullet is enough for you.

327
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:18,458
Fine. Forget this account.

328
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:22,500
Tell me. How long will
you make me sit here?

329
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:25,833
If you are scared, why don't you flee?

330
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:31,208
Take your Allah's name,
race and reach Pakistan.

331
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,125
Otherwise you will die.

332
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,250
I won't leave without the file.

333
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:37,375
Change my name.

334
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:44,250
So sit there. What do I care?

335
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:47,500
Our troop has left from there.

336
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:52,250
When they are going to shoot your
backside, than you will see the tunnel.

337
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:57,875
Later don't tell
me I didn't inform you.

338
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:04,500
You fool. Even my troop is coming.

339
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:08,250
Not one.
But four of them. From all sides.

340
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:12,375
I am not afraid of any troop.
Scaring me with a troop.

341
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:16,875
Let it be.

342
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:19,833
You will have to pay a huge price.
Let me tell you.

343
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:22,625
You also will have
to pay a heavy price.

344
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,375
Why do you want to die?

345
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:30,750
Don't you get it?

346
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:33,250
Listen.

347
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,500
Let's make a settlement.

348
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:38,500
Give me the file quietly.

349
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:40,500
You go to your home
and I will go to my home.

350
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:41,500
Okay?

351
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,083
Look, I will give you nothing.

352
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:51,708
If you need it, you tell me.
What will you give me?

353
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,833
Look, listen to me.
I am not in the mood to fight.

354
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,875
Will you take my chain?

355
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:08,000
What chain?

356
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:11,250
It's my wife's.
I got it during my marriage.

357
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:13,250
You fool.

358
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:15,500
Is it silver or gold? Tell me.

359
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,875
It's silver. Pure silver.

360
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:19,000
Weighing 29 grams.

361
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:20,375
You can open your own hotel.

362
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:25,958
No. No. I think if
I have to open a hotel...

363
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:31,750
...I will need at least 70 grams.

364
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:34,833
If I had 70 grams,
what would I be doing here?

365
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,708
Okay. Tell me. What else do you have?

366
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:47,833
Watch .

367
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,333
It's working?

368
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,250
It works 24 hours.

369
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,249
There are 12 hours in a watch.

370
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,000
Yours works 24 hours?

371
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,250
Yes. I mean the same thing.

372
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:02,500
Tell me the time.

373
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:05,208
6:30.

374
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:09,250
It's 7:00 in my clock.

375
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:11,000
Your watch is not functioning.

376
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:15,375
Yes. You are half an hour ahead of us.

377
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:21,875
Thank God. At least you admitted.

378
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:25,625
That we are ahead of
you and you are behind us.

379
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:27,083
Right?

380
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,958
If you accept the deal, tell me.
Otherwise end the matter.

381
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,833
Fine. Do one thing.
Throw the watch and the chain.

382
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:38,875
First throw the file.

383
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,125
Why are you laughing?

384
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:47,500
Do you need the file or do I need it?

385
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:49,458
I do.

386
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:51,333
Tell me.

387
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:54,125
You or me?

388
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,750
What if you go back on your word?

389
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:01,208
Don't talk childishly.

390
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:04,000
I never go back on my word.

391
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:06,458
Soldiers are brothers, even
if they belong to different countries.

392
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,958
An upright father's
son is also upright. Okay.

393
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,250
Come on. Throw it.

394
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,750
Fine. I believe you.

395
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:24,625
Take out the file.

396
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,875
I also prefer peaceful means.

397
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,667
Have you found it?

398
00:34:12,792 --> 00:34:14,917
Pal, the watch isn't that flashy.

399
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:17,750
Do you want to check
the time or some dance?

400
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:18,792
Come on, throw the file.

401
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:21,000
What:

402
00:34:21,917 --> 00:34:23,125
Throw the file.

403
00:34:25,292 --> 00:34:26,292
What file?

404
00:34:30,792 --> 00:34:32,375
Look, don't turn your back on me.

405
00:34:33,542 --> 00:34:36,042
No, really. Which file?

406
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:40,041
We're brothers. Don't be a rascal.

407
00:34:40,042 --> 00:34:43,042
I've always been
a rascal to you, isn't it?

408
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:44,667
So I have become one for real now.

409
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:46,500
You've showed your true colours.

410
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,042
Give me the file quietly.

411
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,042
Come. The file is at my back side.

412
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:53,167
Come and lick it a little.
You'll get it.

413
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,792
Come on, baby.

414
00:34:54,917 --> 00:34:56,541
Darn you. I curse you.

415
00:34:56,542 --> 00:35:00,667
So be it. I am ready to
get cursed for my motherland.

416
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:02,292
It's no big deal.

417
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:05,500
You can't get away with this.
You rascal.

418
00:35:05,542 --> 00:35:07,417
I will. I will.

419
00:35:07,542 --> 00:35:11,042
I saved you. So anything is possible.

420
00:35:11,167 --> 00:35:12,792
We are really tough.

421
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:15,042
Darn you. I am calling you my brother.

422
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:16,292
Shut up.

423
00:35:16,917 --> 00:35:20,167
Brother, my foot!
He was trying to buy me.

424
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:23,542
Killed me!

425
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:37,375
He wants me dead.

426
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:01,542
Spare me!

427
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:06,417
How was it?

428
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,667
You fake. Darn you.

429
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:12,667
It's just a bruise.

430
00:36:14,042 --> 00:36:15,042
On my arm.

431
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:19,417
I took out the arm on
which you are wearing my watch.

432
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,250
That's why my time isn't good.

433
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:24,541
Your intention is not right.

434
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:27,792
You thug. God sees everything, son.

435
00:36:27,917 --> 00:36:31,042
Minor injuries are a daily thing.

436
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:33,042
I am not budging.

437
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:34,292
Remember that.

438
00:36:34,417 --> 00:36:36,667
Okay, son. Don't move. Good on you.

439
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:40,167
If you move, the poison
will spread in your entire body.

440
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:43,917
Your game will be
over in 15-20 minutes.

441
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:45,167
End of story.

442
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:47,167
If you want to live
for half an hour more then...

443
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:48,542
...come with me to Pakistan.

444
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,417
We're half an hour behind you guys.

445
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:54,417
Tell me something.

446
00:36:54,542 --> 00:36:56,542
How will you cook food?

447
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:00,250
How will you pee?

448
00:37:00,792 --> 00:37:02,917
How will you clean your bum?

449
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,167
Now tell me.
This is how I am going to clean it.

450
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:23,667
""Stories are long.""

451
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:29,542
""Talks are done with bullets.""

452
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:35,542
""Words hurt.""

453
00:37:43,417 --> 00:37:49,292
""The stories are weird.""

454
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:54,042
""The blood is mixed in the mud.""

455
00:37:54,292 --> 00:37:58,792
""The saints lose their lives.""

456
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:24,292
""Crazy men roam in the borders.""

457
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:28,792
""An axe is hit on the legs.""

458
00:38:28,917 --> 00:38:34,292
""The doors are closed.""

459
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:50,250
""There is blood on the borders.""

460
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,542
""There is no account of lives.""

461
00:38:56,167 --> 00:39:00,792
""There is no account of lives.""

462
00:39:00,917 --> 00:39:06,917
""Bits of destiny are found.""

463
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:15,542
""Hit the lines on the head.""

464
00:39:16,542 --> 00:39:21,917
""The lamps at the mosque
are extinguished.""

465
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:28,792
""The lamps at the mosque
are extinguished.""

466
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:36,667
""The terraces have broken
and fallen.""

467
00:40:23,042 --> 00:40:25,417
Why haven't the potatoes
turned sweet yet?

468
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:32,792
This is being discussed in
the whole of Dehradun these days.

469
00:40:34,042 --> 00:40:37,375
The bears ran away. And the potatoes
have turned out to be brilliant.

470
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:41,417
These days people
say so even in Faislabad.

471
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:44,917
This means you'll take
care of the yield there.

472
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:47,500
And I will take care
of the yield here.

473
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:52,750
The climate is the same.

474
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:55,042
Yes, pal.

475
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:59,542
Sukhnal, we've had good rains.

476
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,542
The sun too has been good.

477
00:41:04,042 --> 00:41:08,042
But it rises half
an hour early in India.

478
00:41:11,542 --> 00:41:14,792
Give me the watch. It's my father's.

479
00:41:15,292 --> 00:41:19,042
And you don't want the chain?
Of your wife.

480
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:21,542
Don't you love your wife?

481
00:41:22,417 --> 00:41:25,292
You won't, isn't it? - No.

482
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:31,417
Be happy. I give it to you as charity.

483
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,500
Get lost, ungrateful.
I know how charitable you are.

484
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:40,250
We fed you potatoes.
And you gave us bullets.

485
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:41,541
Weren't you ashamed?

486
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:44,167
As if you spared me.

487
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:47,042
The thick blanket saved me. I swear.

488
00:41:47,542 --> 00:41:53,292
And what about the fact
that you've shot me. In the arm.

489
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:56,250
You almost took out my heart.

490
00:41:57,042 --> 00:42:00,750
Those are the marks
of old Delhi's marbles.

491
00:42:04,042 --> 00:42:06,000
Where did you live in old Delhi?

492
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,417
Chandni Chowk. Matiyamahal.

493
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,417
Where is that?

494
00:42:15,042 --> 00:42:21,042
Follow the aroma of the
'Korma'(Dish) at Jama Masjid.

495
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,542
And you will be there.

496
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:27,750
Don't make me hungry. You rogue.

497
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:31,542
Here at the border,
all you get to eat are bullets.

498
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:33,042
Nothing else.

499
00:42:35,542 --> 00:42:37,875
It's been so many days
we have been starving.

500
00:42:40,542 --> 00:42:44,667
The 'Lassi'(Sweet buttermilk)
of Hal Bazaar, Lahore...

501
00:42:45,292 --> 00:42:47,417
...and the meal to boot.

502
00:42:48,292 --> 00:42:52,417
Have the tempered 'Nihari'(Dish)
and go to sleep.

503
00:42:53,917 --> 00:42:57,292
Sleeping like a log
as if I have done...

504
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:01,292
...all the labour work of Lahore.

505
00:43:01,917 --> 00:43:04,292
Read out the newspaper to the elders.

506
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:07,542
And get a penny as a reward.

507
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:09,917
And then go straight to Lal Kuan.

508
00:43:11,417 --> 00:43:13,167
And buy a kite.

509
00:43:13,667 --> 00:43:17,917
And we used to flirt with women.

510
00:43:19,917 --> 00:43:26,167
I had wooed my wife with my couplets.

511
00:43:27,417 --> 00:43:29,542
Tied it under the
sun in the afternoon.

512
00:43:32,167 --> 00:43:37,250
And tied it to the leg of
the cot and went to sleep at night.

513
00:43:39,042 --> 00:43:42,042
And we would find it
right there in the morning.

514
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:46,750
On the minaret of the Jama Masjid.

515
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:51,875
As if it had been talking
to Allah all night.

516
00:43:54,542 --> 00:44:00,375
Kites looks good
under your own sky, pal.

517
00:44:03,042 --> 00:44:09,667
The moon would rise on the
roof as if it would fall on my cot.

518
00:44:17,292 --> 00:44:20,292
Lahore's moon always snubbed me.

519
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,542
Want to exchange your moon with mine?

520
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:42,375
Where are you settled in Delhi?

521
00:44:43,542 --> 00:44:47,042
Not found yet.
I live in a camp as of now.

522
00:44:49,417 --> 00:44:53,667
The vegetable market
near the ice factory.

523
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:57,500
Ishwardas has onions
buried in the ice factory.

524
00:44:58,792 --> 00:45:01,042
He took Rs. 21 from my father.

525
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:03,500
He said he'll get
him a house in Pakistan.

526
00:45:03,542 --> 00:45:05,167
Be wary.

527
00:45:06,292 --> 00:45:08,292
This has happened to everyone.

528
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,042
My mother had kept 40
kilograms of pickle to dry.

529
00:45:14,417 --> 00:45:16,542
Someone must have eaten it for sure.

530
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,667
Let everyone get a taste of it.

531
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,167
Okay, tell me.

532
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:27,500
Who all are there in your family?

533
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:32,250
Wife, my kid and father.

534
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:34,167
And your mother?

535
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:36,792
You guys had cut her into pieces.

536
00:45:37,542 --> 00:45:39,292
You didn't spare mothers either.

537
00:45:40,042 --> 00:45:43,667
Blood was shed
on both sides, isn't it?

538
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:46,167
A bit more on our side.

539
00:45:47,542 --> 00:45:49,542
This is what everyone feels, pal.

540
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:54,167
I suggest.

541
00:45:55,792 --> 00:45:56,792
Go.

542
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:01,292
Go back home.

543
00:46:03,542 --> 00:46:05,542
Look after your father.

544
00:46:08,292 --> 00:46:10,542
Shower your kid with love.

545
00:46:12,292 --> 00:46:16,292
They need you more than the border.

546
00:46:22,042 --> 00:46:23,542
Show yourself.

547
00:46:27,042 --> 00:46:28,542
Come on.

548
00:47:20,417 --> 00:47:22,917
'Border station. Border station.'

549
00:47:23,042 --> 00:47:24,542
'The enemy has shown
his true colours.'

550
00:47:24,667 --> 00:47:26,167
'Despite the ceasefire. Over.'

551
00:47:26,292 --> 00:47:27,792
'We will be stationed here. Over.'

552
00:47:27,917 --> 00:47:30,042
'The neighbouring
posts have been hit.'

553
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,167
'Many of our soldiers have
been killed. Over and out.'

554
00:47:33,792 --> 00:47:35,417
I saw you.

555
00:47:36,417 --> 00:47:39,000
And your bosses have
shown their true colours.

556
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:42,250
You all are not capable of trust.

557
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,542
Do you know the meaning of ceasefire?

558
00:47:45,917 --> 00:47:49,375
If we hug you, you will stab
a dagger in our back.

559
00:47:50,042 --> 00:47:52,042
You are dogs. Dogs.

560
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:56,917
He is quite an artist. That rogue.

561
00:52:21,792 --> 00:52:23,917
Hey you. Pakistani.

562
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:31,542
You've ran out of bullets. Is it?

563
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:41,292
Is this what the Pakistani
army has taught you?

564
00:52:43,917 --> 00:52:45,875
You forgot the bullets?

565
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:52,167
""My car has taken off.
Where has it stopped?""

566
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,875
Come. Come on, son. Come.

567
00:52:55,542 --> 00:52:57,167
I'll feed you flatbreads.

568
00:52:57,292 --> 00:52:59,917
Later don't complain
that I didn't explain to you.

569
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,417
You scrag.

570
00:53:02,167 --> 00:53:05,417
Hey, Pakistani,
the game has turned upside down.

571
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,417
Come on.

572
00:53:06,542 --> 00:53:07,917
Hey. Hey. Darn you.

573
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:14,375
Pakistani, if you hit us with drums...

574
00:53:14,417 --> 00:53:15,917
...we'll hit you with bullets.

575
00:53:16,042 --> 00:53:18,167
Come on out.

576
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:21,542
We are not cowards.
We are no less than anyone.

577
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:24,792
You are dealing with an Indian.

578
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,625
Brother.

579
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,417
You knew that I was coming
to your place for a feast?

580
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:54,792
Mr. Harban had told
me that he wanted to have...

581
00:53:55,792 --> 00:53:57,292
...flatbreads stuffed with potatoes.

582
00:53:58,167 --> 00:53:59,917
That's why I had prepped up.

583
00:54:01,042 --> 00:54:04,417
It's okay.
Brother has made it for his brother.

584
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,417
And the brother ate them.

585
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:08,667
You can't take one's
food away from him.

586
00:54:08,875 --> 00:54:10,167
By the way, you're quite good.

587
00:54:10,292 --> 00:54:10,917
Thank you.

588
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:13,250
Tell me one thing.

589
00:54:15,167 --> 00:54:16,625
You shot me in the head.

590
00:54:16,792 --> 00:54:18,042
What if I had died?

591
00:54:18,167 --> 00:54:19,375
Yes. Yes. - What?

592
00:54:19,417 --> 00:54:22,792
No. No. I mean I made a mistake.

593
00:54:23,167 --> 00:54:25,875
My wife is pregnant. - Yes. Yes.

594
00:54:29,542 --> 00:54:30,500
Give me some water.

595
00:54:30,792 --> 00:54:31,875
Here's your flatbread.

596
00:54:36,792 --> 00:54:37,792
Give me some water.

597
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:40,625
There is no water.

598
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:45,500
Come on, pick up the bucket.

599
00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:57,167
You rogue. Is this a well or a tunnel?

600
00:54:57,375 --> 00:54:59,375
Pull fast. - Done, brother.

601
00:55:05,125 --> 00:55:05,792
Hey!

602
00:55:07,792 --> 00:55:08,375
Keep it here.

603
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:14,167
Rascal.

604
00:55:14,417 --> 00:55:16,917
I had asked you to draw it.
Not to drink it.

605
00:55:17,042 --> 00:55:18,792
Move. Move.

606
00:55:21,917 --> 00:55:22,917
Darn it.

607
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:39,000
Walk straight.

608
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:43,500
You took all the files, right?

609
00:55:44,167 --> 00:55:45,917
You fool.
I am talking to you. - Yes. Yes.

610
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:49,042
Sir, your watch and chain.
- Will take it later, moron.

611
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:51,750
You are not going anywhere. - Yes.

612
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:53,917
Yes.

613
00:55:54,292 --> 00:55:57,750
I swear. Your 'Yes' is very sweet.
- Thank you.

614
00:56:00,167 --> 00:56:02,875
Sir, God bless you.

615
00:56:03,417 --> 00:56:06,542
I have something to say.
If you don't mind.

616
00:56:06,625 --> 00:56:08,417
Look, I am unpredictable.

617
00:56:09,375 --> 00:56:12,375
But still, let me tell you.

618
00:56:13,417 --> 00:56:16,542
There is no tunnel in India.

619
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:21,417
Pakistan doubts India.

620
00:56:21,792 --> 00:56:24,667
You dork. That's why you are a cook.

621
00:56:25,792 --> 00:56:28,750
This is beyond our comprehension.

622
00:56:29,167 --> 00:56:33,875
Son, this is all about
big officers and politics.

623
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:36,917
Yes. Yes. - Yes. Yes.

624
00:56:40,667 --> 00:56:47,917
Brother, our captain.
I mean he is just about okay.

625
00:56:48,542 --> 00:56:50,167
He is just like you.

626
00:56:50,292 --> 00:56:51,750
Go meet him this 'Diwali'(Festival)
as soon as you go back.

627
00:56:51,792 --> 00:56:52,542
Yes.

628
00:56:53,167 --> 00:56:56,417
No. I mean he seems authoritative.

629
00:56:56,917 --> 00:57:02,500
That's why he roped
in soldiers like you.

630
00:57:03,792 --> 00:57:05,875
Hats off to the Pakistan Army.

631
00:57:05,917 --> 00:57:07,167
And look at ours.

632
00:57:07,542 --> 00:57:10,417
What is the word you say? Dork.

633
00:57:10,792 --> 00:57:13,792
Dork. - Yes. Dorks.

634
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:19,292
They didn't believe.
They didn't believe the cook.

635
00:57:19,792 --> 00:57:21,750
I even informed them that the enemy...

636
00:57:22,292 --> 00:57:23,542
I mean the enemy...

637
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:27,167
I mean we were enemies
when we met last night, isn't it?

638
00:57:27,417 --> 00:57:28,375
We aren't now.

639
00:57:30,375 --> 00:57:34,250
I have decided.
- What the hell have you decided?

640
00:57:34,667 --> 00:57:37,667
I will join the Pakistan
army as soon as I return.

641
00:57:37,792 --> 00:57:39,167
Recommend me.

642
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:41,750
I mean even if we
don't find the file...

643
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:45,875
...I will dig a tunnel
from Lahore to Lal Killa.

644
00:57:45,917 --> 00:57:47,417
I am telling you.

645
00:57:48,167 --> 00:57:50,167
How are you going to dig the tunnel?

646
00:57:50,292 --> 00:57:51,417
Darn you.

647
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,500
Drop your 8""""-

648
00:57:52,542 --> 00:57:54,417
Burfi. - Drop it.

649
00:57:54,667 --> 00:57:57,167
Burfi. Hello, brother.

650
00:57:57,292 --> 00:57:58,625
Drop the gun.

651
00:57:58,792 --> 00:58:03,667
Thank God. You are here.

652
00:58:03,792 --> 00:58:06,667
He... He...

653
00:58:08,125 --> 00:58:09,375
You saved my life.

654
00:58:09,792 --> 00:58:13,542
Darn you. You want stuffed flatbreads,
don't you?

655
00:58:13,792 --> 00:58:15,000
How about this?

656
00:58:16,375 --> 00:58:17,292
And this.

657
00:58:17,667 --> 00:58:18,792
Darn you.

658
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,792
Brother you. - Get up, you rouge.

659
00:58:21,292 --> 00:58:23,042
Get up. Get up.

660
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,042
Fast.

661
00:58:27,125 --> 00:58:29,750
Pick up the bucket. Pick up the rope.

662
00:58:29,792 --> 00:58:31,292
Draw the water. - No, brother.

663
00:58:32,167 --> 00:58:35,042
You shoot me.
You slapped me. - Come on, brother.

664
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:37,167
I am your slave.

665
00:58:37,292 --> 00:58:40,500
You scrag. You thank you are the boss.

666
00:58:40,542 --> 00:58:42,625
You scrag. Darn you.

667
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:45,042
Hey. Stop. Stop.

668
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,875
Burfi, my brother. You saved me.

669
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:52,167
Look. He has given me a swollen cheek.

670
00:58:52,292 --> 00:58:55,042
You Pakistani. He is a postman now.

671
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:59,542
If he had been in the army,
he would ruin your lives.

672
00:58:59,667 --> 00:59:02,042
Tell him. The rascal.

673
00:59:02,792 --> 00:59:03,792
Shut up.

674
00:59:07,167 --> 00:59:09,042
Burfi. What happened, brother?

675
00:59:10,875 --> 00:59:13,917
You were singing praises of Pakistan.

676
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:17,792
No. - Our soldiers are no good.

677
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:19,417
And their soldiers are very good.

678
00:59:19,542 --> 00:59:21,167
No. Wrong. You are wrong.

679
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:23,542
And you took a you turn the
moment you saw me. - No. No.

680
00:59:23,667 --> 00:59:25,375
You were taking our files. - No. No.

681
00:59:25,417 --> 00:59:26,875
You were taking our files to Pakistan.

682
00:59:26,917 --> 00:59:28,791
Brother, I was just pretending.

683
00:59:28,792 --> 00:59:30,042
I swear. I was pretending.

684
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:32,500
Why did you join the army
if you are fond of pretending?

685
00:59:32,542 --> 00:59:33,792
Darn refugee.

686
00:59:33,917 --> 00:59:35,292
Half Pakistani.

687
00:59:35,417 --> 00:59:37,292
Don't say such things.
Don't say such things, mate.

688
00:59:37,375 --> 00:59:41,042
Mate. I am your mate.

689
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:43,875
That Pakistani is your brother.

690
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:46,042
Dear brother.

691
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,791
Girls have mates. Get it.

692
00:59:48,792 --> 00:59:51,125
What rubbish, brother.

693
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:54,500
You are talking trash
in front of the enemy.

694
00:59:54,542 --> 00:59:56,292
What did you do in front of the enemy?

695
00:59:56,542 --> 00:59:57,625
You ruined everything.

696
00:59:57,667 --> 00:59:59,917
I wish you had died. I so wish.

697
01:00:00,542 --> 01:00:02,917
Darn it. You were taking
the files to Pakistan.

698
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:07,000
I swear.
He had a gun pointing at my back.

699
01:00:07,667 --> 01:00:10,792
I would've never entertained
these dogs otherwise.

700
01:00:12,167 --> 01:00:14,875
I am a hapless man.

701
01:00:14,917 --> 01:00:16,292
Who are you? - No.

702
01:00:16,417 --> 01:00:18,250
A two bit cook.

703
01:00:18,292 --> 01:00:19,917
Are you the colonel?
Or the colonel's son?

704
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,792
Get lost.

705
01:00:22,292 --> 01:00:24,042
Hug him.

706
01:00:24,542 --> 01:00:26,167
Come on. Hug him.

707
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:29,417
Hug your brother. The Pakistani.

708
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:31,375
Darn refugee.

709
01:00:31,917 --> 01:00:35,417
Burfi, how do I convince you?

710
01:00:35,917 --> 01:00:39,542
I have fought all night all alone.
All alone.

711
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:44,792
Ask him. Tell him. Tell him.

712
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:49,417
Hey, what are you doing?

713
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:54,667
Sir, I guess the stuffed
flatbreads didn't get digested.

714
01:00:54,792 --> 01:00:55,750
Stuffed flatbreads?

715
01:00:55,792 --> 01:00:57,042
Where did they come from?

716
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,417
Brother made them.

717
01:01:01,042 --> 01:01:02,917
Really.

718
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,125
You rogue. You never felt like
making stuffed flatbreads for us.

719
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:16,417
Brother. Get your sister married.

720
01:01:18,667 --> 01:01:22,042
Brother, if I knew
I would've never told him...

721
01:01:22,167 --> 01:01:24,250
...that you made stuffed flatbreads
for me with so much love.

722
01:01:24,292 --> 01:01:27,000
You will not call me brother.
Let me tell you.

723
01:01:28,542 --> 01:01:33,000
You fed the hungry.
So what should I call you? Sir.

724
01:01:33,042 --> 01:01:36,542
You dog. I am not talking to you.
I am telling you.

725
01:01:37,667 --> 01:01:39,792
Shame on you.

726
01:01:43,792 --> 01:01:48,417
Don't spit, Burfi.
Believe me, brother. For God's sake.

727
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,792
Believe me. For God's sake.

728
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:56,042
You call me Khoya despite swearing
on your mother a million times.

729
01:01:56,125 --> 01:01:57,667
My name is Burfi Singh.

730
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,542
That was a nickname, right?

731
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:00,667
Nickname?

732
01:02:00,792 --> 01:02:03,875
He lies to even his parents.

733
01:02:03,917 --> 01:02:06,042
He has told them that
he is an officer in the army.

734
01:02:06,167 --> 01:02:08,792
He roams all over Delhi as a hero.

735
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,917
He has made me write letters.

736
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,250
Write to mother.

737
01:02:12,292 --> 01:02:15,417
And tell her that I killed
four Pakistanis today.

738
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,292
One day, he said.
Write that I was unarmed...

739
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:22,292
...but I grabbed the Pakistani.

740
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,625
He wants me to believe him.

741
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,292
Hey. Come on.

742
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:33,167
Why the hell are you staring at me?

743
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:34,500
Get up.

744
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:43,375
Why are you grinning?
Why are you grinmng?

745
01:02:43,542 --> 01:02:44,667
Stop behaving like a kid.

746
01:02:44,792 --> 01:02:46,167
You are behaving like a kid.

747
01:02:47,292 --> 01:02:50,375
Have you gone mad?
Have you gone blind?

748
01:02:50,417 --> 01:02:52,000
Can't you see? I have been shot.

749
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,417
I have fought all night all alone.

750
01:02:55,917 --> 01:02:57,875
You kick me. Sometimes you spit at me.

751
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:01,000
Shoot me. End this.

752
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:02,792
You have turned me into a dog.

753
01:03:02,917 --> 01:03:04,542
You have found your pal. Haven't you?

754
01:03:05,042 --> 01:03:06,375
Shame on you.

755
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:08,375
Brother, I was not laughing.

756
01:03:08,542 --> 01:03:10,042
You will not call me brother.

757
01:03:10,167 --> 01:03:11,750
So what's my fault in this?

758
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:13,917
The captain wants the file.
I gave the watch. The chain.

759
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,167
Darn you. You rascal.

760
01:03:17,292 --> 01:03:19,417
Betrayal is in your blood.

761
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:20,750
I will not spare you.

762
01:03:20,792 --> 01:03:25,417
Hey... Hey... You rascal.

763
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,167
You sold our country
for the watch and chain.

764
01:03:29,667 --> 01:03:31,792
You betrayed the country.

765
01:03:34,792 --> 01:03:36,292
My spectacles.

766
01:03:37,917 --> 01:03:38,917
Pal...

767
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:58,042
Hello. Hello.

768
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:16,625
Pass me the screw-driver.
The screw-driver. - Yes, sir.

769
01:04:17,042 --> 01:04:19,750
You dropped the screw-driver.

770
01:04:19,792 --> 01:04:21,667
You're insulting an Indian tool.

771
01:04:21,917 --> 01:04:23,042
Respect it.

772
01:04:23,917 --> 01:04:25,167
Say, ""Forgive me.""

773
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:29,667
Forgive me.
- ""Forgive me, screw-driver.""

774
01:04:31,417 --> 01:04:33,042
Forgive me, screw-driver.

775
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:34,750
Give it.

776
01:04:41,917 --> 01:04:45,125
I will repair it in a second.

777
01:04:47,792 --> 01:04:49,875
Hello. - Hello, head-post 1.

778
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,542
'Border-post 1.' - Border-post 1, sir.

779
01:04:53,125 --> 01:04:55,750
'Is this Burfi Singh,
speaking?' - Yes, sir.

780
01:04:56,042 --> 01:04:57,667
Jai Hind, sir.
Burfi Singh speaking, sir.

781
01:04:57,792 --> 01:05:00,417
'So, Burfi, is everything okay?
- I have been reached here. Yes, sir.

782
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,792
The receiver's been fixed, sir.
I fixed it in a minute.

783
01:05:03,792 --> 01:05:05,417
Sir, I've big news.

784
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:08,167
I've nabbed a Pakistani intruder.

785
01:05:08,792 --> 01:05:10,625
'Pakistani? Are you sure?' - Yes, sir.

786
01:05:11,125 --> 01:05:12,125
He's a Pakistani, sir.

787
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:14,417
We have him, sir.

788
01:05:14,792 --> 01:05:15,792
Don't worry, sir.

789
01:05:16,042 --> 01:05:18,375
Sir, he was stealing the
secret files from the check-post.

790
01:05:18,625 --> 01:05:19,875
We're facing difficulties here, sir.

791
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:25,042
And, sir. I've also caught
a half Pakistani. -'What?'

792
01:05:25,417 --> 01:05:26,750
'Burfi, speak clearly.'

793
01:05:26,917 --> 01:05:29,167
Yes, sir. He's the cook for the unit.

794
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:31,125
We had our suspicion...

795
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:32,792
...that he was working
for the Pakistanis.

796
01:05:33,667 --> 01:05:35,250
After all, he's from that side.

797
01:05:35,667 --> 01:05:36,750
Send the force, sir.

798
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:38,542
And kill them both.

799
01:05:39,542 --> 01:05:41,125
One of them is an intruder...

800
01:05:41,667 --> 01:05:43,000
...while the other one is a traitor.

801
01:05:43,542 --> 01:05:45,250
'Burfi, hold your position.'

802
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:48,667
Yes, sir. -'lt's important
for that Pakistani to stay alive.'

803
01:05:48,792 --> 01:05:50,542
'I'm sending reinforcements.'
- One more thing, sir.

804
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:53,417
Please make me a soldier now.

805
01:05:55,667 --> 01:05:57,542
Together,
I will annihilate all the Pakistanis.

806
01:05:58,042 --> 01:05:59,250
'I will recommend your name, Burfi.'

807
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,792
'Hold your position.' - Yes, sir.
- 'Over and out.'

808
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:01,792
Over and out, sir.

809
01:06:10,917 --> 01:06:15,542
Kumar. Darn post-master.

810
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,167
I won't spare you.

811
01:06:18,417 --> 01:06:19,792
Just watch what I do with you.

812
01:06:23,792 --> 01:06:26,125
And you, you got lucky.

813
01:06:27,292 --> 01:06:32,000
Sir has said he wants
to question the intruder.

814
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:35,042
Sir. - What is it?

815
01:06:35,542 --> 01:06:38,750
Sir, I need to pee.

816
01:06:40,542 --> 01:06:43,000
Come on.

817
01:06:58,042 --> 01:07:03,625
I've a son. A wife. A father.

818
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:07,167
I cannot defame them.

819
01:07:08,292 --> 01:07:10,125
I will have nowhere to go.

820
01:07:11,292 --> 01:07:12,917
You forgot our brotherhood. - Rascal.

821
01:07:13,167 --> 01:07:15,000
Now's the chance.

822
01:07:16,125 --> 01:07:17,792
Let your father find out...

823
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:21,125
...what his great son's
been up to out here.

824
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:24,542
Look, he's running.

825
01:07:57,792 --> 01:07:59,292
Forgive me, sir.

826
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:03,625
Scoundrel.

827
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:05,917
Trying to run away.

828
01:08:06,292 --> 01:08:07,542
You dog.

829
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:09,167
Samarth, water.

830
01:08:11,625 --> 01:08:13,500
Brother, give me some water.

831
01:08:13,542 --> 01:08:14,542
I don't have a bucket.

832
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:16,125
Where is it then?

833
01:08:17,333 --> 01:08:19,125
Ask him who was running away...

834
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:20,125
...where did he throw it.

835
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:26,875
What will an officer
do if he feels thirsty?

836
01:08:28,333 --> 01:08:29,625
Sitting there comfortably.

837
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:32,958
Sit like a rooster.

838
01:08:34,958 --> 01:08:36,875
Sit like a rooster.

839
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:49,958
He's there and he sent
me here to die. - Who?

840
01:08:51,375 --> 01:08:52,458
My captain.

841
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:54,875
Where's your captain?

842
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:56,958
Across the border.

843
01:08:59,708 --> 01:09:02,875
I think they'll dig my
grave before I dig a tunnel.

844
01:09:04,125 --> 01:09:05,958
Sir, I didn't want to come either.

845
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,125
Then why did you?

846
01:09:10,375 --> 01:09:12,333
And why did you try to run?

847
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,125
What were you thinking?

848
01:09:14,958 --> 01:09:17,125
You can escape from Burfi Singh?

849
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:30,750
Mr. Samarth, Are you hatching
your eggs sitting over there?

850
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:35,458
Stand up.

851
01:09:43,458 --> 01:09:45,958
If you dare sit in
front of an officer...

852
01:09:46,208 --> 01:09:49,125
...then you will never
be anything more than a cook.

853
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:02,125
Salute me.

854
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:06,750
Salute.

855
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:11,333
Salute me.

856
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:16,833
Good.

857
01:10:23,375 --> 01:10:25,000
You came here for the file?

858
01:10:25,625 --> 01:10:28,125
Sir, my captain wanted the file.

859
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:31,250
If everything is
needed by your captain...

860
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:34,875
...then have you come here
looking for a groom for your mom?

861
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:38,208
Yes. Yes.

862
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:42,125
A captain's order
is a captain's order.

863
01:10:42,458 --> 01:10:43,583
Has to be carried out.

864
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:45,625
Right?

865
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:48,375
When I become an officer.

866
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:53,375
I am one.

867
01:10:55,458 --> 01:10:58,250
Then you will certainly
follow my order.

868
01:11:08,375 --> 01:11:10,625
Right, Samarth.

869
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:13,625
You will have to follow orders.

870
01:11:14,708 --> 01:11:15,875
What are you staring at?

871
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,625
Don't stare.

872
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:20,875
I would've shot you two.

873
01:11:22,125 --> 01:11:26,750
It's only because I received orders...

874
01:11:27,958 --> 01:11:29,625
...to keep you two alive.

875
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:34,375
That's why I spare your life.
I am sparing your life.

876
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,875
Sir, I will certainly
die under this hot sun.

877
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,125
You think you're that important.

878
01:11:42,333 --> 01:11:44,125
My back's stiffened, sir.

879
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:47,708
Straighten up. Back has stiffened!

880
01:11:57,458 --> 01:11:59,250
I am no less than a dog, sir.

881
01:12:09,833 --> 01:12:12,250
Early in the morning father said
to me that he has to go somewhere.

882
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:15,125
And he did too.

883
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:20,250
But we could never
find out where he went.

884
01:12:22,125 --> 01:12:23,625
So did mother...

885
01:12:26,083 --> 01:12:27,375
...and my sister.

886
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:33,250
But I couldn't find out...

887
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:38,250
...where they all went.

888
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,333
What nonsense is this?

889
01:12:46,875 --> 01:12:50,625
If you knew, Burfi...

890
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,750
...then all this
wouldn't have happened.

891
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:59,250
Someone asked for it, and we obliged.

892
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:04,750
We became dogs. Dogs.

893
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:08,125
From where are we?

894
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,583
We don't even know that.

895
01:13:12,958 --> 01:13:16,708
Its wrong.

896
01:13:18,208 --> 01:13:19,125
Anyway-

897
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:21,875
Forget all this.

898
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,250
Look, Burfi.

899
01:13:25,625 --> 01:13:26,750
How will you understand?

900
01:13:28,708 --> 01:13:34,625
You need a heart
to understand all this.

901
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:37,250
And you don't have one.

902
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,625
Shut up, you traitor.

903
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:41,750
You shouldn't talk about a heart.

904
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:48,000
You shouldn't be hearing it either.

905
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,125
Not at all.

906
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,625
Sir. Sir.

907
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:02,125
What is it?

908
01:14:02,208 --> 01:14:05,500
Sir, you're very intelligent.

909
01:14:07,208 --> 01:14:08,750
I don't want any file.

910
01:14:09,625 --> 01:14:10,750
Let me go.

911
01:14:12,125 --> 01:14:13,875
Who's giving you the file?

912
01:14:14,375 --> 01:14:16,125
Not me, my captain.

913
01:14:16,708 --> 01:14:18,625
Whether it's you or the captain.

914
01:14:18,708 --> 01:14:20,750
You both are Pakistanis.

915
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:25,833
No, sir. I've lived
in Old Delhi for 30 years.

916
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:27,458
I belong here.

917
01:14:28,708 --> 01:14:30,208
I see. - Yes.

918
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:34,583
Come here. - Yes.

919
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:41,083
Where from Old Delhi?

920
01:14:41,625 --> 01:14:42,625
Matiya Mahal.

921
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:44,500
Do you know Majid?

922
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:47,000
The Khamidi bread maker.
- Noor llaiyi's son.

923
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:49,250
Noor llaiyi's son.

924
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:53,125
Rascal.

925
01:14:55,750 --> 01:15:00,125
You stayed here for 30 years.

926
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:02,125
In India.

927
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,333
And then you turned
your faith towards them.

928
01:15:06,625 --> 01:15:07,875
Joined their army.

929
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:10,125
And now you're killing us.

930
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:13,625
You're a dog as well, just like him.

931
01:15:15,625 --> 01:15:17,000
What are you doing?

932
01:15:20,708 --> 01:15:22,125
What's in your bag?

933
01:15:22,875 --> 01:15:25,583
Nothing.

934
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:28,250
What's in your bag?

935
01:15:28,333 --> 01:15:30,375
Put down your bag.

936
01:15:36,458 --> 01:15:37,625
What is it?

937
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:40,833
What else did you give him?

938
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:46,958
What? What is it in his bag?

939
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,125
What is this?

940
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,958
It belongs to my child, sir.

941
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,875
I thought it belongs to your mother.

942
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:30,375
You were saying you don't have water,
bucket, this, that.

943
01:16:48,833 --> 01:16:50,583
Burfi.

944
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:03,083
Look, I don't want any file.

945
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:06,250
Let me go home.

946
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:10,750
Let me go home.

947
01:17:11,208 --> 01:17:12,750
No. Don't let him go.

948
01:17:12,875 --> 01:17:14,124
Hold him for 10-15 minutes.

949
01:17:14,125 --> 01:17:15,833
The reinforcement's on the way.
They will deal with him.

950
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:17,958
I can't see a thing.

951
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,833
Get the medikit. It's in the bag.

952
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:23,875
I will die.

953
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:27,250
Sit down. Have courage.

954
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:29,583
Have courage.
- Do what you want to quickly.

955
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:33,500
Don't lose hope. Don't lose hope.

956
01:17:34,125 --> 01:17:37,333
Don't tell my father. - Just a minute.

957
01:17:37,375 --> 01:17:38,875
Your father has sent a letter.
- Don't tell my father.

958
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,375
Really. Your father has sent a letter.

959
01:17:40,458 --> 01:17:41,875
Just a minute.

960
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,375
Wait. Wait. - Everyone
will call my son a traitor.

961
01:17:47,458 --> 01:17:49,125
Son of traitor.

962
01:17:52,458 --> 01:17:53,958
Just a minute.
- Everyone will call my son a traitor

963
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,583
Listen. Listen.

964
01:17:56,750 --> 01:18:04,500
Father says ""Bless you.
May God bless you with happiness.""

965
01:18:05,083 --> 01:18:11,708
""We're doing okay,
we manage to sell 20-25 bags a day.""

966
01:18:12,625 --> 01:18:15,250
""The paperwork has been completed.""

967
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:20,500
""Room no 1056 in Old Delhi,
Chandni Chowk...""

968
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:26,625
""...near the Town Hall,
we got back our home.""

969
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,375
""We got back our home.""

970
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:33,625
""You... you come back home soon.""

971
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:37,625
""Son, now leave the army...""

972
01:18:37,833 --> 01:18:39,875
""...and spend the rest
of your life with us.""

973
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,833
""God bless you with happiness.""

974
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,875
""We should respect the Lord as well.""

975
01:18:47,333 --> 01:18:49,125
""We've received news from Lahore...""

976
01:18:49,833 --> 01:18:52,708
""...Uncle Afzal passed away.""

977
01:18:54,958 --> 01:18:56,708
'You know Afzal Qureshi?'

978
01:18:57,125 --> 01:18:58,875
'At least say uncle Afzal.'

979
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,250
'His son Rizwan and
I were childhood friends.'

980
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:10,375
""Tomorrow if you face Rizwan,
you won't be able to shoot him.""

981
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:15,375
""This is not our job to do.""

982
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:19,500
""We've kin on that side, and this.""

983
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:22,125
Sister-in-law has written...

984
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:25,333
hope you're keeping good health.""

985
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:27,750
""Everything is fine here.""

986
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:32,000
""Mother's not been keeping well.""

987
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,000
""We took her to the physician.""

988
01:19:35,708 --> 01:19:39,125
""Billa is mischievous all the time.""

989
01:19:40,083 --> 01:19:41,875
""He has also learnt to abuse.""

990
01:19:43,125 --> 01:19:45,250
""Come and slap him.""

991
01:19:46,958 --> 01:19:48,750
""Come and celebrate 'Diwali' with us.""

992
01:19:50,125 --> 01:19:53,833
""Billa's birthday's arriving as well.
Bring something for him.""

993
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:58,125
""Don't go back again."".

994
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:05,500
""My mind keeps racing,
and the heart's always restless.""

995
01:20:06,375 --> 01:20:07,875
""Lajwanti

996
01:20:18,625 --> 01:20:21,208
'I felt like this letter has been
sent from my home.'

997
01:20:25,958 --> 01:20:27,208
Water.

998
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:33,125
Burfi, go get water.

999
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:37,125
Or, he'll die.

1000
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:04,625
Look after him.

1001
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:56,833
What is the name of your child?

1002
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:00,625
Riyaz?

1003
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:05,583
How old is he?

1004
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:11,208
He'll turn four this year.

1005
01:22:15,083 --> 01:22:16,333
And your son?

1006
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:18,958
11 years.

1007
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:24,875
He studies...

1008
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,750
...in the fifth standard.

1009
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:39,833
You didn't tell me your name?

1010
01:22:41,583 --> 01:22:42,625
Rehmat Ali.

1011
01:22:50,833 --> 01:22:54,208
Go back to your home.

1012
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Don't come back here.

1013
01:23:06,625 --> 01:23:09,000
You go home too. - Yes.

1014
01:23:10,125 --> 01:23:14,125
If... I survive...

1015
01:23:18,083 --> 01:23:19,208
Brother.

1016
01:23:20,125 --> 01:23:21,250
Brother.

1017
01:23:22,625 --> 01:23:23,708
Brother.

1018
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:26,333
Brother.

1019
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,125
Brother.

1020
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:31,250
Brother.

1021
01:23:35,125 --> 01:23:36,625
Samarth.

1022
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
He's dead.

1023
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:55,500
Get me water.

1024
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:58,750
There's no water, sir.

1025
01:25:04,125 --> 01:25:05,875
You've been here all night.

1026
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:08,250
And what did you do?

1027
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,083
You couldn't find a file.

1028
01:25:10,708 --> 01:25:12,750
There it is, sir. The file.

1029
01:25:27,833 --> 01:25:29,250
All these files are a waste.

1030
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:31,250
Where is the file with the tunnel map?

1031
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,958
Where's that file of the tunnel?
- It must be in there, sir.

1032
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:01,000
Hey, come here!

1033
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:23,500
Sir, can I make a request.

1034
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:27,375
Pakistan doubts India.

1035
01:26:28,625 --> 01:26:30,208
There's no tunnel.

1036
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:31,458
Nor any file, maybe.

1037
01:26:32,208 --> 01:26:34,625
According to me.

1038
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,083
What nonsense is this? - No.

1039
01:26:39,208 --> 01:26:40,958
All my soldiers are dead.

1040
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:43,583
And you say there's no file.

1041
01:26:43,875 --> 01:26:47,375
Sir, the officers can make a mistake.

1042
01:26:48,625 --> 01:26:53,250
What do you mean?
- I mean the information can be wrong.

1043
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:00,250
I mean such an important
file in this small check-post, how?

1044
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:02,875
I mean...

1045
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,625
These officers...

1046
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,250
These scoundrels
have made our life hell.

1047
01:27:23,125 --> 01:27:24,750
Yes, yes.

1048
01:27:26,125 --> 01:27:28,083
Exactly, sir.

1049
01:27:30,875 --> 01:27:32,958
They didn't even
let me celebrate 'Eid'.

1050
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,500
It's all politics, sir.

1051
01:27:36,708 --> 01:27:38,208
Selfish scoundrels.

1052
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,375
They sit comfortably
at home while we die out here.

1053
01:27:46,375 --> 01:27:48,750
Father wasn't well when I was leaving.

1054
01:27:49,833 --> 01:27:52,625
Wonder... - It'll be fine, sir.

1055
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:55,708
Everything will be fine.

1056
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Yes.

1057
01:27:59,875 --> 01:28:03,000
Both the nations were
talking about peace.

1058
01:28:05,375 --> 01:28:07,458
I thought we'll have
a few days of peace.

1059
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:09,000
Some holidays.

1060
01:28:09,458 --> 01:28:10,708
Yes.

1061
01:28:12,208 --> 01:28:14,000
But this border.

1062
01:28:16,583 --> 01:28:18,750
There would've been a file,
if there wasn't a border.

1063
01:28:19,625 --> 01:28:22,083
I put myself in line
of fire for nothing.

1064
01:28:27,083 --> 01:28:28,500
Why isn't there water here?

1065
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:38,333
Rehmat...

1066
01:28:39,458 --> 01:28:41,458
Sir, he's alive.

1067
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,333
Reh mat.

1068
01:28:48,875 --> 01:28:49,833
Brother.

1069
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:53,000
Brother.

1070
01:28:53,125 --> 01:28:54,208
Traitor...

1071
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:55,958
Siding with the enemy?

1072
01:28:57,833 --> 01:29:00,000
You turned out to be their supporter.

1073
01:29:00,125 --> 01:29:02,000
Traitor.

1074
01:29:03,958 --> 01:29:06,750
Finally you turned out
to be on their side.

1075
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:12,125
Traitor...
officers can make mistakes...?

1076
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:17,250
You'll betray my country?

1077
01:29:28,875 --> 01:29:30,625
Where is the file?

1078
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Where is the file?

1079
01:29:33,333 --> 01:29:35,958
Answer me.

1080
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,958
I'm asking you something!

1081
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:41,000
You won't tell like this...

1082
01:29:42,333 --> 01:29:44,375
Speak.

1083
01:30:15,458 --> 01:30:20,250
""You're not what you seem to be.""

1084
01:30:23,125 --> 01:30:26,875
""You don't look, like what you are.""

1085
01:30:30,375 --> 01:30:41,458
""You say, it's all a lie.
You're not what you seem to be.""

1086
01:30:43,875 --> 01:30:47,750
""You hurt us.""

1087
01:30:47,833 --> 01:30:52,125
""And also heal them.""

1088
01:30:55,375 --> 01:31:00,583
""Ask me, not yourself.""

1089
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:06,458
""You do what you aren't supposed to.""

1090
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:13,000
""You're a liar.""

1091
01:31:14,083 --> 01:31:17,125
""You're a liar.""

1092
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,625
Who shot him?

1093
01:32:33,458 --> 01:32:39,500
""Stories are long.""

1094
01:32:40,625 --> 01:32:44,875
""Talks are done with bullets.""

1095
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:51,500
""Words hurt.""

1096
01:32:56,708 --> 01:33:02,333
""Stories are long.""

1097
01:33:02,833 --> 01:33:07,000
""Talks are done with bullets.""

1098
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:12,750
""Words hurt.""

1099
01:33:20,708 --> 01:33:26,625
""The stories are weird.""

1100
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:31,375
""The blood is mixed in the mud.""

1101
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:36,833
""The saints lose their lives.""

1102
01:33:55,500 --> 01:34:02,000
""Crazy men roam in the borders.""

1103
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:09,208
""Crazy men roam in the borders.""

1104
01:34:09,625 --> 01:34:13,875
""An axe is hit on the legs.""

1105
01:34:14,833 --> 01:34:19,250
""An axe is hit on the legs.""

1106
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:24,500
""The doors are closed.""

1107
01:34:35,375 --> 01:34:40,833
""There is blood on the borders.""

1108
01:34:41,458 --> 01:34:46,208
""There is no account of lives.""

1109
01:34:46,833 --> 01:34:51,250
""There is no account of lives.""

1110
01:34:51,375 --> 01:34:57,250
""Bits of destiny are found.""

1111
01:34:59,708 --> 01:35:07,208
""Hit the lines on the head.""

1112
01:35:12,208 --> 01:35:18,083
""Destiny is written on the borders.""

1113
01:35:18,625 --> 01:35:23,500
""There is no account of lives.""

1114
01:35:23,708 --> 01:35:30,125
""Bits of destiny are found.""

1115
01:35:31,375 --> 01:35:35,875
""Stories are long.""

""Stories are long.""

1118
01:35:47,375 --> 01:35:51,875
""Stories are long.""

""Hit the lines on the head.""

1120
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:05,875
""The lamps at the mosque
are extinguished.""

1121
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:12,500
""The lamps at the mosque
are extinguished.""

1122
01:36:13,833 --> 01:36:20,750
""The terraces have broken and fallen.""

1123
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:31,875
""Stories are long.""

1124
01:36:33,625 --> 01:36:37,500

Mogambo.. is pleased.

00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,964
Daaga. Teja.

3
00:01:33,068 --> 00:01:38,028
Use this money to spread
terror and devastation.

4
00:01:38,407 --> 00:01:44,642
If terrorism,
devastation, destruction, riots..

5
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:52,776
..continue occurring
in India, then soon..

6
00:02:07,636 --> 00:02:09,331
Next time, do your
homework on time!

''One, two, three.. four,
five, six..''

''One, two, three.. four,
five, six..''

10
00:02:43,405 --> 00:02:45,396
If you love movies so much..

11
00:02:45,474 --> 00:02:46,566
.. then learn this.

12
00:02:47,309 --> 00:02:48,708
The Business of movies.

13
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:49,969
Once you learn this..

14
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:53,412
.. you can watch
them and screen them.

15
00:03:00,856 --> 00:03:03,256
One day I'm going to be an actress.

16
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,785
And my movies will be
shown in your theatre.

17
00:03:14,002 --> 00:03:16,732
Look! Someone got
your first autograph.

18
00:04:17,832 --> 00:04:21,928
I'm drunk.. I'm hung-over..

19
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:28,772
With love.. waiting.

20
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:35,879
How should I be, o' restless heart?

21
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:40,785
My restless heart, please tell me.

22
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:48,692
I'm drunk.. I'm hung-over.

23
00:05:01,309 --> 00:05:03,869
How could I have known?
You simply disappeared.

24
00:05:05,447 --> 00:05:06,709
I changed my house.

25
00:05:07,248 --> 00:05:08,715
Did you change your
relationships too?

26
00:05:10,952 --> 00:05:14,718
You weren't around
when I needed a friend.

27
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:21,286
You didn't get married again?

28
00:05:22,263 --> 00:05:24,857
I couldn't find you. Or
I would've married you.

00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:27,461
Rahul. - Anjali.

30
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:31,471
We live once, die once..

31
00:05:31,973 --> 00:05:33,634
..even marry once.

32
00:05:34,476 --> 00:05:36,774
And we fall in love..
- just once.

33
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,390
Congratulations Kamal!

34
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,860
Your daughter's getting married.
- Thank you.

35
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,768
Quiet.

36
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:11,278
Stop this nonsense.

37
00:06:11,446 --> 00:06:14,415
She isn't dead.
She's getting married.

38
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:19,615
''Tandoori Nights''. Play that one.

39
00:06:29,731 --> 00:06:32,325
Why haven't you put the
flowers in Abhays room.

40
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:33,834
Come on, do it fast.

41
00:06:44,913 --> 00:06:46,278
Aaliya!

42
00:06:47,682 --> 00:06:49,673
I know you hate sentimental stuff.

43
00:06:51,386 --> 00:06:52,478
Too bad.

44
00:06:54,422 --> 00:06:55,582
Here goes..

45
00:06:57,058 --> 00:06:58,650
Grandma gave me this ring..

46
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:02,287
For her daughter-in-law..

47
00:07:03,498 --> 00:07:04,726
For you!

48
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:08,301
What a crappy dialogue, Gulati!

49
00:07:08,436 --> 00:07:10,267
'Grandma's ring'? You serious?

50
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:14,900
Aaliya, grandma and grandpa eloped..

51
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:18,977
.. Even though no one had a
problem with their relationship.

52
00:07:20,248 --> 00:07:21,909
The history of this
ring is very dramatic.

53
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:27,283
Al.. I love you.

54
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:29,716
So? Does that mean
we should get married?

55
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,017
Why are love and
marriage the same thing?

56
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:35,023
I mean, here's a
perfectly nice thing. Love.

57
00:07:35,363 --> 00:07:37,490
Now let's destroy it..
Piece by piece.

58
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:39,430
Because if we don't get married..

59
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,866
.. what will PEOPLE say?

60
00:07:41,302 --> 00:07:45,762
Al, you think I wanna marry
you 'cos of social pressure?

61
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,608
I want to get married for us.

62
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,309
For you and me.

63
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:52,872
I know what's gotten into you.

64
00:07:52,947 --> 00:07:56,405
Your sister's wedding trumpets
have crawled under your skin.

65
00:07:56,918 --> 00:07:58,852
Sorry, that can't convince me.

66
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,480
How about this?

67
00:08:00,822 --> 00:08:03,586
I love how my mornings
begin with your voice.

68
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:05,622
'Cos you call for
something important like..

69
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,484
.. ''How do I
switch on the computer?''

70
00:08:08,663 --> 00:08:11,723
And I love how passionately
you do all four of your jobs.

71
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,427
How you come to see me for an hour..

72
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:14,968
.. after tormenting me for fifteen..

73
00:08:15,403 --> 00:08:18,702
.. just to say ''Gulati,
you're an idiot. Now kiss me.''

74
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,733
And I love the way
you shut your eyes..

75
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:28,579
.. and enjoy every
single bite.. from my plate.

76
00:08:30,318 --> 00:08:32,309
And when my clothes smell of you.

77
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:35,445
Your hands on mine..
- Shut up, you idiot.

78
00:08:35,924 --> 00:08:37,551
Let's elope right now.

79
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:42,357
And now we would've kissed.

80
00:08:44,032 --> 00:08:45,294
But that would be weird..

81
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:46,799
.. 'cos I'd be kissing myself.

82
00:08:47,969 --> 00:08:49,903
But, God, I am good.

83
00:09:42,724 --> 00:09:43,816
Drag?

84
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:48,261
No! Smoking is bad for girls

85
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:50,854
Really? I thought
it's bad for anyone.

86
00:09:51,566 --> 00:09:54,535
Men don't get pregnant.
- You're pregnant?

87
00:09:54,969 --> 00:10:00,532
No. But.. I plan to.

88
00:10:01,342 --> 00:10:02,832
Marriage at twenty two.

89
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,535
First kid at twenty three.

90
00:10:04,612 --> 00:10:06,978
Second kid, three years later.

91
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:10,274
My plan was simpler.

92
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,510
Turn twenty and lose my virginity!

93
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,545
Thanks for tomorrow's headlines.

94
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,423
It's a wedding, Al.

95
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,050
Please take your 'chimney' away.

96
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,386
So your wedding smoke is
'devotion'.. And mine is pollution?

97
00:10:21,462 --> 00:10:22,861
Hypocrite!
- Come on, Al.

98
00:10:22,931 --> 00:10:25,661
And spare me your lecture
the cigar is for my play.

99
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:26,961
I have to look convincing!

100
00:10:27,035 --> 00:10:29,026
But why are you
rehearsing when you are a smoker?

101
00:10:30,471 --> 00:10:33,565
Hang on! A play?
- Street play.

102
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:36,076
Which means aunty Ayesha
definitely doesn't know about it.

103
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,504
Nope, 'cos she'll freak out..

104
00:10:37,545 --> 00:10:39,035
.. the minute she
hears the word 'acting'.

105
00:10:39,314 --> 00:10:40,941
It's just one show.
At Pragati Maidan.

106
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,607
No one will ever know.

107
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,049
But you do.

108
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:45,843
Just tell aunty and end the lies.

109
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,444
Stop compromising.

110
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:50,047
The amount you act in real life..
- Less than you.

111
00:10:50,425 --> 00:10:51,949
'Born in his Papa's theatre..

112
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,722
.. and numbed to
death by it's boredom.'

113
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:57,956
Thanks for your
wisdom and sensitivity.

114
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,363
Screw sensitivity!

115
00:10:59,434 --> 00:11:01,800
Uncle Jeet's theatre
business will be fine without you.

116
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:05,361
This is the Nth time.
- What?

117
00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:07,741
Whenever I point out your problem..

118
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:10,710
.. you turn the spotlight on me.

119
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:12,405
But you started.. - But..

120
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,947
Since you won't
focus on your problem..

121
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:17,712
.. without discussing mine,
let's focus on me.

122
00:11:18,686 --> 00:11:22,554
Let's say I tell dad I'm not
interested in his business.

123
00:11:23,424 --> 00:11:27,019
Let's say he doesn't get multiple
cardiac arrests from this news.

124
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:29,793
What will I do then?
- That's the best part.

125
00:11:29,998 --> 00:11:31,761
You'll find out, Gulati.

126
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:35,628
Let's travel. Let's be nomads.

127
00:11:36,004 --> 00:11:38,564
Is this honeymoon ever
going to end? - Aunt Pammi.

128
00:11:38,873 --> 00:11:40,340
When are you getting married?

129
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,636
We're thinking about it.
- Not thought about it.

130
00:11:44,545 --> 00:11:46,809
Tell your babe that if
she continues like this..

131
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:48,610
..she'll stay single
like me. - Don't beat her.

132
00:11:48,683 --> 00:11:51,584
If you're so desperate,
why don't you marry? - Rude!

133
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:54,379
I'm ahead of you by three divorces.

134
00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:56,714
Can't help a quirky destiny.

135
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,759
Destiny is never quirky.
People are.

136
00:11:58,826 --> 00:12:01,488
But aren't quirky
people the most fun?

137
00:12:02,897 --> 00:12:05,991
Cigarette packets come
with a warning, people don't.

138
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,296
Doesn't stop you
from smoking, does it?

139
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:09,394
Wow.

140
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,462
So put your money where your
mouth is the altar's ready.

141
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,837
Get married.

142
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:15,942
Look, Ayesha is here as well.

143
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:19,013
Your mother still looks stunning.

144
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,508
See how she still affects people.

145
00:12:23,518 --> 00:12:26,009
Here comes the superstar!

146
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,519
Still thinks she's a superstar.

147
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,424
See how their tails start wagging.

148
00:12:33,828 --> 00:12:36,023
She still looks a million bucks.

149
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,026
Hi, Aunty.
- Hi, dear.

150
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:40,464
I love your sari.

151
00:12:40,535 --> 00:12:41,866
But where is Aaliya?

152
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,999
Must be up to her
usual tricks somewhere.

153
00:12:45,573 --> 00:12:46,801
Oh no!

154
00:12:53,714 --> 00:12:55,841
What's the rush?
- Can't you smell it?

155
00:12:56,017 --> 00:12:58,850
This henna smells so bad
it's affecting my brains.

156
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,454
Girls look happy with
henna on their hands..

157
00:13:01,522 --> 00:13:02,750
.. 'cos they're
actually high on this dung.

158
00:13:05,293 --> 00:13:08,820
Yonks ago if a lassie had not
this shite in her fair hands..

159
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,725
.. a laddie could carry her away.

160
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:15,759
Henna marked a woman betrothed.

161
00:13:17,905 --> 00:13:19,304
What say thee?

162
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,301
Shall I abduct ye?

163
00:13:21,642 --> 00:13:23,041
Who's stopping you?

164
00:13:23,811 --> 00:13:25,369
Or will ye need steroids?

165
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,723
You've got competition.

166
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:47,500
The maiden is mine.

167
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:49,866
Lower ye eyes.

168
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:51,769
She's your sister.

169
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:54,302
Sis left.

170
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,420
They could've done a court-marriage.

171
00:14:07,488 --> 00:14:09,388
Why are weddings such a circus?

172
00:14:09,824 --> 00:14:11,553
Dumped another thing on her.

173
00:14:11,626 --> 00:14:12,957
She looks like a clothes shop.

174
00:14:13,027 --> 00:14:14,358
She's smiling.

175
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:16,591
''She's smiling.''

176
00:14:16,664 --> 00:14:18,564
Some coma patients
also smile, stupid..

177
00:14:18,633 --> 00:14:19,964
.. doesn't mean they're happy.

178
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:23,767
She's smiling 'cos no one
knows Jai is holding her hands.

179
00:14:26,641 --> 00:14:28,871
They are celebrating the
biggest day of their lives..

180
00:14:29,043 --> 00:14:31,637
..with the most
important people in their lives.

181
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,813
I can't see anyone important here.

182
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:35,371
I'm here for the free food.

183
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:37,314
The men are here
for the free whiskey.

184
00:14:37,385 --> 00:14:39,353
And the women are
missing their TV serials.

185
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:40,948
Stupid.

186
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:44,317
There won't be a repeat
telecast of my sister's wedding.

187
00:14:44,692 --> 00:14:47,889
And happiness grows
only when you share it.

188
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,590
Say that dialogue again.

189
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:57,299
Happiness grows only
when you share it.

190
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:18,651
Like a wild river..

191
00:15:18,993 --> 00:15:24,260
.. she ripples without a care.

192
00:15:24,865 --> 00:15:27,663
Like a gentle stream ..

193
00:15:27,735 --> 00:15:33,537
.. he lets his silences sing.

194
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:38,840
Her fiery sands sting his feet..

195
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,410
.. like sunshine tickles rainy days.

196
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:47,777
You, my dear, are lost without me..

197
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:51,018
.. and I'm incomplete without you.

198
00:15:53,628 --> 00:15:56,654
You, my dear, are lost without me..

199
00:15:56,731 --> 00:15:59,723
.. and I'm incomplete without you.

200
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:08,736
'I love you, Gelato.'
- Hello, 'baby'.

201
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:10,436
Another fight?

202
00:16:10,478 --> 00:16:11,570
Another slap?

203
00:16:11,646 --> 00:16:14,547
'Sorry, baby.'
- 'Kiss me, baby'.

204
00:16:14,615 --> 00:16:17,675
'Sorry, baby! Kiss me, baby!'

205
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:19,276
Buzz off!

206
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:24,013
Bye.

207
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:26,555
There are many ways to die, Al.

208
00:16:26,827 --> 00:16:29,591
Then let's try this.
We'll die together.

209
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:38,933
She melts clouds in her hands..

210
00:16:40,975 --> 00:16:49,405
.. and fills still
nights with laughter.

211
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,310
She melts clouds in her hands..

212
00:16:54,455 --> 00:16:58,516
.. and fills still
nights with laughter.

213
00:16:58,592 --> 00:17:03,291
So fearless, carefree
and thirsty for life..

214
00:17:03,364 --> 00:17:07,858
.. I'm helpless
with her and without.

215
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:10,233
Are you a character from Saas-Bahu
(a popular genre on TV) serials?

216
00:17:10,504 --> 00:17:13,530
It's sign of respect Al..
that comes from the heart.

217
00:17:13,607 --> 00:17:15,802
Then I should take the
blessings of any elder.

218
00:17:15,876 --> 00:17:17,571
Hello, Uncle.
- Bless you.

219
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:19,772
I hope you two get married soon.

220
00:17:20,514 --> 00:17:21,981
Happy Diwali, sir!

221
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,376
So don't do it. It's
not an obligation.

222
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,554
I do it 'cos it makes ma and
papa happy. And that makes me happy.

223
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,485
If it made someone happy,
wouldn't you.. - Suffer spondylitis?

224
00:17:30,524 --> 00:17:31,718
No way!

225
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:33,419
What's wrong with your family?

226
00:17:33,461 --> 00:17:34,519
One cigarette, please.

227
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,792
I'm sorry we're so normal.
And not as 'cool' as you!

228
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:40,994
Perhaps we should all start
smoking 'cos that's so 'rebellious'.

229
00:17:41,335 --> 00:17:42,461
That's it.

230
00:17:42,536 --> 00:17:44,299
Al..
- Screw you, Gulati.

231
00:17:44,805 --> 00:17:46,295
Superb idea!

232
00:17:52,947 --> 00:18:01,651
He opens vials of
perfumes in her heart..

233
00:18:02,356 --> 00:18:06,292
''I've searched for
love high and low.''.

234
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,592
.. and looks for
love-filled shells on sandy shores

235
00:18:11,265 --> 00:18:15,565
He opens vials of
perfumes in her heart..

236
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,729
''I've searched for
love high and low.''.

237
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,932
.. and looks for
love-filled shells on sandy shores

238
00:18:20,007 --> 00:18:24,341
He fills his world with love..

239
00:18:24,512 --> 00:18:26,707
''The closeness of hearts,
the streams of desires.''

240
00:18:26,781 --> 00:18:28,908
.. as she fills hers with dreams.

241
00:18:29,383 --> 00:18:30,873
He was not flirting with me.

242
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:32,475
Yes, he was.

243
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:34,453
Trust me, I am a guy.
- You're jealous.

244
00:18:34,522 --> 00:18:35,921
You're blind.
- What?

245
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,587
Can't a boy and a girl..

246
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:41,294
A boy and a girl can't
be 'just good friends'.

247
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,893
So if we break-up
we can't be friends.

248
00:18:47,968 --> 00:18:49,629
Nope.

249
00:18:51,605 --> 00:18:53,630
God, you're such an old-fashioned..

250
00:18:53,707 --> 00:18:55,368
.. almost chauvinistic..
- You're an idiot.

251
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,708
I can't believe I am with you.

252
00:18:57,778 --> 00:18:58,870
I am sexy.

253
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,980
You, my dear, are lost without me..

254
00:19:09,223 --> 00:19:12,420
.. and I'm incomplete without you.

255
00:19:12,893 --> 00:19:15,726
Like a wild river..

256
00:19:15,896 --> 00:19:20,924
.. she ripples without a care.

257
00:19:21,802 --> 00:19:24,532
Like a gentle stream ..

258
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:30,300
.. he lets his silences sing.

259
00:19:31,612 --> 00:19:35,514
Her fiery sands sting his feet..

260
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:39,477
.. like sunshine tickles rainy days.

261
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:44,581
You, my dear, are lost without me..

262
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:47,718
.. like I'm incomplete without you.

263
00:19:50,498 --> 00:19:53,524
You, my dear, are lost without me..

264
00:19:53,601 --> 00:19:56,764
.. like I'm incomplete without you.

265
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,432
You, my dear, are lost without me..

266
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,968
.. like I'm incomplete without you.

267
00:20:07,381 --> 00:20:09,576
I am Shah Rukh Khan.

268
00:20:13,854 --> 00:20:19,292
This is probably the most disturbing
thing you ever said to me.

269
00:20:20,694 --> 00:20:25,290
I am a star in
every scene of my life.

270
00:20:26,634 --> 00:20:27,896
Okay.

271
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,009
What if you fail to
become an actor?

272
00:20:36,911 --> 00:20:38,310
Lying to your mother..

273
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:41,542
Everything's going
to change Gelati.

274
00:20:42,683 --> 00:20:43,877
Gulato?

275
00:20:44,385 --> 00:20:46,353
What's your name?
- Sunita.

276
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,085
Sunita!

277
00:20:49,056 --> 00:20:51,524
I have a sexy plan, Sunita.

278
00:20:52,326 --> 00:20:55,659
But I'll tell you later 'cos I
don't want to lose the high.

279
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,354
Oh God! Another plan!

280
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,699
Sunita, you're so cute..
- What?

281
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,729
Stress makes you look cuter.

282
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,037
'Oh God! Another plan!'

283
00:21:09,543 --> 00:21:12,444
I'm okay.

284
00:21:14,615 --> 00:21:17,049
You're my stud, Sunita.

285
00:21:17,551 --> 00:21:19,485
You can handle anything.

286
00:21:20,554 --> 00:21:21,953
And you take advantage of that.

287
00:21:22,356 --> 00:21:23,789
Don't say that.

288
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:26,018
You know I'm 'nonsense person'.

289
00:21:26,927 --> 00:21:30,328
Understand, Sunita.
- Why?

290
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:34,523
Why should I understand?

291
00:21:34,735 --> 00:21:36,635
Who argues?
- Me.

292
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,399
Who is stupid?
- Me.

293
00:21:38,472 --> 00:21:41,737
Who is impulsive?
- Me, Your Honour, me.

294
00:21:42,743 --> 00:21:44,438
Then why should I understand?

295
00:21:44,645 --> 00:21:46,613
Who is older? You!

296
00:21:46,947 --> 00:21:49,006
Who is mature? You!

297
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,543
Who is understanding? You!

298
00:21:51,952 --> 00:21:54,318
Who is sensible? You.

299
00:21:54,788 --> 00:21:56,619
So it's all up to you, Sunita.

300
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,089
You've to handle everything.

301
00:21:58,325 --> 00:21:59,622
Because if you let go..

302
00:22:01,996 --> 00:22:03,623
You complete me.

303
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:06,398
Shah Rukh, please!

304
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:10,369
I am the kite and you're my bread.
- Thread.

305
00:22:10,437 --> 00:22:13,372
I fly and you let me go higher..

306
00:22:13,641 --> 00:22:15,700
But as soon as you sense danger..

307
00:22:15,976 --> 00:22:18,001
.. you pull me back.

308
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,974
What if the thread breaks?

309
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,605
Don't say that.

310
00:22:21,682 --> 00:22:24,515
Ask the Thread Maintenance
Department to look after it.

311
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,452
It can't break, it can't break.
- I'll talk to them.

312
00:22:27,688 --> 00:22:31,681
Promise?
- I promise.

313
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:36,385
'Cos I love flying a lot..

314
00:22:36,797 --> 00:22:38,287
I can't help it. - I've noticed.

315
00:22:38,632 --> 00:22:40,361
You know, I'm a USA.

316
00:22:40,934 --> 00:22:44,461
UFO. - I know. Same thing.

317
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,067
So you'll stick around, right?

318
00:22:48,642 --> 00:22:50,075
You won't let us drift apart.

319
00:22:50,844 --> 00:22:52,072
Say it.. !

320
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,646
Sunita, where are you taking me?
- To bed.

321
00:23:22,643 --> 00:23:24,042
I will never let us break.

322
00:23:27,414 --> 00:23:28,574
I promise.

323
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:51,359
Hello. - Ayesha has started
her classic emotional blackmail.

324
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:52,496
So much melodrama..

325
00:23:52,573 --> 00:23:54,404
It was a long shot. !
Didn't think I'd get in.

326
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:55,965
Al, calm down

327
00:23:56,043 --> 00:23:57,340
She's so unreasonable.

328
00:23:57,377 --> 00:23:59,777
She's been gone into
sentimental Overdrive.

329
00:23:59,847 --> 00:24:01,610
Al, are you nuts? This is an office.

330
00:24:01,682 --> 00:24:03,741
If she wasn't my mother,
I would've left home.

331
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,444
Shut up!

332
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,580
This is an office. People work here!

333
00:24:09,623 --> 00:24:10,988
It's a loo actually.

334
00:24:12,426 --> 00:24:13,518
What happened?

335
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,963
Good news, I've got admission here.

336
00:24:17,364 --> 00:24:19,832
Bad news, Ayesha has flatly
refused my going to Gold Coast.

337
00:24:20,267 --> 00:24:21,894
Just a sec! You're
going to Australia?

338
00:24:21,969 --> 00:24:25,336
Obviously not. I want to,
but Ayesha won't let me go.

339
00:24:25,405 --> 00:24:26,565
When did you apply?

340
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,937
Three months ago.

341
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:30,766
It was a long shot.
Didn't think I'd get in.

342
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,574
Thought I'd tell you both
about it.. - From the airport?

343
00:24:34,314 --> 00:24:36,908
Abhay, I am already quite tense
I don't need your senti-crap now!

344
00:24:36,984 --> 00:24:38,349
And I don't need two moms.

345
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,509
I am getting sentimental?

346
00:24:41,655 --> 00:24:43,384
It's a one year course..

347
00:24:43,891 --> 00:24:47,452
.. in another country
without telling anyone..

348
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:48,961
.. and this is your good news?

349
00:24:49,663 --> 00:24:50,823
You're unbelievable.

350
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:53,765
I didn't tell you 'cos I
knew you would react like this..

351
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,434
There's a difference
between a plan and a decision.

352
00:24:56,503 --> 00:24:58,698
If this was so important for you
why didn't you tell me before?

353
00:24:58,739 --> 00:25:00,866
Why are you all so bloody emotional?

354
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:02,401
Gelato, understand!

355
00:25:02,476 --> 00:25:05,639
Thought I'd surprise you guys
once the scholarship comes in.

356
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,408
I didn't think mom would react
badly to a Communications course.

357
00:25:08,649 --> 00:25:09,877
And me?

358
00:25:12,352 --> 00:25:13,910
I shouldn't react either?

359
00:25:16,456 --> 00:25:17,980
I know. I'm sorry.

360
00:25:18,525 --> 00:25:19,685
I knew you'd freak out, and so..

361
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,352
I freak out 'cos I'm always..

362
00:25:21,428 --> 00:25:23,555
.. competing with
your lists and plans.

363
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:26,390
Where do I fit in your life, Aaliya?

364
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:28,434
Where do you fit in your own life?

365
00:25:28,502 --> 00:25:29,833
Don't like what you're doing.

366
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,564
Don't know what you want to do.

367
00:25:31,638 --> 00:25:34,539
And you've the nerve to tell me
that I shouldn't follow my dreams.

368
00:25:34,608 --> 00:25:36,371
You're doing it again!

369
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:37,635
Instead of pointing out my flaws..

370
00:25:37,711 --> 00:25:39,542
.. focus on your actions,
for a change.

371
00:25:39,613 --> 00:25:40,739
I'm trying to.

372
00:25:40,814 --> 00:25:43,681
You wouldn't be angry if
you understood 'focus'!

373
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,477
You're a boring
executive in your dad's office..

374
00:25:46,553 --> 00:25:47,815
..who doesn't even know himself..

375
00:25:47,888 --> 00:25:49,355
..and you're okay with it!

376
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,353
Where is the fire,
Abhay? What do you want?

377
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:52,756
I don't know.

378
00:25:53,293 --> 00:25:55,557
But I'm not scared to
admit this truth. Unlike you.

379
00:25:55,629 --> 00:25:57,597
Who's only solution
to problems is lying!

380
00:25:57,664 --> 00:26:00,360
Because you can't hear the truth,
Abhay. You're too scared!

381
00:26:01,568 --> 00:26:03,627
Try me, Al.
- Fine.

382
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,395
You don't have a life.
I am your life.

383
00:26:06,573 --> 00:26:10,009
Your life shouldn't be disturbed,
and to hell with mine!

384
00:26:10,577 --> 00:26:12,704
I'm not your 'love'. I'm your habit!

385
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,576
You're actually defending this?

386
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,807
You're lying and telling
me I don't really love you?

387
00:26:17,851 --> 00:26:19,614
You're pathetic.
- And you're delusional!

388
00:26:19,686 --> 00:26:21,483
You've decided to go to Australia..

389
00:26:21,555 --> 00:26:23,887
So your mom and I
should just 'deal with it'!

390
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,323
To hell with our feelings.
- What about my feelings?

391
00:26:26,393 --> 00:26:27,724
You don't have any.

392
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,955
You're just a
selfish programmed robot.

393
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,759
You couldn't
communicate with two people..

394
00:26:31,832 --> 00:26:33,459
.. and you want to do
'Mass' Communications.

395
00:26:47,014 --> 00:26:52,008
So you think he's unambitious,
unhappy..

396
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:54,319
.. and lacks focus.

397
00:26:54,922 --> 00:26:56,549
And his problem is that you're..

398
00:26:56,623 --> 00:27:00,252
.. over-ambitious, you
focus on everything..

399
00:27:00,394 --> 00:27:01,622
.. except him.

400
00:27:02,462 --> 00:27:03,656
And you know what?

401
00:27:04,731 --> 00:27:05,959
I see his point.

402
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,697
You two should
seriously get married!

403
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:09,929
What a pair!

404
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:14,667
You're casually joking
about this 'cos you know..

405
00:27:14,741 --> 00:27:16,470
.. how committed he is towards you.

406
00:27:16,643 --> 00:27:19,976
No matter what, he
will still love you.

407
00:27:20,614 --> 00:27:24,243
I need some space from that love.
- Bravo.

408
00:27:24,551 --> 00:27:26,416
Spoken like your dad's daughter!

409
00:27:26,954 --> 00:27:29,252
Dad cheated on you, ma!

410
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,787
And what did you do?

411
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,460
Lied to me, as usual.

412
00:27:36,296 --> 00:27:37,524
For what, Aunty?

413
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,632
A silly course. A year long course.

414
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:42,530
Stop whining!

415
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:45,900
Telling you late is not lying!

416
00:27:46,306 --> 00:27:49,537
She's no saint but
she's independent.

417
00:27:49,676 --> 00:27:54,306
So let her be. Why
does it bother you?

418
00:27:54,581 --> 00:27:57,414
Why cook for an army over this?

419
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:00,349
Aaliya is independent, adventurous..

420
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,287
.. wants to experience everything.

421
00:28:02,456 --> 00:28:03,718
And I love that about her.

422
00:28:04,424 --> 00:28:06,722
But that's what's
throwing me out of her life.

423
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,293
And she's okay with that.

424
00:28:08,362 --> 00:28:09,693
What's wrong with that?

425
00:28:09,763 --> 00:28:12,425
I want to travel. See the world.

426
00:28:12,532 --> 00:28:14,625
Live on my own, free as a bird.

427
00:28:15,635 --> 00:28:17,500
Are we threatening your freedom?

428
00:28:17,637 --> 00:28:19,696
Buddy boy, go or not..

429
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,999
If she's even thinking about going..

430
00:28:22,275 --> 00:28:23,765
.. one thing's for sure.

431
00:28:23,944 --> 00:28:25,571
Are you breaking up with him?

432
00:29:55,402 --> 00:29:57,370
She wants to act!

433
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,731
And Acting is the most
popular course of that college.

434
00:30:00,907 --> 00:30:02,602
I'm sure you noticed that.

435
00:30:02,943 --> 00:30:06,743
This is just an
excuse to get out of here.

436
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,908
When Aaliya was six..

437
00:30:11,485 --> 00:30:16,616
.. she convinced her teacher
that she couldn't do homework

438
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,926
As her actress mom
couldn't pack her lunch-box..

439
00:30:21,628 --> 00:30:24,392
.. and Aaliya had to do
all her chores herself.

440
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:28,562
Just to escape homework!

441
00:30:28,935 --> 00:30:30,334
You know what?

442
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,971
If I was Aaliya's teacher..

443
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,341
.. I'd have bought
the story as well.

444
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:37,033
Aaliya is that good.

445
00:30:37,677 --> 00:30:42,705
These small lies are just a
rehearsal to become an actress.

446
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,578
She thinks it's fun.

447
00:30:53,527 --> 00:30:57,463
Who knows what she
might do in Australia?

448
00:30:58,832 --> 00:31:03,394
She hasn't seen the real,
ugly side of this world..

449
00:31:04,938 --> 00:31:06,599
.. which I have.

450
00:31:07,674 --> 00:31:09,403
I was married to it.

451
00:31:12,012 --> 00:31:13,946
There are all sorts of
people in this world..

452
00:31:14,648 --> 00:31:16,411
.. notjust one's like Al's dad.

453
00:31:18,818 --> 00:31:20,342
She will make mistakes.

454
00:31:20,854 --> 00:31:22,344
And she has a right to.

455
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:27,419
How else will your
stubborn daughter learn?

456
00:31:34,067 --> 00:31:35,694
The blemish is inside, not on it.

457
00:31:36,002 --> 00:31:37,299
Let it be.

458
00:31:38,471 --> 00:31:40,405
That's what makes it unique!

459
00:32:39,065 --> 00:32:40,657
Aunty has one condition.

460
00:32:42,802 --> 00:32:45,828
Only Communications. No acting.

461
00:33:02,322 --> 00:33:07,658
Al. I'm doing a boring
job in my dad's office..

462
00:33:09,296 --> 00:33:10,854
But I'm not lying to myself.

463
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:13,492
I know. I'm sorry.

464
00:33:13,566 --> 00:33:15,329
But..
- I know.

465
00:33:17,337 --> 00:33:18,964
I don't want to lose myself either.

466
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,569
Take a risk, Gulati.

467
00:33:22,776 --> 00:33:24,573
You're the smartest guy I know.

468
00:33:24,644 --> 00:33:26,578
If you stay so safe..
- You balance that..

469
00:33:26,813 --> 00:33:27,939
.. Risk-taker!

470
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:30,611
You're even risking us.

471
00:33:30,684 --> 00:33:32,982
Are you mad? What risk!

472
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,355
Aren't we still together after
yesterday's record-breaking fight.

473
00:33:36,923 --> 00:33:38,948
A year's break won't
make any difference.

474
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:42,551
What 'break'?

475
00:33:42,796 --> 00:33:44,423
Don't be an idiot.

476
00:33:44,497 --> 00:33:47,022
Being apart for a year
is an obvious break!

477
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,331
Al, one doesn't apply for
'casual leave' in a relationship!

478
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,001
Are you breaking up with me?

479
00:33:54,341 --> 00:33:56,969
No, you sentimental freak!
Don't complicate it.

480
00:33:57,377 --> 00:34:00,574
This is not a break-up,
this is just a little.. break.

481
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,711
What does a 'little break' mean, Al?

482
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,445
Think before you answer.

483
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,654
Do you know what a
'little break' is?

484
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:15,625
No, but I know that we need it.

485
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,889
We need to find ourselves.

486
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,928
I just hope we don't lose each
other while finding ourselves.

487
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:23,797
We won't.

488
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,437
You won't let it happen.

489
00:34:28,675 --> 00:34:30,404
Don't lose hope, Gulati.

490
00:34:34,748 --> 00:34:35,942
What are you thinking?

491
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,946
It's time to fax the
'Thread Maintenance Dept.'

492
00:35:22,595 --> 00:35:25,496
Don't lie, I know
you're missing no one.

493
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:28,724
Met your aunt yet? - No, but
she's lived in Oz for twenty years.

494
00:35:28,802 --> 00:35:31,032
Besides, mom's sister
is bound to be cool.

495
00:35:46,953 --> 00:35:49,649
Ayesha first spoiled you
and now she's regretting it.

496
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:54,453
Had you come to me earlier
she wouldn't be ruing this day.

497
00:35:54,928 --> 00:35:57,453
What's wrong with this day?

498
00:35:57,664 --> 00:35:58,824
You don't like Tuesdays?

499
00:35:59,899 --> 00:36:02,367
No boys, no late-nights.

500
00:36:02,435 --> 00:36:04,630
And no phone calls after eleven.

501
00:36:06,439 --> 00:36:07,497
What?

502
00:36:07,574 --> 00:36:10,008
I need to pee. Shall I hold or wait?

503
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:22,377
And finally a whiff of fresh air..

504
00:36:24,824 --> 00:36:29,693
.. as our bound arms
stretch themselves.

505
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:35,497
My heart wants to hum..

506
00:36:35,668 --> 00:36:39,331
While he wants to sing..

507
00:36:39,506 --> 00:36:43,033
I smile, he giggles..

508
00:36:43,943 --> 00:36:47,435
.. powerless
against this crazy whim.

509
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:53,546
Distances are important too.

510
00:36:54,387 --> 00:37:02,419
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

511
00:37:03,363 --> 00:37:08,801
Distances are important too.

512
00:37:09,536 --> 00:37:17,773
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

513
00:37:18,745 --> 00:37:24,547
Distances are important too.

514
00:37:25,251 --> 00:37:33,590
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

515
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,789
She said my skirt's
too short! Change it.

516
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,329
Imagine! Even Ayesha
never said this to me!

517
00:37:39,399 --> 00:37:41,492
But why are we discussing her?
- Thank you.

518
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:44,794
The kids were
missing you today. -Who?

519
00:37:44,871 --> 00:37:46,930
The kids we meet at the signal, Al!

520
00:37:47,574 --> 00:37:49,872
You've forgotten them already?
- Don't be silly.

521
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,742
Hey, if I murder my aunt..

522
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,610
.. where should I hide
her body? -Al, please.

523
00:37:55,748 --> 00:37:57,841
Can we please talk
about something else?

524
00:37:57,917 --> 00:38:01,409
I have to live with her,
Gulati! -So do I.

525
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,852
Gelato, guess what?

526
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,286
Your aunt is wearing a bikini
and head banging in the campus.

527
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:08,350
I was not talking about her.

528
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,687
Sometimes you're more
irritating than my aunt!

529
00:38:11,764 --> 00:38:13,629
And we're back to your aunt!

530
00:38:14,434 --> 00:38:16,265
Alright. We'll talk about aunt only.

531
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:21,399
Such intimacy sows
seeds of distances..

532
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:29,246
.. don't be fooled,
these waters are not sweet.

533
00:38:30,717 --> 00:38:34,585
Look but don't touch; its fire..

534
00:38:34,654 --> 00:38:38,454
..just watch it shimmer from afar..

535
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:42,858
..any closer and you could burn..

536
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:46,922
..powerless against this crazy whim.

537
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,734
Distances are important too.

538
00:38:53,306 --> 00:38:58,710
Sometimes you gotta
chase space. - Hi, guys.

539
00:38:58,778 --> 00:39:01,747
Hi, I'm Rishabh.
- Hi, Aaliya.

540
00:39:01,814 --> 00:39:03,543
You were really good today.
- Thanks.

541
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,453
God, my aunt.

542
00:39:11,257 --> 00:39:12,554
Gotta go, guys.

543
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:18,789
It's 10 O' clock.
She could've called me.

544
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,226
I don't know what to do with her.

545
00:39:21,534 --> 00:39:22,762
She just walked in.

546
00:39:22,835 --> 00:39:26,669
Ayesha, I agreed to house my niece,
not to become part of local gossip!

547
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,569
She thinks it's ok to be
wild 'cos this is Australia!

548
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:33,641
Has no respect for elders.

549
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:27,296
It's called survival, Gelato.

550
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:28,759
So what?

551
00:40:28,835 --> 00:40:30,666
This isn't India, it's Australia.

552
00:40:30,737 --> 00:40:32,432
It's a bench in Australia.

553
00:40:32,605 --> 00:40:34,300
Sounds really adventurous.

554
00:40:35,575 --> 00:40:38,408
Look, dad has a
partner in Melbourne..

555
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,309
Ah! So I should leave
one dictatorship and..

556
00:40:40,379 --> 00:40:42,074
..enter another rulebook!

557
00:40:42,348 --> 00:40:44,612
Know what? Why don't I
just come back home?

558
00:40:44,684 --> 00:40:46,675
Why explore the world, right?

559
00:40:46,753 --> 00:40:48,311
Please don't do that.

560
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,785
Who will do the other
courses in the world?

561
00:40:50,857 --> 00:40:52,620
Like the one in Switzerland,
on Snow Management.

562
00:40:52,692 --> 00:40:54,023
Screw you!

563
00:40:54,093 --> 00:40:56,823
We've been arguing for over two
months! I'm sick of this shit!

564
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,903
I'm.. sorry, I don't want to fight.

565
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:08,404
I just want to help you.

566
00:41:09,275 --> 00:41:12,438
Let's not talk for a few days, ok?

567
00:41:12,812 --> 00:41:14,609
How will that help, Al?

568
00:41:14,981 --> 00:41:16,608
If we don't hear
each other's voices..

569
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,309
..we'll have very little left?

570
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:20,546
No, Gulati.

571
00:41:22,955 --> 00:41:24,388
It'll make us stronger.

572
00:41:36,769 --> 00:41:38,532
Ok. Let's try this as well.

573
00:41:41,474 --> 00:41:42,873
But you're a 'nonsense person'.

574
00:41:43,676 --> 00:41:45,439
Bye, sweety.

575
00:41:45,511 --> 00:41:47,376
I love you, sweety.

576
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,285
I've never felt so
pathetically poor.

577
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,256
Who can afford 200 dollars a month?

578
00:42:03,496 --> 00:42:04,724
I'm screwed, man.

579
00:42:05,965 --> 00:42:09,366
Hey, I have an idea!

580
00:42:10,603 --> 00:42:12,867
You can stay where I live
if you pay advance rent.

581
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,896
Six hundred for six months.

582
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:16,833
Sorted!

583
00:42:17,443 --> 00:42:18,535
What?
- Yup.

584
00:42:18,611 --> 00:42:20,738
That's awesome. Thank you.

585
00:42:35,661 --> 00:42:37,788
Did you leave this pink
toothbrush in my bathroom?

586
00:42:37,997 --> 00:42:40,329
What?
- I did.

587
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,424
Good. Come.

588
00:42:46,472 --> 00:42:49,999
Last night was sensational.
- Deja vouz!

589
00:42:50,076 --> 00:42:51,703
That's yours.

590
00:42:51,911 --> 00:42:54,573
That's the way. Don't call.

591
00:42:54,647 --> 00:42:56,842
I'll call or not.

592
00:42:58,351 --> 00:43:00,842
Were there the two of
you last night? - No, I'm..

593
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,410
No one cares who you are.

594
00:43:02,488 --> 00:43:03,955
Get out.
- Excuse me?

595
00:43:04,023 --> 00:43:06,423
Are you dumb and deaf? No
one gives a shit who you are!

596
00:43:06,492 --> 00:43:07,857
She needs to take a shit!

597
00:43:07,927 --> 00:43:09,326
But.. -Why aren't you at the shack?

598
00:43:09,395 --> 00:43:10,487
I wasn't in the mood.

599
00:43:10,563 --> 00:43:11,894
I'm in the mood to cut
your wage. -Just a sec..

600
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,454
You can't cut your
elder brother's pay.

601
00:43:13,499 --> 00:43:14,932
Bite me!

602
00:43:15,001 --> 00:43:16,764
You work for me. I own that shack!

603
00:43:16,836 --> 00:43:18,497
Don't make me angry, Cyrus.

604
00:43:18,738 --> 00:43:20,933
You're Cyrus? Is this your house?

605
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,275
Wow! Ms. India has brains too.

606
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,401
She's not your type.

607
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:25,774
And you
- that's called a door..

608
00:43:25,845 --> 00:43:28,780
.. and if you lift those two,
you might discover walking.

609
00:43:28,848 --> 00:43:29,974
Excuse me.

610
00:43:30,016 --> 00:43:32,576
Or we can do something
else with them. - What?

611
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,381
This is not a freaking motel, Cy!

612
00:43:37,456 --> 00:43:38,753
Thanks, that was butt ugly.

613
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:39,916
Freaks, I'm Aaliya..

614
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,289
Rishabh sent me here.
- Aaliya.

615
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,520
Why didn't you say that earlier?

616
00:43:42,595 --> 00:43:43,857
He finally got a hot babe.

617
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,830
We were expecting you..
- I'm not his babe.

618
00:43:45,898 --> 00:43:48,526
Sorry about the confusion..
got the rent?

619
00:43:49,702 --> 00:43:51,567
600 dollars.
- Are you single?

620
00:43:51,704 --> 00:43:54,673
What? - You'll need to
learn to ignore my brother.

621
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,398
Can I feel that butt?

622
00:43:56,876 --> 00:44:01,245
I've handled bigger sleazes in
Delhi buses. You're nothing.

623
00:44:01,614 --> 00:44:03,445
Nads.
- Yes.

624
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:04,983
What's a 'sleazoid'?

625
00:44:05,651 --> 00:44:08,313
Oh, by the way. I am Nadia.

626
00:44:08,387 --> 00:44:10,378
Hi.
- This feels good.

627
00:44:10,456 --> 00:44:12,321
Spank me while you're at it.

628
00:44:15,795 --> 00:44:17,524
Our house.

629
00:44:17,897 --> 00:44:19,831
The beach bed.

630
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,290
Our beach shack.

631
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:27,704
Where we rent out surfboards. Cyrus!

632
00:44:28,341 --> 00:44:30,969
My real talents emerge at the bar!

633
00:44:32,778 --> 00:44:34,575
Nadia likes pain.

634
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:37,907
And your room.

635
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,909
If you need anything..
don't tell me.

636
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:45,852
It's perfect.

637
00:44:45,925 --> 00:44:51,625
Distances are important too..

638
00:44:51,998 --> 00:44:57,959
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

639
00:44:58,037 --> 00:45:06,877
Distances are important too..

640
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:13,444
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

641
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:22,484
Distances are important too..

642
00:45:22,695 --> 00:45:28,895
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

643
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,536
Let me see.

644
00:45:39,745 --> 00:45:43,272
Why don't you just tell your parents
you don't want to get married.

645
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:46,747
You don't know them.

646
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,753
It's easier to get married.

647
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,583
No, it's easier to get laid.

648
00:45:52,658 --> 00:45:55,650
Let's Party, you losers!
- Party!

649
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:01,384
Gelato! !
- How are you?

650
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,855
Thirty days and thirty hours.
Not bad, huh!

651
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:06,659
Can't hear a thing, hang on..

652
00:47:06,732 --> 00:47:08,290
Move your ass!

653
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,700
I'd love to, but..
who's dying behind you?

654
00:47:13,572 --> 00:47:15,699
It's Cyrus. He's nuts!

655
00:47:15,774 --> 00:47:20,507
I'm in an amazing place.
My room is sea-facing!

656
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:24,004
I'm living in a private island..
for just six hundred dollars!

657
00:47:24,416 --> 00:47:28,819
That's.. cheap, right?
-Super cheap. And for six months.

658
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:30,719
Six hundred for six months?

659
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:33,282
Sounds too good to be true, Al.

660
00:47:33,459 --> 00:47:34,619
You doubt so much, Gelato.

661
00:47:34,693 --> 00:47:36,923
Why so serious?

662
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,968
Why's everyone screaming,
What kind of a party is this?

663
00:47:43,035 --> 00:47:46,835
It's unbelievably crazy!
We've been partying for two days.

664
00:47:46,872 --> 00:47:49,636
It's Rishab's farewell
party and everyone's smashed!

665
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:51,733
Enough about me. How are you?

666
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:53,845
Same shit, different day!

667
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:56,510
Who's Rishab?

668
00:47:56,982 --> 00:47:58,711
A sexy stud! Happy?

669
00:47:58,851 --> 00:48:00,876
We're all friends and live together.

670
00:48:00,953 --> 00:48:03,387
Chill, Al. I haven't
heard your voice for a month.

671
00:48:03,556 --> 00:48:05,456
You've made new friends.

672
00:48:05,491 --> 00:48:07,686
Let's get naked!

673
00:48:09,361 --> 00:48:11,522
Who.. hate their clothes,

674
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:13,357
New place, new friends.

675
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,660
It's natural, Gulati.

676
00:48:14,733 --> 00:48:17,793
Don't assume what
you can't see is shady!

677
00:48:18,704 --> 00:48:20,831
Know what? I don't want to argue.

678
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:24,503
You want me to understand your
life after you throw me out of it?

679
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:26,837
What are you doing, Al?
Why are you fighting ?

680
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,744
I'm taking a break.

681
00:48:29,815 --> 00:48:30,907
Hello?

682
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:32,777
Damn!

683
00:48:51,737 --> 00:48:53,830
Look, fighting will
not help anything..

684
00:48:53,906 --> 00:48:55,032
Buddy..

685
00:48:55,841 --> 00:48:57,536
You're in a long queue here!

686
00:48:59,712 --> 00:49:01,907
You're in queue!

687
00:49:03,582 --> 00:49:05,777
I just need.. a break.

688
00:49:15,728 --> 00:49:17,389
Six in the evening?

689
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:25,498
What the..

690
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:31,799
Thank God for small mercies!

691
00:49:34,947 --> 00:49:38,246
O' what a beautiful.. Hello! !

692
00:49:38,284 --> 00:49:39,774
Congratulations!
- On?

693
00:49:40,252 --> 00:49:42,345
On finally getting some action.
- What?

694
00:49:42,588 --> 00:49:43,919
Look at her, dude.

695
00:49:43,989 --> 00:49:45,547
She has more
facial hair than Rishab.

696
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:48,383
Why do you think
he brought you here?

697
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,893
For some 'lurve'.

698
00:49:50,329 --> 00:49:51,796
Just wanted a piece of heaven..

699
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:55,493
.. before he spent the
rest of his life in hell!

700
00:49:55,567 --> 00:49:57,398
You asshole! Get up.

701
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,330
I thought you were a friend..

702
00:49:59,405 --> 00:50:00,531
I'll cut your..

703
00:50:00,606 --> 00:50:01,903
Into so many pieces..

704
00:50:01,974 --> 00:50:05,375
.. you'll never be able to have sex

705
00:50:05,511 --> 00:50:07,001
Hang on.
- Shut up.

706
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,012
Listen..
- How could you even think about..

707
00:50:13,419 --> 00:50:15,649
I'm going to kill you.. !
- What happened?

708
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:18,383
Gulati, what the
hell are you doing here?

709
00:50:18,457 --> 00:50:20,755
Looked cute, so I let him in.
- What!

710
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:22,827
Did you touch her?
- He's your boyfriend?

711
00:50:23,529 --> 00:50:25,827
Abhay, stop it. Spank him harder.

712
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:28,423
Did you touch her?
- I don't remember.

713
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,663
What?
- You asshole. 'Don't remember'!

714
00:50:31,937 --> 00:50:34,565
There's nothing to remember.
- What did he do?

715
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,403
Gulati, nothing happened.

716
00:50:36,675 --> 00:50:38,575
What's a 'Gulati'?
- I knew something was wrong.

717
00:50:38,644 --> 00:50:39,872
Now he would be able
to touch any girl again.

718
00:50:39,945 --> 00:50:41,469
He's running away.

719
00:50:43,716 --> 00:50:46,082
Stop recording, man!
- Come in.

720
00:50:46,352 --> 00:50:48,047
This is so going on You Tube.

721
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:53,519
How'd you get here so soon?

722
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:54,889
We just spoke today.

723
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,393
We spoke yesterday, Al.

724
00:50:56,462 --> 00:50:58,453
And five minutes later, a
drunk man picked up your phone ..

725
00:50:58,530 --> 00:50:59,656
.. and told me to ''get in line''.

726
00:50:59,732 --> 00:51:01,029
But I told you to back-off.

727
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,325
Why call in the first place?

728
00:51:03,669 --> 00:51:05,603
Why can't you deal with this break?

729
00:51:05,671 --> 00:51:07,332
Break doesn't mean..

730
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,002
And what the hell does
a 'break' mean anyway?

731
00:51:09,041 --> 00:51:11,407
It means she's dumped you! !

732
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:15,476
I was so hoping you
wouldn't feel insecure.

733
00:51:15,547 --> 00:51:18,277
''Don't help me. Don't
discuss my problems.Don't call me.''

734
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:19,612
You have a problem with everything.

735
00:51:19,685 --> 00:51:20,777
Your only response is fear.

736
00:51:20,853 --> 00:51:22,582
You do that to people, Al.

737
00:51:22,654 --> 00:51:24,815
Your mom found out two days
later that you're not at your aunt's.

738
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:27,324
She was so freaked out.
- Don't drag Ayesha into this.

739
00:51:27,393 --> 00:51:28,724
She didn't come running here.

740
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,762
'Cos I keep
telling her to trust you.

741
00:51:30,829 --> 00:51:32,729
Since you got here..
- Don't start.

742
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,356
You're here 'cos you've got issues.

743
00:51:34,433 --> 00:51:35,593
We have issues, Al.

744
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:36,725
You're so blinded by your dreams..

745
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:39,430
I don't want to deal
with your problems.

746
00:51:40,005 --> 00:51:43,463
This is it. - You don't want
to deal with our problems.

747
00:51:43,542 --> 00:51:45,442
You're not taking a break,
you're running away.

748
00:51:45,944 --> 00:51:47,434
I am breaking up with you.

749
00:51:52,451 --> 00:51:53,645
You don't mean that.

750
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:55,411
I do.

751
00:51:58,957 --> 00:52:00,447
I can't do this anymore.

752
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:04,491
One little problem and
you throw it all away?

753
00:52:05,431 --> 00:52:06,659
That's your quick fix?

754
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,526
And so easy for you to do?

755
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,559
It's become so complicated
that nothing else can be done.

756
00:52:12,771 --> 00:52:15,501
It's not complicated, it's
just inconvenient for you.

757
00:52:15,574 --> 00:52:17,735
You don't want it, right? Fine.

758
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:19,502
But I won't accept it.

759
00:52:19,578 --> 00:52:20,806
We're not over just
because you say it's over.

760
00:52:20,879 --> 00:52:22,369
Just let it go, Abhay!

761
00:52:31,723 --> 00:52:33,816
We can't be over when
you snap your fingers.

762
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,360
Relationships are built by
togetherness, not space!

763
00:52:37,429 --> 00:52:38,987
Your priorities have changed,
not mine.

764
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:41,332
We will fix this.

765
00:52:41,767 --> 00:52:45,032
Until you come back to your senses..

766
00:52:45,604 --> 00:52:48,004
.. and listen carefully
for I mean every word..

767
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,030
I'm NOT going anywhere!

768
00:52:50,676 --> 00:52:51,870
I'm staying right here.

769
00:52:53,011 --> 00:52:54,842
You've lost it, Abhay.

770
00:52:55,013 --> 00:52:57,038
And what do you mean by ''here''?

771
00:52:57,416 --> 00:52:59,407
Where will you stay?
- Stay here, dude.

772
00:52:59,852 --> 00:53:00,910
What?
- What?

773
00:53:00,986 --> 00:53:02,476
I like you.
- Really?

774
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:05,580
Nads, I got here first,
I've paid advance rent.

775
00:53:05,657 --> 00:53:07,648
Not in a man-love way.

776
00:53:07,793 --> 00:53:09,761
I just.. 'like' you!,

777
00:53:10,929 --> 00:53:13,557
He ain't leavingjust
'cos you say so. So chill.

778
00:53:13,632 --> 00:53:16,294
When's your flight?
- Tomorrow.

779
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,297
And we don't want you to miss it.

780
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:20,270
So you can spend the
night at the airport.

781
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:21,431
But..
- What?

782
00:53:21,507 --> 00:53:23,600
Advance rent.. ?
- Six months, I know.

783
00:53:23,675 --> 00:53:25,006
I'm Abhay.
- Nadia.

784
00:53:25,277 --> 00:53:26,767
And I am the retard.

785
00:53:27,479 --> 00:53:29,674
No. No, no, no.

786
00:53:29,715 --> 00:53:32,275
One second. You and I can't
live under the same roof..

787
00:53:32,351 --> 00:53:34,876
Why not? - Because.. - I'm
your EX-boyfriend, right?

788
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,689
Know what? You're right.

789
00:53:38,891 --> 00:53:40,552
Please stay here.

790
00:53:40,626 --> 00:53:41,991
But we're so through.

791
00:53:44,496 --> 00:53:45,724
My stuff?

792
00:53:48,033 --> 00:53:49,398
I'll take it later.

793
00:53:57,743 --> 00:53:59,233
Lose unwanted weight.

794
00:53:59,311 --> 00:54:00,801
Make your body look attractive.

795
00:54:00,879 --> 00:54:02,870
Pick up the phone and order now.

796
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,575
Telemall's Home Jogger.

797
00:54:05,484 --> 00:54:08,942
Either you're really
stupid or really blind.

798
00:54:09,321 --> 00:54:11,687
''Gulati, what the hell
are you doing here?''

799
00:54:13,692 --> 00:54:15,626
One day, I gave a girl my word..

800
00:54:16,261 --> 00:54:19,560
.. that I will never
let us break apart.

801
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,293
And I intend to keep my word.

802
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,368
Say goodbye to obesity, but not us.

803
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,633
We will return with
this unique invention..

804
00:54:32,711 --> 00:54:34,941
.. after a short break!

805
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,871
You're up early!
What's the time there?

806
00:54:59,316 --> 00:55:03,252
Eight in the morning.

807
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:05,878
That's funny, even here..

808
00:55:06,624 --> 00:55:10,651
My neighbour's a strange girl..

809
00:55:11,695 --> 00:55:15,756
..with strange signs,
can't read her mind.

810
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:20,602
My neighbour's a strange girl..

811
00:55:21,705 --> 00:55:25,766
..with strange signs,
can't read her mind.

812
00:55:26,877 --> 00:55:30,938
My life's in a strange phase..

813
00:55:31,649 --> 00:55:36,245
..And teases in strange ways.

814
00:55:36,954 --> 00:55:40,981
My life's in a strange phase..

815
00:55:41,558 --> 00:55:46,188
..And teases in strange ways.

816
00:55:46,664 --> 00:55:50,600
My neighbour's a strange girl..

817
00:55:51,669 --> 00:55:55,730
.. with strange signs,
can't read her mind.

818
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:57,232
Shit!

819
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:02,141
I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

820
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,306
How about some breakfast?

821
00:56:13,824 --> 00:56:16,816
Not your credit cards! !
Have you lost it?

822
00:56:16,994 --> 00:56:18,120
It's not worth it, dude.

823
00:56:18,262 --> 00:56:19,786
Not for a girl.

824
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:21,022
Go on, Abhay, do it.

825
00:56:21,231 --> 00:56:22,596
Don't listen to her.

826
00:56:22,666 --> 00:56:23,826
She doesn't even believe in love.

827
00:56:24,068 --> 00:56:26,059
I believe in respect. Screw love.

828
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:30,102
Well done!.

829
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:33,868
Last one.

830
00:56:36,313 --> 00:56:37,610
Dude!

831
00:56:46,957 --> 00:56:56,025
Such a cruel thirst, I see
but not sip this water..

832
00:56:56,967 --> 00:57:05,932
..I live my dreams in
such a cruel reality.

833
00:57:06,777 --> 00:57:10,611
A strange possibilities,
they open a window..

834
00:57:10,681 --> 00:57:13,844
..only to cast a stranger view!

835
00:57:14,284 --> 00:57:16,775
Yes, he's 'sweet'! Should
I make a candy out of him?

836
00:57:17,254 --> 00:57:19,085
This drama has gone
on for two months!

837
00:57:19,323 --> 00:57:20,813
Breaking up was easier.

838
00:57:20,924 --> 00:57:23,290
Nothing's difficult,
aunty. She's just a bit miffed.

839
00:57:24,161 --> 00:57:25,355
But I have a plan.

840
00:57:25,796 --> 00:57:27,730
See each other's point of
view instead of fighting.

841
00:57:27,798 --> 00:57:28,924
I'm trying to do that.

842
00:57:28,999 --> 00:57:30,967
That's what I'm doing,
- No, not you, son.

843
00:57:31,235 --> 00:57:32,634
Stop yelling, Aaliya.

844
00:57:32,703 --> 00:57:33,761
I'm not yelling.

845
00:57:33,837 --> 00:57:36,704
I'm trying to make him see..
- That's it..

846
00:57:36,774 --> 00:57:38,241
..it's a pointless fight.

847
00:57:38,642 --> 00:57:40,906
I don't know what he wants.
- I know what she wants.

848
00:57:45,015 --> 00:57:46,949
Get off the phone.

849
00:57:47,651 --> 00:57:48,948
What's your problem,

850
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:51,281
Why're you calling Ayesha?

851
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:52,613
She's my mom.

852
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:55,791
My mom, my life, my house, my..

853
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,252
..and your room too.

854
00:57:57,828 --> 00:57:58,920
Hello!

855
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:00,688
What are you doing here?

856
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,025
I'm taking a RISK.

857
00:58:02,866 --> 00:58:05,300
Didn't you say people could
never be friends after a break-up?

858
00:58:08,071 --> 00:58:10,198
Correct. But this is a
break-up only for you.

859
00:58:10,607 --> 00:58:11,938
For me it's..
- A challenge!

860
00:58:12,676 --> 00:58:14,007
''How can this happen to me?''

861
00:58:14,178 --> 00:58:16,840
''I've even chosen our kids' names!''

862
00:58:17,014 --> 00:58:18,072
Babies?

863
00:58:18,849 --> 00:58:19,907
Nonsense!

864
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:21,747
I know the
responsibility of world population..

865
00:58:21,819 --> 00:58:23,081
..lies on your delicate shoulders.

866
00:58:23,854 --> 00:58:24,946
We'll plant trees!

867
00:58:27,291 --> 00:58:30,226
And now she walks away
to lead her secret life..

868
00:58:30,294 --> 00:58:31,659
..so don't forget your script!

869
00:58:36,233 --> 00:58:37,291
Al..
- Don't.

870
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:41,635
Extra rent for babies and trees!

871
00:58:42,806 --> 00:58:51,737
The ocean has
erased our footprints..

872
00:58:52,783 --> 00:59:01,714
..and a stray breeze
sprinkles nostalgia over me.

873
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:04,886
Strangeness is all around..

874
00:59:04,962 --> 00:59:07,556
..it's raining moon and stars.

875
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:11,294
My neighbour's a strange girl..

876
00:59:12,269 --> 00:59:16,205
My neighbour's a strange girl..

877
00:59:17,341 --> 00:59:21,801
..with strange signs,
can't read her mind.

878
00:59:22,312 --> 00:59:26,271
My neighbour's a strange girl..

879
00:59:27,317 --> 00:59:31,686
..with strange signs,
can't read her mind.

880
00:59:39,897 --> 00:59:40,921
This month's rent.

881
00:59:42,532 --> 00:59:43,726
Have you seen your face?

882
00:59:44,801 --> 00:59:45,893
Actually, no.

883
00:59:46,236 --> 00:59:47,294
You look like crap.

884
00:59:47,971 --> 00:59:49,666
Nads, nothing you
say can make me feel..

885
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:51,139
She doesn't love you.

886
00:59:51,775 --> 00:59:54,141
Round one to Nads.

887
00:59:56,213 --> 01:00:00,172
So we should love people
only till they love us back?

888
01:00:03,921 --> 01:00:06,048
No, Nads. You can't marry him.

889
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:09,024
Nad's dude cheated on
her and since then..

890
01:00:09,092 --> 01:00:10,150
Butt out, Cy!

891
01:00:11,728 --> 01:00:13,559
Just take it.

892
01:00:14,998 --> 01:00:17,330
Just get some real clothes.

893
01:00:19,036 --> 01:00:23,564
She really likes you, bro,
'cos she never refuses money!

894
01:00:23,774 --> 01:00:26,242
She loves money.
- Our dead parents' money.

895
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:27,607
And I own half of it.

896
01:00:27,678 --> 01:00:29,646
You will, once you get
out of this beer can..

897
01:00:30,347 --> 01:00:32,178
So how long were you
guys together for?

898
01:00:33,917 --> 01:00:35,009
Ten years.

899
01:00:35,085 --> 01:00:38,851
Ten! One girl! One girl! Disgusting!

900
01:00:44,995 --> 01:00:48,931
My neighbour's a strange girl..

901
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,096
..with strange signs,
can't read her mind.

902
01:00:54,972 --> 01:00:58,931
My neighbour's a strange girl..

903
01:00:59,977 --> 01:01:04,038
..with strange signs,
can't read her mind.

904
01:01:05,215 --> 01:01:09,584
My life's in a strange phase..

905
01:01:09,853 --> 01:01:14,756
..And teases in strange ways.

906
01:01:15,225 --> 01:01:19,286
My life's in a strange phase..

907
01:01:19,896 --> 01:01:24,765
..And teases in strange ways.

908
01:01:25,035 --> 01:01:28,937
My neighbour's a strange girl.

909
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:34,204
..with strange signs,
can't read her mind.

910
01:01:35,045 --> 01:01:38,913
My neighbour's a strange girl.

911
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:44,114
..with strange signs,
can't read her mind.

912
01:01:44,955 --> 01:01:48,891
My neighbour's a strange girl.

913
01:01:49,893 --> 01:01:55,058
..with strange signs,
can't read her mind.

914
01:02:20,557 --> 01:02:21,649
Brother Javed.

915
01:02:22,325 --> 01:02:23,758
What's the menu today?

916
01:02:24,628 --> 01:02:25,856
Mutton curry and bread.

917
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:29,298
Very funny!

918
01:02:34,738 --> 01:02:35,830
Try some!

919
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:01,697
Come on. Come on.

920
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:27,648
Thanks.

921
01:03:27,824 --> 01:03:28,916
Come on.

922
01:03:34,231 --> 01:03:35,323
Hey.
- Hi.

923
01:03:47,811 --> 01:03:48,869
Two.

924
01:03:49,212 --> 01:03:50,543
Thank you.

925
01:03:53,016 --> 01:03:54,813
Hey.
- Hi.

926
01:03:54,851 --> 01:03:56,113
Nads, want one?
- Sure.

927
01:04:05,595 --> 01:04:06,619
No.

928
01:04:24,114 --> 01:04:26,981
Last month's debt, this and
the next two months' rent.

929
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:28,210
Slow down, Mr. Gates.

930
01:04:29,586 --> 01:04:30,678
Thanks, guys.

931
01:04:32,622 --> 01:04:33,714
Keep it!

932
01:04:33,924 --> 01:04:35,892
What? Enough of this shit!

933
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:37,956
Who made you the
decision maker on the rent?

934
01:04:38,161 --> 01:04:39,560
Is he in love or are you?

935
01:04:39,629 --> 01:04:40,789
It's business, Cy.

936
01:04:42,165 --> 01:04:43,689
I keep the shack deposit.

937
01:04:44,067 --> 01:04:45,694
The rest is the
start-up cost for you two.

938
01:04:46,636 --> 01:04:47,694
Who two?

939
01:04:48,271 --> 01:04:49,568
You two.

940
01:04:49,906 --> 01:04:51,237
That's your kitchen
area from tomorrow.

941
01:04:51,308 --> 01:04:53,606
Your talent, your investment,
my place.

942
01:04:53,977 --> 01:04:56,002
Cy's the manger.
Profit splits three ways.

943
01:04:56,646 --> 01:04:57,704
Deal?

944
01:04:58,181 --> 01:04:59,273
I need a beer.

945
01:04:59,316 --> 01:05:01,648
I won't ask again. You in?

946
01:05:06,623 --> 01:05:08,147
Yes. Yes.

947
01:05:14,231 --> 01:05:15,323
Why are you doing it?

948
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:17,123
'Cos she loves money.

949
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,827
And she hates me.

950
01:05:19,236 --> 01:05:21,204
This is not business, Nads.

951
01:05:22,906 --> 01:05:25,636
Someone should have a happy ending.

952
01:05:52,168 --> 01:05:53,260
Congratulations.

953
01:05:59,743 --> 01:06:02,303
Hi.
- Aaliya Khan.

954
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:04,772
Yes?

955
01:06:04,814 --> 01:06:07,282
Daniel Trip. I'm the
casting director on a film.

956
01:06:07,684 --> 01:06:08,810
We need an Asian actor.

957
01:06:09,686 --> 01:06:10,710
And you're good.

958
01:06:11,087 --> 01:06:14,352
Auditions have begun
and are on for two weeks.

959
01:06:17,827 --> 01:06:20,193
Congratulations
for tonight. Call me!

960
01:06:25,802 --> 01:06:27,064
Come on, girl, smile.

961
01:06:27,137 --> 01:06:28,195
You gonna call him?

962
01:06:58,835 --> 01:07:00,769
Surprise!

963
01:07:02,572 --> 01:07:03,630
Happy birthday, Al.

964
01:07:11,781 --> 01:07:13,646
How can you forget
your own birthday?

965
01:07:13,717 --> 01:07:15,048
It's called old age.

966
01:07:15,251 --> 01:07:16,616
Your momma's old!

967
01:07:16,953 --> 01:07:18,921
I love dirty talk in Hindi.

968
01:07:20,123 --> 01:07:21,954
You guys baked me a cake? How sweet!

969
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:23,251
Aunty made it.

970
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:26,095
He's the cook, I'm the manager!
That's the deal.

971
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:30,326
Happy birthday to you!

972
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:33,294
Happy birthday to you!

973
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:36,764
Happy birthday, dear Aaliya!

974
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:39,238
Happy birthday to you!

975
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,046
Come on.

976
01:07:52,222 --> 01:07:53,883
Hey! Stop it!

977
01:08:22,819 --> 01:08:24,753
Good night, see you tomorrow.
- See you.

978
01:08:51,815 --> 01:08:52,907
Thanks.

979
01:08:55,285 --> 01:08:56,718
I completely forgot my birthday.

980
01:09:02,025 --> 01:09:03,083
You're welcome.

981
01:09:07,864 --> 01:09:08,922
What's up?

982
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:11,759
Nothing.

983
01:09:11,935 --> 01:09:14,165
Al, something's wrong.

984
01:09:18,641 --> 01:09:21,041
I'm.. Nothing.

985
01:09:22,178 --> 01:09:23,270
Come on.

986
01:09:25,748 --> 01:09:27,739
Abhay, can you forget
everything for five minutes?

987
01:09:28,051 --> 01:09:30,713
We were never dating,
we never broke up..

988
01:09:30,854 --> 01:09:32,685
..we're just Abhay
and Aaliya. Friends.

989
01:09:32,889 --> 01:09:34,857
No expectations, no complications?

990
01:09:39,095 --> 01:09:40,187
What happened?

991
01:09:40,830 --> 01:09:42,730
I met a casting agent today..

992
01:09:42,932 --> 01:09:44,024
..he's offered me a film.

993
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,590
It's big.
- That's great.

994
01:09:46,269 --> 01:09:47,759
Oh, no.
- I know.

995
01:09:48,271 --> 01:09:50,831
Your mom.. Most actors
don't get this chance.

996
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,268
And I don't know when I
would get such a chance again..

997
01:09:52,642 --> 01:09:54,576
You're not sure
what's more important.

998
01:09:54,644 --> 01:09:55,702
Acting or your promise to your mom.

999
01:09:55,778 --> 01:09:57,268
I'm a jackass!

1000
01:09:57,647 --> 01:09:58,841
Why did I make that promise?

1001
01:09:59,115 --> 01:10:00,241
I thought I am getting to do a play,

1002
01:10:00,316 --> 01:10:02,716
Ayesha will never know
- it's perfect!

1003
01:10:02,986 --> 01:10:05,750
And now I get a damn International
film in Oz of all the places.

1004
01:10:06,189 --> 01:10:07,816
This doesn't even happen in films.

1005
01:10:08,725 --> 01:10:09,817
What do I do now?

1006
01:10:12,562 --> 01:10:13,654
Speak, Gelato.

1007
01:10:14,831 --> 01:10:16,822
Follow the beat of your heart!
- Meaning?

1008
01:10:20,637 --> 01:10:23,071
Why are love and happiness
different things for people?

1009
01:10:26,809 --> 01:10:29,607
You were right, you were my life.

1010
01:10:30,346 --> 01:10:31,870
Not that again..

1011
01:10:31,948 --> 01:10:33,575
Hear me out, Al.

1012
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:40,016
I was insecure 'cos I didn't
know how someone could be..

1013
01:10:40,089 --> 01:10:42,557
..so passionate about their dreams.

1014
01:10:44,093 --> 01:10:45,185
But I do now.

1015
01:10:47,263 --> 01:10:49,288
I stood between you and your dream.

1016
01:10:49,933 --> 01:10:51,059
I made you choose.

1017
01:10:52,835 --> 01:10:53,961
That's not love.

1018
01:10:55,838 --> 01:10:56,930
That's selfishness.

1019
01:11:00,276 --> 01:11:01,675
Aunty Ayesha will understand.

1020
01:11:04,047 --> 01:11:05,139
Like me.

1021
01:11:13,056 --> 01:11:16,150
I didn't celebrate
your admission, did I?

1022
01:11:17,327 --> 01:11:18,658
Let's do it now.

1023
01:11:19,896 --> 01:11:20,954
Let's get a beer.

1024
01:11:23,099 --> 01:11:24,157
Actually..

1025
01:11:25,101 --> 01:11:26,762
Let's celebrate you first.

1026
01:11:27,737 --> 01:11:28,829
Why?

1027
01:11:29,072 --> 01:11:31,040
'Cos you found your dream, Gulati.

1028
01:11:31,608 --> 01:11:33,599
For the first time
you look happy working.

1029
01:11:34,978 --> 01:11:36,843
You always looked good in an apron!

1030
01:11:39,749 --> 01:11:40,943
Did you tell your dad?

1031
01:11:46,556 --> 01:11:47,784
I'm following the beat of my heart.

1032
01:11:49,525 --> 01:11:50,583
He'll understand too.

1033
01:11:53,997 --> 01:11:55,123
Chef Ramsay!

1034
01:12:09,979 --> 01:12:11,071
I missed you.

1035
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:15,044
My only friend in the world!

1036
01:13:07,904 --> 01:13:09,599
So the vixen is softening.

1037
01:13:09,939 --> 01:13:11,031
She's bound to.

1038
01:13:11,107 --> 01:13:15,203
If a boy crosses seven seas to
woo her, any girl would melt!

1039
01:13:15,745 --> 01:13:19,044
It's too loose!
- Get her some boobs!

1040
01:13:19,182 --> 01:13:20,672
When are you coming back?

1041
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:21,976
I don't know, Aunty.

1042
01:13:22,285 --> 01:13:25,118
But I will return with Aaliya.

1043
01:13:25,888 --> 01:13:27,719
No, Nads, we're just friends.

1044
01:13:27,957 --> 01:13:29,618
Finally we are un-complicated.

1045
01:13:29,826 --> 01:13:31,293
Love, relationships, hurt..

1046
01:13:32,261 --> 01:13:33,888
..one should leave
these for old-age.

1047
01:13:33,963 --> 01:13:35,089
It's too much.

1048
01:13:35,798 --> 01:13:37,231
Shut up, Cyrus.

1049
01:13:38,935 --> 01:13:41,096
Actually, you're a genius.

1050
01:13:41,771 --> 01:13:42,931
It's simple.

1051
01:13:43,005 --> 01:13:44,939
Love was getting complicated,
so you broke up.

1052
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:46,735
Then you felt all alone..

1053
01:13:46,876 --> 01:13:48,673
..and became friends again.
Perfect! - Exactly.

1054
01:13:48,745 --> 01:13:50,940
And Abhay thinks he's..
- An ATM machine.

1055
01:13:51,581 --> 01:13:53,572
He gets no deposits, you
get to make withdrawals..

1056
01:13:53,916 --> 01:13:56,908
..of his heart, mind or time..

1057
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,280
And the best part?

1058
01:13:58,888 --> 01:14:00,082
Machines don't expect anything back.

1059
01:14:01,858 --> 01:14:03,052
You're being sarcastic, right?

1060
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,151
And this is why you're a genius.

1061
01:14:09,832 --> 01:14:12,164
''I love you.''

1062
01:14:13,836 --> 01:14:17,135
''It's so difficult to
spend days and nights.''

1063
01:14:17,206 --> 01:14:20,767
''There's just one thing
I want to say to you.''

1064
01:14:20,843 --> 01:14:22,743
She's smoking!

1065
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:27,147
Gulati wanted to marry
her when he grew up.

1066
01:14:27,884 --> 01:14:29,579
I was ten, guys.

1067
01:14:29,919 --> 01:14:32,581
Hey, are you coming on
the 10th for my graduation?

1068
01:14:33,623 --> 01:14:35,921
Okay, good news! My new restaurant..

1069
01:14:35,992 --> 01:14:37,118
Our restaurant!

1070
01:14:37,994 --> 01:14:40,588
Our new restaurant
has found an investor!

1071
01:14:40,897 --> 01:14:44,298
Bad news! Meeting's on the 10th.
- Gulati.

1072
01:14:44,567 --> 01:14:46,967
Didn't tell you 'cos I
knew you'd freak out!

1073
01:14:47,203 --> 01:14:50,104
Don't friends fit
into your plans anymore?

1074
01:14:51,174 --> 01:14:52,573
Not fair!

1075
01:14:52,975 --> 01:14:54,704
You used to make
time for me earlier.

1076
01:14:55,011 --> 01:14:56,069
Not fair!

1077
01:14:58,981 --> 01:15:00,346
Yes, I've packed the pickles.

1078
01:15:00,616 --> 01:15:02,083
Hang up and save your money.

1079
01:15:02,251 --> 01:15:04,651
You're arrivingjust a
day before my graduation.

1080
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:05,880
Abhay and Cyrus have a meeting.

1081
01:15:05,955 --> 01:15:07,286
Nadia has to manage the Shack.

1082
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:09,052
Nobody loves me.

1083
01:15:09,892 --> 01:15:11,587
Why couldn't you come earlier?

1084
01:15:12,895 --> 01:15:14,192
I need to discuss
an important thing.

1085
01:15:14,664 --> 01:15:15,722
What happened?

1086
01:15:15,798 --> 01:15:18,096
We'll talk face to face.

1087
01:15:22,038 --> 01:15:23,130
It's kind of big.

1088
01:15:23,206 --> 01:15:26,107
Your ''big'' is usually a ''big bomb''.

1089
01:15:26,709 --> 01:15:28,267
You know I don't like surprises.

1090
01:15:28,711 --> 01:15:29,803
But..
- Aaliya Khan.

1091
01:15:30,146 --> 01:15:31,204
Just a second.

1092
01:15:31,781 --> 01:15:32,873
Gotta run, ma. Bye.

1093
01:15:37,019 --> 01:15:39,010
Nervous?
- Not at all.

1094
01:15:39,222 --> 01:15:40,917
Good, 'cos you can nail it.

1095
01:15:42,024 --> 01:15:43,787
That's what I'm nervous about.

1096
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,893
And now we've reached the
end of another academic year

1097
01:15:48,197 --> 01:15:52,964
Congratulations, class of 2009.
You are all now graduates.

1098
01:15:56,105 --> 01:15:58,596
That's it Ayesha. No more courses.

1099
01:15:58,875 --> 01:16:00,103
I'm fed up of studying.

1100
01:16:00,776 --> 01:16:02,107
Thank God!

1101
01:16:03,145 --> 01:16:06,672
So what's your big surprise?

1102
01:16:07,116 --> 01:16:08,777
You've kept me in
suspense since yesterday.

1103
01:16:09,986 --> 01:16:11,613
Yes, I..

1104
01:16:14,657 --> 01:16:15,783
Gulati!

1105
01:16:19,729 --> 01:16:21,856
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

1106
01:16:23,766 --> 01:16:24,824
Have you told her yet?

1107
01:16:24,967 --> 01:16:26,093
I'm shitting bricks!

1108
01:16:26,802 --> 01:16:27,860
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

1109
01:16:28,137 --> 01:16:30,332
You know how she is.. -Yes.

1110
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:32,669
Don't give her less
credit than she deserves.

1111
01:16:34,010 --> 01:16:35,102
Hey..

1112
01:16:36,212 --> 01:16:37,270
''I'll be right
here waiting for you!''

1113
01:16:38,948 --> 01:16:40,779
Chill! It's just an offer..

1114
01:16:41,183 --> 01:16:42,741
..it's not like
you've signed a contract.

1115
01:16:45,821 --> 01:16:48,688
Al..!
- So that's your big surprise.

1116
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:50,251
Congratulations, aunty.

1117
01:16:50,626 --> 01:16:52,025
Congratulations to you too.

1118
01:16:52,728 --> 01:16:56,926
I'm happier about this
than your graduation.

1119
01:16:57,166 --> 01:17:00,135
I knew it. This
break-up wouldn't last long.

1120
01:17:00,202 --> 01:17:01,328
But how did this happen?

1121
01:17:01,837 --> 01:17:04,135
And please don't
take an eternity again..

1122
01:17:04,707 --> 01:17:05,867
..get married soon.

1123
01:17:07,944 --> 01:17:10,879
Marriage? Where did that come from?

1124
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,009
Even Abhay's managed to move on.

1125
01:17:14,050 --> 01:17:15,142
Aaliya.

1126
01:17:16,686 --> 01:17:18,085
Abhay, tell her that
we're just friends.

1127
01:17:18,154 --> 01:17:19,280
We're just friends.

1128
01:17:21,691 --> 01:17:22,783
Gelato, are you..?

1129
01:17:24,627 --> 01:17:25,719
We're just friends.

1130
01:17:29,098 --> 01:17:31,760
So what was your news?

1131
01:17:33,302 --> 01:17:34,633
What was the surprise?

1132
01:17:37,673 --> 01:17:38,799
Mother, I..

1133
01:17:43,713 --> 01:17:45,977
Promises, commitments, feelings..

1134
01:17:46,282 --> 01:17:48,648
..these things mean nothing to you.

1135
01:17:49,251 --> 01:17:51,845
Don't pretend to ask after
you've signed the contract.

1136
01:17:52,922 --> 01:17:55,948
I don't mind your having dreams..

1137
01:17:57,159 --> 01:18:03,257
..but I mind that our feelings are
nothing but hurdles in your path.

1138
01:18:04,166 --> 01:18:07,795
People don't love you
because you're special Aaliya.

1139
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:12,805
You're special because a few people
in this world love you immensely.

1140
01:18:13,075 --> 01:18:15,202
Sometimes, despite the way you are.

1141
01:18:16,212 --> 01:18:19,841
And today you proved
how foolish they are!

1142
01:18:40,236 --> 01:18:41,635
I didn't want this.

1143
01:18:43,873 --> 01:18:45,306
I just..
- You can't expect everything..

1144
01:18:46,108 --> 01:18:47,666
.. and not expect to get hurt.

1145
01:18:50,713 --> 01:18:51,771
I'm sorry.

1146
01:18:54,183 --> 01:18:55,741
I didn't want to hurt you.

1147
01:18:59,255 --> 01:19:03,692
When we broke up, I refused
to accept it as a possibility.

1148
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,052
I didn't believe you.

1149
01:19:08,097 --> 01:19:09,257
That was my fault.

1150
01:19:10,266 --> 01:19:11,631
You did move on.

1151
01:19:13,803 --> 01:19:14,929
You're lucky you can.

1152
01:19:21,777 --> 01:19:23,745
Goodbye!
- Gulati?

1153
01:19:24,647 --> 01:19:25,705
I'm off.

1154
01:19:43,299 --> 01:19:48,601
Rain.. It will wash it all away.

1155
01:19:50,539 --> 01:19:55,602
Lit up, you'll see it,
a whole new way.

1156
01:19:56,145 --> 01:20:02,709
Slowly, yesterday will ebb away..

1157
01:20:03,119 --> 01:20:10,753
Slowly, making way for a new day.

1158
01:20:11,193 --> 01:20:14,754
Like a roof of sunlight..

1159
01:20:14,830 --> 01:20:18,061
Like a slip-sliding road..

1160
01:20:18,134 --> 01:20:23,094
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.

1161
01:20:24,974 --> 01:20:28,910
Like a roof of sunlight..

1162
01:20:28,978 --> 01:20:32,311
Like a slip-sliding road..

1163
01:20:32,581 --> 01:20:36,574
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.

1164
01:20:36,652 --> 01:20:40,611
''If you believe, sun is shining,
love is lighting your way.''

1165
01:20:55,538 --> 01:20:58,234
I'm sorry. And
thanks for everything.

1166
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:12,949
Drops of realisation
trickle down on me..

1167
01:21:14,857 --> 01:21:20,318
I'm haunted by a
thirst from before..

1168
01:21:21,564 --> 01:21:28,026
But I see new clouds dancing above..

1169
01:21:28,904 --> 01:21:35,275
..kissing my forehead,
with drops of love.

1170
01:21:35,878 --> 01:21:39,211
Letting go.. it is time, I know.

1171
01:21:39,582 --> 01:21:42,779
Seasons have changed in a burst.

1172
01:21:43,018 --> 01:21:48,718
I take a small step,
perhaps my first.

1173
01:21:49,992 --> 01:21:53,587
Like a roof of sunlight..

1174
01:21:53,662 --> 01:21:56,961
Like a slip-sliding road..

1175
01:21:57,132 --> 01:22:02,764
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.

1176
01:22:04,139 --> 01:22:10,271
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.

1177
01:22:11,947 --> 01:22:13,574
I didn't choose my dream, ma..

1178
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:15,910
..it chose me.

1179
01:22:17,653 --> 01:22:19,211
But I will not lose you for it.

1180
01:22:20,990 --> 01:22:22,855
I will walk towards but
only with you beside me..

1181
01:22:23,892 --> 01:22:25,723
And if you aren't
ready to stand by my side..

1182
01:22:25,794 --> 01:22:26,852
..then I'll wait.

1183
01:22:28,297 --> 01:22:29,696
But I won't do this without you.

1184
01:22:31,066 --> 01:22:32,931
I won't leave you alone like dad.

1185
01:22:37,573 --> 01:22:38,767
I am so sorry, Aaliya.

1186
01:22:40,576 --> 01:22:42,203
Your dream wasn't wrong, dear.

1187
01:22:43,512 --> 01:22:47,710
Your means were callous.

1188
01:23:03,666 --> 01:23:07,102
How much dough do you need
for the kitchen expansion?

1189
01:23:07,169 --> 01:23:09,535
Wow, did we make a profit?
- Buzz off.

1190
01:23:09,905 --> 01:23:10,997
Nice.

1191
01:23:11,173 --> 01:23:12,902
Now Cyrus will go on a holiday..

1192
01:23:12,975 --> 01:23:15,773
.. after which you
will expand the kitchen.

1193
01:23:15,844 --> 01:23:17,175
No one will touch this money.

1194
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,640
We're going to
open a new restaurant.

1195
01:23:21,650 --> 01:23:22,742
The Investors loved
our restaurant plan.

1196
01:23:22,818 --> 01:23:23,876
The paperwork will be done tomorrow.

1197
01:23:23,952 --> 01:23:26,147
Are you serious? We got funding?

1198
01:23:26,221 --> 01:23:29,156
Does that mean I can now..
- No, Cy.

1199
01:23:29,325 --> 01:23:30,758
I hate you guys.

1200
01:23:38,267 --> 01:23:39,894
Absolutely.

1201
01:23:39,968 --> 01:23:41,936
It was my idea to open an
Indian restaurant. - Hi, Cy.

1202
01:23:42,004 --> 01:23:44,097
Here is my partner. Gelato Gulati.

1203
01:23:44,173 --> 01:23:46,198
Congratulations, man!

1204
01:23:46,275 --> 01:23:48,209
Houseful on the first
day itself. - Thanks, man.

1205
01:23:48,277 --> 01:23:49,608
No free drinks.

1206
01:24:00,689 --> 01:24:02,122
Abhay.

1207
01:24:06,795 --> 01:24:07,887
Nice place.

1208
01:24:09,698 --> 01:24:14,226
Abhay, had I known
you're so talented..

1209
01:24:14,837 --> 01:24:17,829
..I'd have thrown you out years ago.

1210
01:24:20,642 --> 01:24:21,768
I'm sorry, Papa.

1211
01:24:23,112 --> 01:24:28,982
I didn't tell you earlier
'cos even I didn't know..

1212
01:24:30,185 --> 01:24:34,918
Abhay, my dream wasn't that
you'll learn to manage my theatre..

1213
01:24:36,158 --> 01:24:38,149
..but that you'll
learn to manage your life.

1214
01:24:39,328 --> 01:24:40,625
My dream's come true.

1215
01:24:44,133 --> 01:24:45,600
You're finally on your feet..

1216
01:24:47,569 --> 01:24:48,763
..earning as well.

1217
01:24:49,772 --> 01:24:52,240
So you and Aaliya..

1218
01:24:52,307 --> 01:24:53,604
No, Papa.

1219
01:24:54,777 --> 01:24:56,005
We won't discuss that.

1220
01:24:57,146 --> 01:24:58,738
That topic is closed, please.

1221
01:24:59,915 --> 01:25:02,782
Fine, let's talk
about something else.

1222
01:25:04,353 --> 01:25:06,947
Why.. don't you get married?

1223
01:25:12,961 --> 01:25:14,223
She's cute.

1224
01:25:14,296 --> 01:25:16,787
And she'll turn eighteen soon.

1225
01:25:18,233 --> 01:25:23,330
Happiness hung from
a branch so elusive..

1226
01:25:25,274 --> 01:25:30,712
..but I leaped and
caught its fragrance.

1227
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:38,217
So fragile, but we
inevitably slipped..

1228
01:25:39,288 --> 01:25:45,284
..but I will heal, I
will rewrite my script!

1229
01:25:46,328 --> 01:25:53,234
I can see the shore,
I see the light..

1230
01:25:53,602 --> 01:25:58,938
..new stars wink at me from the sky!

1231
01:26:04,313 --> 01:26:05,940
The flight's day after tomorrow.

1232
01:26:06,315 --> 01:26:07,782
Next Monday flight to Gold Coast.

1233
01:26:10,319 --> 01:26:15,086
By the time I realized
that my parents are right..

1234
01:26:17,226 --> 01:26:22,186
..my own daughter was standing in
front of me telling me I was wrong!

1235
01:26:25,334 --> 01:26:29,327
I was trying to protect you from
making the mistakes I had made.

1236
01:26:31,206 --> 01:26:35,267
But I forgot.. you're not like me.

1237
01:26:36,845 --> 01:26:37,869
You're much stronger.

1238
01:26:41,049 --> 01:26:42,311
Still have a knack for dialogues!

1239
01:26:43,018 --> 01:26:44,110
Why'd you quit acting?

1240
01:26:46,588 --> 01:26:47,748
Go back, Aaliya.

1241
01:26:48,056 --> 01:26:49,148
Follow your heart.

1242
01:26:53,729 --> 01:26:57,096
Like a roof of sunlight..

1243
01:26:57,165 --> 01:27:00,692
Like a slip-sliding road..

1244
01:27:00,769 --> 01:27:05,866
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.

1245
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:11,177
Like a roof of sunlight..

1246
01:27:11,246 --> 01:27:14,807
Like a slip-sliding road..

1247
01:27:14,883 --> 01:27:20,082
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.

1248
01:27:21,857 --> 01:27:25,315
Like a roof of sunlight..

1249
01:27:25,594 --> 01:27:28,961
Like a slip-sliding road..

1250
01:27:28,997 --> 01:27:33,900
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.

1251
01:27:36,004 --> 01:27:39,531
Like a roof of sunlight..

1252
01:27:39,608 --> 01:27:42,975
Like a slip-sliding road..

1253
01:27:43,045 --> 01:27:47,744
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.

1254
01:27:50,052 --> 01:27:53,647
Like a roof of sunlight..

1255
01:27:53,722 --> 01:27:57,123
Like a slip-sliding road..

1256
01:27:57,192 --> 01:28:03,791
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.

1257
01:28:19,681 --> 01:28:20,773
Come on, Aunt Pammi.

1258
01:28:21,283 --> 01:28:23,717
You know I'm not
interested in marriage.

1259
01:28:24,252 --> 01:28:25,913
So why should I meet any more girls?

1260
01:28:25,988 --> 01:28:27,615
'Cos that's the only way!

1261
01:28:27,889 --> 01:28:32,155
Just meet them, then say 'no'!

1262
01:28:32,828 --> 01:28:33,920
Oh, please..

1263
01:28:34,696 --> 01:28:35,822
Is this seat taken?

1264
01:28:36,898 --> 01:28:37,922
Are you meeting a girl?

1265
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:40,031
A beautiful babe.

1266
01:28:40,268 --> 01:28:42,168
Can I go now?
- Don't ever call me that.

1267
01:28:43,138 --> 01:28:45,129
She sounds like a vixen too.

1268
01:28:46,008 --> 01:28:47,066
Bye aunty!

1269
01:28:47,275 --> 01:28:50,142
I can't believe the
restaurant's completed a year.

1270
01:28:50,679 --> 01:28:53,011
Happy anniversary.
- Yes, whatever.

1271
01:28:53,882 --> 01:28:56,646
Everything began in
this shack. Thanks..

1272
01:28:56,985 --> 01:28:59,783
I owe you guys everything, or I'd
still be rotting at the taxi stand..

1273
01:28:59,855 --> 01:29:01,948
..and Cyrus would be
rotting in a beer can.

1274
01:29:02,624 --> 01:29:03,682
We're even!

1275
01:29:03,725 --> 01:29:05,693
No one owes shit!

1276
01:29:05,961 --> 01:29:07,053
A toast..!

1277
01:29:10,065 --> 01:29:11,191
To Cyrus..!

1278
01:29:11,833 --> 01:29:13,994
Who achieved nothing
in life, till today!

1279
01:29:15,237 --> 01:29:18,035
This restaurant is my first..
- And sole!

1280
01:29:19,074 --> 01:29:21,235
And soul milestone.

1281
01:29:21,777 --> 01:29:23,005
Well done, Cyrus.

1282
01:29:23,245 --> 01:29:24,337
Cheers!

1283
01:29:26,948 --> 01:29:28,074
What's a 'soul'?

1284
01:29:29,751 --> 01:29:31,013
What you can only hope for.

1285
01:29:40,996 --> 01:29:42,896
Surprise!
- Surprise!

1286
01:29:43,632 --> 01:29:44,997
She's shooting a film here.

1287
01:29:45,634 --> 01:29:46,726
Aunty Ayesha agreed.

1288
01:29:50,605 --> 01:29:52,300
Why dredge up what's over..
- Just a minute.

1289
01:29:52,841 --> 01:29:54,706
Have you been on a single
date after your break-up?

1290
01:29:58,847 --> 01:30:00,246
This isn't over yet.

1291
01:30:02,084 --> 01:30:03,176
Hi.

1292
01:30:03,552 --> 01:30:04,712
Hey.

1293
01:30:10,192 --> 01:30:13,059
I told Nads that maybe I
shouldn't.. - It's fine.

1294
01:30:18,033 --> 01:30:19,125
How are you?

1295
01:30:20,135 --> 01:30:21,193
I'm good.

1296
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,132
Thank you.

1297
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:33,605
Let's end this awkwardness,
I'm not good at it.

1298
01:30:33,648 --> 01:30:36,048
I just came to say..
- Al, it's fine.

1299
01:30:36,118 --> 01:30:37,210
No, let me say it.

1300
01:30:37,285 --> 01:30:38,912
I just came to say that..
- Al, chill.

1301
01:30:39,654 --> 01:30:40,712
I'm glad you're here.

1302
01:30:40,789 --> 01:30:41,881
Gulati, I need to say this!

1303
01:30:42,224 --> 01:30:44,590
I just want to say that
I'm really happy for you..

1304
01:30:44,659 --> 01:30:46,149
I'm very proud of you and..

1305
01:30:48,663 --> 01:30:49,755
..I'm sorry.

1306
01:30:52,734 --> 01:30:53,996
I'm really very sorry.

1307
01:30:55,537 --> 01:30:56,765
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1308
01:30:59,674 --> 01:31:01,039
So how many
restaurants do you own now?

1309
01:31:01,610 --> 01:31:02,736
Two and a half!

1310
01:31:03,545 --> 01:31:05,672
Two in Gold Coast and
one in papa's theatre.

1311
01:31:06,948 --> 01:31:08,006
Wow!

1312
01:31:08,650 --> 01:31:09,912
So you finally told him.

1313
01:31:10,819 --> 01:31:12,047
He must be so proud of you.

1314
01:31:14,589 --> 01:31:17,581
Last year's been so hectic..
- One year and forty days!

1315
01:31:19,728 --> 01:31:20,956
When did your memory improve?

1316
01:31:21,263 --> 01:31:23,629
I remember everything.
- Really?

1317
01:31:25,133 --> 01:31:26,828
I was thinking on the flight..

1318
01:31:27,235 --> 01:31:29,999
..when we first met in class..
- In the theatre.

1319
01:31:30,338 --> 01:31:33,739
Who would've imagined that we
would kiss while watching DDLJ

1320
01:31:33,809 --> 01:31:34,867
Kuch Kuch Hota Hai.

1321
01:31:34,943 --> 01:31:36,308
And then date for eight years.

1322
01:31:36,645 --> 01:31:37,703
Eight years and nine months.

1323
01:31:37,879 --> 01:31:40,677
Thanks for shitting on my nostalgia!

1324
01:31:42,184 --> 01:31:43,845
We were watching Kuch Kuch Hota Hai.

1325
01:31:45,187 --> 01:31:46,984
In fact, for the third time.

1326
01:31:48,190 --> 01:31:49,748
We had memorized the dialogues..

1327
01:31:49,825 --> 01:31:51,884
..but you were saying
them with all your heart.

1328
01:31:52,694 --> 01:31:54,252
While Shahrukh's
monologues kept going..

1329
01:31:54,763 --> 01:31:57,129
.. your horrific
impersonation got scarier.

1330
01:32:00,001 --> 01:32:01,935
I had a thumping headache!

1331
01:32:02,804 --> 01:32:04,669
But I kept saying them dialogues..

1332
01:32:04,739 --> 01:32:08,140
..so you wouldn't notice
that I was only watching you!

1333
01:32:10,312 --> 01:32:12,177
And your perfume
was driving me wild.

1334
01:32:14,583 --> 01:32:15,845
Maybe that caused the headache.

1335
01:32:17,319 --> 01:32:18,650
I think it was Lily.

1336
01:32:20,255 --> 01:32:22,587
To end your blabbering,
I suggested going home..

1337
01:32:22,657 --> 01:32:24,147
..and watching some
more Shahrukh films.

1338
01:32:25,894 --> 01:32:27,225
And something happened to you.

1339
01:32:29,664 --> 01:32:32,292
You just leaned over
and kissed me, and said..

1340
01:32:32,734 --> 01:32:37,569
'No one I know has
endured so much pain for me!'

1341
01:32:44,813 --> 01:32:45,905
Lavender!

1342
01:32:47,582 --> 01:32:48,947
The perfume was lavender.

1343
01:32:55,223 --> 01:32:56,713
Nice place, Gulati.

1344
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,861
If you hadn't come here I'd
still be decaying in Delhi!

1345
01:33:02,097 --> 01:33:03,792
I would've never dared to step out.

1346
01:33:05,567 --> 01:33:07,091
So.. thank you.

1347
01:33:08,970 --> 01:33:11,996
I came here to look for you..
and found myself.

1348
01:33:13,141 --> 01:33:14,267
Say that dialogue again!

1349
01:33:21,149 --> 01:33:23,310
Seeing anyone?
- Yes.

1350
01:33:24,019 --> 01:33:25,281
Mr. Kunzru's daughter.

1351
01:33:26,087 --> 01:33:27,952
Mr. Agarwal's niece from New York.

1352
01:33:28,189 --> 01:33:30,555
Mrs. Srivastav's
''almost legal'' niece.

1353
01:33:31,593 --> 01:33:34,153
Preeti's gynecologist's
neighbor's step-daughter..

1354
01:33:34,229 --> 01:33:36,891
..who is also a gynecologist.

1355
01:33:37,098 --> 01:33:38,690
And both daughters of Mr. Wanchoo!

1356
01:33:40,735 --> 01:33:41,827
Don't ask, Al.

1357
01:33:42,570 --> 01:33:44,231
I'm going to India
tomorrow for Preeti's baby shower.

1358
01:33:44,606 --> 01:33:47,040
They're going to pounce on me
like a pack of hungry wolves!

1359
01:33:47,242 --> 01:33:49,039
Preeti's preggers?
- Don't start.

1360
01:33:49,644 --> 01:33:53,705
No. That's.. great!

1361
01:33:57,886 --> 01:33:58,978
What happened?

1362
01:34:02,190 --> 01:34:03,748
Don't resist it, Gulati.

1363
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,086
Resist what?

1364
01:34:06,661 --> 01:34:07,753
Marriage.

1365
01:34:08,797 --> 01:34:10,662
Any girl would be
lucky to get your love.

1366
01:34:14,602 --> 01:34:15,694
And you?

1367
01:34:17,038 --> 01:34:18,062
Are you happy?

1368
01:34:20,208 --> 01:34:21,766
I am learning to be 'happy'.

1369
01:34:27,015 --> 01:34:28,607
You got what you wanted.

1370
01:34:30,118 --> 01:34:31,176
Yes, but..

1371
01:34:32,988 --> 01:34:34,956
Breaking things comes
easily to me, Gulati.

1372
01:34:37,792 --> 01:34:39,225
I nearly lost my mom as well.

1373
01:34:41,763 --> 01:34:43,754
All my life I
wanted to be like her..

1374
01:34:44,866 --> 01:34:46,197
..but turned out
exactly like my dad!

1375
01:34:50,205 --> 01:34:51,638
I even broke us!

1376
01:35:00,181 --> 01:35:01,648
Maybe.. I'm not meant for love.

1377
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,274
'I don't want to deal
with your problems, Abhay.'

1378
01:35:28,743 --> 01:35:30,904
'This is it, I'm
breaking up with you.'

1379
01:35:31,379 --> 01:35:33,176
'Ayesha, even Abhay
has managed to move on.'

1380
01:35:33,982 --> 01:35:37,941
' When we broke up, I refused
to accept it as a possibility.'

1381
01:35:39,587 --> 01:35:42,988
'I didn't believe you.
That was my mistake.'

1382
01:35:44,926 --> 01:35:46,223
'Don't resist it, Gulati.'

1383
01:35:46,995 --> 01:35:49,190
'Resist what?
- Marriage.'

1384
01:35:50,131 --> 01:35:52,031
'Breaking things comes easily to me.

1385
01:35:53,068 --> 01:35:54,228
'I even broke us.'

1386
01:35:55,336 --> 01:35:56,826
'Maybe I'm not meant for love.'

1387
01:36:08,049 --> 01:36:09,744
I thought that I understood love.

1388
01:36:12,687 --> 01:36:13,779
But now..

1389
01:36:17,025 --> 01:36:18,151
I don't know anything.

1390
01:36:30,905 --> 01:36:32,065
I don't know what love is.

1391
01:36:37,779 --> 01:36:39,713
If you don't take
her off your wall..

1392
01:36:40,081 --> 01:36:41,708
..how will you get
her out of your heart?

1393
01:36:43,685 --> 01:36:46,313
The girl you eventually marry..
- I can't fall in love again!

1394
01:36:47,689 --> 01:36:54,185
These damn Bollywood remakes of
Devdas have ruined children's minds!

1395
01:36:54,896 --> 01:36:56,864
'Alas! She dumped me!'

1396
01:36:57,298 --> 01:37:01,166
'I dedicate my life to
scuba diving in cheap whiskey!'

1397
01:37:02,170 --> 01:37:03,967
Nothing sexy about that guy!

1398
01:37:05,073 --> 01:37:07,667
Aunty, I am not like you.
- That's the problem.

1399
01:37:11,179 --> 01:37:15,013
What if one was to leap from here?

1400
01:37:17,118 --> 01:37:20,110
They'd risk a few fractures,
brain hemorrhage and..

1401
01:37:20,188 --> 01:37:21,951
And that's the
difference between you and me,

1402
01:37:22,657 --> 01:37:24,284
I married thrice.

1403
01:37:25,093 --> 01:37:27,220
I broke my head,
suffered fractures..

1404
01:37:27,662 --> 01:37:29,687
..survived brain hemorrhage as well.

1405
01:37:30,832 --> 01:37:34,199
And I'm ready to leap again!

1406
01:37:34,369 --> 01:37:35,734
Why?

1407
01:37:36,004 --> 01:37:38,268
Because no matter how much it hurt..

1408
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:40,870
..I never let myself be scared.

1409
01:37:41,709 --> 01:37:43,643
You have to be fearless, Abhay.

1410
01:37:44,879 --> 01:37:48,610
Or you'll end up sharing other's
happiness, in their weddings.

1411
01:37:50,251 --> 01:37:52,651
Love is inside you, dear.

1412
01:37:53,221 --> 01:37:55,917
Take your heart out of it's
shock-proof padding..

1413
01:37:55,990 --> 01:37:57,855
..and let it do it's job!

1414
01:37:58,593 --> 01:38:01,721
These tiny shocks can't hurt it!

1415
01:38:02,564 --> 01:38:04,725
And if you wanted to play so safe..

1416
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:06,895
..why'd you fall in
love even the first time?

1417
01:38:10,705 --> 01:38:11,831
You kids..

1418
01:38:12,006 --> 01:38:16,204
..you can't want everything and
expect to not get a little hurt!

1419
01:38:37,865 --> 01:38:43,531
''It's drizzling in my thoughts..
Everything will be washed.''

1420
01:38:44,906 --> 01:38:50,003
''There will be a new ray of hope.''

1421
01:38:50,678 --> 01:38:57,049
''All the painful
memories will flow away.''

1422
01:38:57,685 --> 01:39:05,251
''There will be a new destination.
Let's go.''

1423
01:39:11,165 --> 01:39:12,996
Papa.
- Yes?

1424
01:39:14,302 --> 01:39:15,564
What?

1425
01:39:16,037 --> 01:39:17,265
Have you lost it?

1426
01:39:17,672 --> 01:39:19,264
Cy, keep it down.
You're on a film set!

1427
01:39:19,707 --> 01:39:21,072
What about me and our business?

1428
01:39:21,309 --> 01:39:23,834
We're discussing two more
restaurants with the investors.

1429
01:39:24,012 --> 01:39:26,276
I can't believe I'm
the responsible one here.

1430
01:39:26,614 --> 01:39:28,104
I get to behave like this, not you.

1431
01:39:28,650 --> 01:39:29,708
Abhay's getting married.

1432
01:39:30,018 --> 01:39:31,076
What?

1433
01:39:33,721 --> 01:39:34,847
Wow.

1434
01:39:35,323 --> 01:39:37,052
'Wow'? That's it?

1435
01:39:37,125 --> 01:39:39,753
I can't buy my Porsche 'cos of you.

1436
01:39:40,295 --> 01:39:41,660
Yeah, whatever.

1437
01:39:42,697 --> 01:39:45,188
Congratulations.. loser!

1438
01:39:46,601 --> 01:39:48,034
He told you first?

1439
01:39:49,737 --> 01:39:50,931
He didn't even call me.

1440
01:39:51,205 --> 01:39:53,298
And you're upset about that?

1441
01:39:54,842 --> 01:40:00,246
Yes, I told him to get married,
but.. he didn't tell me?

1442
01:40:10,291 --> 01:40:11,724
Why's he not answering?

1443
01:40:12,327 --> 01:40:13,624
Chicks are weird.

1444
01:40:14,162 --> 01:40:18,189
I hope the girl's a
voluptuous North Indian babe!

1445
01:40:18,566 --> 01:40:21,296
Not Abhay's type.
- Cy was talking about himself.

1446
01:40:21,936 --> 01:40:24,666
I can't believe he's getting
married. - And he didn't tell me!

1447
01:40:24,739 --> 01:40:27,105
Why? After all he's just marrying!

1448
01:40:27,241 --> 01:40:28,708
But, Ayesha, he didn't even tell me.

1449
01:40:28,876 --> 01:40:31,106
He will tell you. He must be busy.

1450
01:40:31,713 --> 01:40:32,805
Why?

1451
01:40:33,881 --> 01:40:35,348
What's the point in worrying now?

1452
01:40:35,750 --> 01:40:37,081
I'm not worried.

1453
01:40:37,352 --> 01:40:38,546
I'm happy for him.

1454
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:39,948
But he could've called me.

1455
01:40:40,688 --> 01:40:42,087
But you broke up with him.

1456
01:40:42,223 --> 01:40:44,123
So?
- So he's moved on.

1457
01:40:44,559 --> 01:40:46,026
Not to another planet.

1458
01:40:47,662 --> 01:40:48,754
What the hell..!

1459
01:40:56,304 --> 01:40:58,738
Are you alright?
- Yes.

1460
01:40:58,873 --> 01:41:00,204
Are you sure?
- Are you deaf?

1461
01:41:00,742 --> 01:41:02,539
No, just rich and single.

1462
01:41:02,677 --> 01:41:03,769
Al..

1463
01:41:03,845 --> 01:41:05,278
I'm fine, okay!

1464
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:06,945
No, you're in love with Abhay.

1465
01:41:18,793 --> 01:41:21,694
Ladies and gentleman, the
flight from Gold Coast to Delhi..

1466
01:41:21,763 --> 01:41:23,025
..will be now ready for boarding.

1467
01:41:23,097 --> 01:41:24,155
What will you do after going there?

1468
01:41:24,232 --> 01:41:25,324
I don't know.

1469
01:41:25,733 --> 01:41:27,257
You broke up with him.
- I know.

1470
01:41:27,735 --> 01:41:29,760
You think..
- I don't know.

1471
01:41:30,271 --> 01:41:32,865
Isn't it a little too late?
- No.

1472
01:41:34,909 --> 01:41:36,706
Maybe. I don't know.

1473
01:41:36,911 --> 01:41:37,935
Just shut up.

1474
01:41:39,213 --> 01:41:40,612
Chicks are weird.

1475
01:41:43,551 --> 01:41:45,178
Aaliya, please relax.

1476
01:41:45,553 --> 01:41:46,781
He's not answering his phone.

1477
01:41:46,854 --> 01:41:48,845
Obviously, he's
getting married today.

1478
01:41:49,056 --> 01:41:51,115
Did you try his residence number?

1479
01:42:01,736 --> 01:42:04,204
So loose?

1480
01:42:04,772 --> 01:42:06,137
Is this a blouse or a jacket?

1481
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:11,168
I'm very high.

1482
01:42:12,246 --> 01:42:13,907
Mummy, butter chicken!

1483
01:42:13,981 --> 01:42:15,846
Why're there such few lights?

1484
01:42:15,917 --> 01:42:17,179
I've put three thousand already.

1485
01:42:17,251 --> 01:42:19,651
So double that! Where's Abhay?

1486
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:20,914
There's no place left.

1487
01:42:21,055 --> 01:42:22,613
Put them up on my head.

1488
01:42:23,658 --> 01:42:25,853
Pick up, Pick up.. please pick up.

1489
01:42:26,327 --> 01:42:28,557
They must've booked the
honeymoon suite by now.

1490
01:42:35,570 --> 01:42:36,662
Goal!

1491
01:42:38,039 --> 01:42:40,166
Hi, Aaliya.
- Isn't that Abhay's ex?

1492
01:42:40,241 --> 01:42:41,503
Shh.. quiet!

1493
01:42:44,912 --> 01:42:46,038
Aaliya?

1494
01:42:49,550 --> 01:42:50,608
Uncle, where's Abhay?

1495
01:42:50,685 --> 01:42:51,777
He must be upstairs..

1496
01:42:54,722 --> 01:42:56,121
The vixen cometh!
- Where's Abhay?

1497
01:42:56,624 --> 01:42:58,854
Counting the last
moments of bliss in his room.

1498
01:43:01,229 --> 01:43:02,526
Aaliya..!

1499
01:43:05,066 --> 01:43:06,158
What are you doing?

1500
01:43:06,234 --> 01:43:07,531
Look at this!

1501
01:43:08,035 --> 01:43:09,127
What did I tell you?

1502
01:43:09,570 --> 01:43:10,935
But it isn't shiny, sir.

1503
01:43:11,005 --> 01:43:12,734
No, it's a damn tubelight.
- What?

1504
01:43:13,574 --> 01:43:14,700
Leave it.

1505
01:43:14,775 --> 01:43:15,833
But, ma'am, the wedding..

1506
01:43:15,910 --> 01:43:16,968
Drop it..

1507
01:43:17,044 --> 01:43:18,272
..or should I use
your scissors on you?

1508
01:43:21,949 --> 01:43:23,007
Abhay, listen..

1509
01:43:24,819 --> 01:43:26,582
God, I look like shit!

1510
01:43:26,787 --> 01:43:27,913
So do I.

1511
01:43:34,695 --> 01:43:36,128
Al..
- Shhh!

1512
01:43:41,602 --> 01:43:42,660
Abhay Gulati.

1513
01:43:43,771 --> 01:43:44,829
I love you.

1514
01:43:46,841 --> 01:43:48,536
Your grandma gave you this ring..

1515
01:43:48,609 --> 01:43:49,837
..for your wife.

1516
01:43:50,611 --> 01:43:52,135
For years it was meant for me.

1517
01:43:52,747 --> 01:43:54,840
And I ruined it with
much effort and diligence..

1518
01:43:54,916 --> 01:43:56,042
..with a little help from you.

1519
01:43:56,117 --> 01:43:57,744
But that's a minor technicality.

1520
01:43:57,818 --> 01:43:59,149
You were lost, I was immature..

1521
01:43:59,687 --> 01:44:00,813
But the point is that..

1522
01:44:00,888 --> 01:44:04,688
..the girl you're going to marry must
be a intelligent, mature person..

1523
01:44:04,759 --> 01:44:06,624
She has to be, 'cos
she's marrying you.

1524
01:44:06,894 --> 01:44:08,919
And I'm a crazy,
immature, stupid, fool..

1525
01:44:09,163 --> 01:44:10,721
..I have to be, for losing you.

1526
01:44:10,865 --> 01:44:13,197
But I've always loved
you and I always will..

1527
01:44:13,267 --> 01:44:15,201
..even if marry this girl,
who you don't even know.

1528
01:44:15,269 --> 01:44:16,634
But anyway the point is..

1529
01:44:16,938 --> 01:44:20,237
..even for a second, if you
still think you have a choice..

1530
01:44:23,044 --> 01:44:24,102
..then please..

1531
01:44:25,246 --> 01:44:26,543
..choose me.

1532
01:44:27,982 --> 01:44:29,074
Please.

1533
01:44:31,686 --> 01:44:32,812
Why?

1534
01:44:34,589 --> 01:44:37,319
'Cos you haven't watched Mr.
India twenty times with that girl.

1535
01:44:37,592 --> 01:44:40,026
She doesn't know how awfully you
bray when you sing in the loo.

1536
01:44:40,161 --> 01:44:42,857
How you know the name of every
kid on every traffic signal..

1537
01:44:42,930 --> 01:44:44,261
..even though they think you're '

1538
01:44:44,632 --> 01:44:47,123
And.. I don't have any other reason.

1539
01:44:50,938 --> 01:44:52,132
I've made up my mind, Al.

1540
01:44:55,009 --> 01:44:57,204
Is this marriage or vengeance?

1541
01:44:59,347 --> 01:45:01,042
We spent almost ten years together..

1542
01:45:03,751 --> 01:45:06,652
And were friends for
ten years before that!

1543
01:45:07,054 --> 01:45:08,146
Exactly.

1544
01:45:08,889 --> 01:45:09,947
Really?

1545
01:45:10,758 --> 01:45:13,318
Just because I turned
out to be a total moron..

1546
01:45:14,061 --> 01:45:16,222
..you'll marry any random girl?

1547
01:45:16,297 --> 01:45:17,594
She's not random.

1548
01:45:17,665 --> 01:45:19,030
Yes, she is. Who is this..

1549
01:45:20,167 --> 01:45:21,225
..Aaliya?

1550
01:45:24,605 --> 01:45:25,902
You're marrying me?

1551
01:45:27,074 --> 01:45:28,132
It's a typo!

1552
01:45:28,843 --> 01:45:30,640
No, look! It says 'Aaliya'..

1553
01:45:30,878 --> 01:45:32,004
Al..!

1554
01:45:33,981 --> 01:45:36,040
I don't need a reason to marry you.

1555
01:45:37,652 --> 01:45:40,780
I promised you no matter how..

1556
01:45:40,988 --> 01:45:45,550
..stupid, immature, mind-blowingly
moronically you behave..

1557
01:45:47,628 --> 01:45:48,925
..I won't let go.

1558
01:45:52,767 --> 01:45:54,098
How could the one who
pushed me to be brave..

1559
01:45:55,002 --> 01:45:56,128
..boldly took risks..

1560
01:45:57,571 --> 01:45:59,300
..was the 'star in her own life'..

1561
01:46:01,208 --> 01:46:02,937
..be afraid of herself today?

1562
01:46:06,347 --> 01:46:07,974
You taught me to be fearless, Al.

1563
01:46:09,183 --> 01:46:10,650
You can't give up!

1564
01:46:11,352 --> 01:46:12,683
You made us stronger.

1565
01:46:16,090 --> 01:46:17,648
And you're not like your dad..

1566
01:46:18,592 --> 01:46:19,854
.. or you wouldn't be here today.

1567
01:46:22,129 --> 01:46:23,619
You are meant for love!

1568
01:46:34,175 --> 01:46:35,301
By the way..

1569
01:46:36,343 --> 01:46:39,073
..the 'Thread
Maintenance Department' has quit!

1570
01:46:42,550 --> 01:46:43,744
I'm into spinning tops now.

1571
01:46:44,151 --> 01:46:45,778
The suckers stay on the ground!

1572
01:46:53,127 --> 01:46:54,185
Are you sure?

1573
01:46:54,261 --> 01:46:55,990
Al.

1574
01:46:56,197 --> 01:46:57,323
Eighteen years and nine months!

1575
01:46:57,598 --> 01:46:59,122
For the love of God, yes.

1576
01:47:00,267 --> 01:47:01,757
Then why are we getting married?

1577
01:47:02,570 --> 01:47:03,662
Excellent point.

1578
01:47:04,038 --> 01:47:06,006
We were married in a way!

1579
01:47:06,807 --> 01:47:08,866
When two people are together
for so long, it's a marriage!

1580
01:47:09,143 --> 01:47:10,974
This is pointless!
- Exactly.

1581
01:47:11,045 --> 01:47:12,842
'Cos here's a perfectly good thing
- Love.

1582
01:47:12,913 --> 01:47:14,312
Now let's destroy it,
piece by piece.

1583
01:47:14,582 --> 01:47:17,915
'Cos if we don't get
married Scandal! ! !

1584
01:47:17,985 --> 01:47:21,113
Just for a piece of paper that'll
tell us what we already know.

1585
01:47:21,188 --> 01:47:23,349
That we love each other.
- Exactly.

1586
01:47:24,191 --> 01:47:26,887
Or I wouldn't be spending our
honeymoon catering on your set!

1587
01:47:27,061 --> 01:47:28,153
See, true love.

1588
01:47:28,195 --> 01:47:30,060
This is not sin!

1589
01:47:30,131 --> 01:47:32,929
So please don't call
our kids weird names!

1590
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,763
What? Hang on.
- But we won't have any kids.

1591
01:47:34,835 --> 01:47:36,803
Exactly..
- We will adopt puppies.

1592
01:47:37,071 --> 01:47:38,060
Then why didn't we?

1593
01:47:38,139 --> 01:47:39,629
I hate you, it's all your fault.

1594
01:47:39,707 --> 01:47:42,676
Al, breathe in, breathe out!
- I hate you.

1595
01:47:42,910 --> 01:47:44,104
I know. I love you.

1596
01:47:44,645 --> 01:47:45,873
I hate this guy.

1597
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:47,645
Who the hell are you?

1598
01:47:47,715 --> 01:47:48,807
He's our doctor.

1599
01:47:48,949 --> 01:47:50,007
Don't touch me!

1600
01:47:50,084 --> 01:47:51,244
How else will he do the delivery?

1601
01:47:51,318 --> 01:47:52,615
I'm talking about you.

1602
01:47:52,653 --> 01:47:53,950
Please get this thing out of her.

1603
01:47:54,955 --> 01:47:56,047
Let's do it again.

1604
01:47:57,792 --> 01:47:59,191
I don't think I can
go through the trauma

1605
01:47:59,794 --> 01:48:02,228
What shit! I endured the trauma.

1606
01:48:02,830 --> 01:48:03,922
Come on.

1607
01:48:04,565 --> 01:48:05,691
No.

1608
01:48:07,101 --> 01:48:09,194
Sarah, mom is leaving you now, okay?

1609
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:12,000
Like you left daddy.

1610
01:48:12,106 --> 01:48:13,198
What?

1611
01:48:15,109 --> 01:48:17,907
Sarah, mom loves dad so much..

1612
01:48:17,978 --> 01:48:20,708
..that she came back from
Australia to be with him.

1613
01:48:20,948 --> 01:48:22,711
After the break up.

1614
01:48:24,185 --> 01:48:25,652
It was just a little break.

1615
01:48:26,821 --> 01:48:28,254
So what does a 'little
break' mean Shah Rukh?

1616
01:48:28,322 --> 01:48:29,721
Oh shut up, Sunita!

1617
01:48:44,071 --> 01:48:48,770
And finally a whiff of fresh air..

1618
01:48:51,679 --> 01:48:56,673
.. as our bound arms
stretch themselves.

1619
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:03,617
My heart wants to hum..

1620
01:49:03,891 --> 01:49:05,859
While he wants to sing..

1621
01:49:06,126 --> 01:49:09,687
I smile, he giggles..

1622
01:49:10,798 --> 01:49:14,029
.. powerless
against this crazy whim.

1623
01:49:14,768 --> 01:49:20,104
Distances are important too.

1624
01:49:20,975 --> 01:49:23,808
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

1625
01:49:24,144 --> 01:49:29,047
Distances are important too.

1626
01:49:30,150 --> 01:49:36,020
Distances are important too.

1627
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:39,090
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

1628
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:45,590
Distances are important too.

1629
01:49:49,169 --> 01:49:54,072
Such intimacy sows
seeds of distances..

1630
01:49:56,777 --> 01:50:01,714
.. don't be fooled,
these waters are not sweet.

1631
01:50:03,817 --> 01:50:04,943
Look, but don't touch; its fire..

1632
01:50:05,152 --> 01:50:07,552
..just watch it shimmer from afar..

1633
01:50:07,721 --> 01:50:15,719
..any closer and you could burn..

1634
01:50:15,996 --> 01:50:19,762
..powerless against this crazy whim.

1635
01:50:20,067 --> 01:50:25,767
Distances are important too.

1636
01:50:26,273 --> 01:50:29,106
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

1637
01:50:29,610 --> 01:50:35,105
Distances are important too.

1638
01:50:35,349 --> 01:50:40,616
Distances are important too.

1639
01:50:41,889 --> 01:50:44,255
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

1640
01:50:44,792 --> 01:50:50,753
Distances are important too.

1641
01:50:54,668 --> 01:51:04,168
I am rain and sunshine..

1642
01:51:04,244 --> 01:51:10,740
And he is a big bore.

1643
01:51:12,286 --> 01:51:14,686
Both rain but not together.

1644
01:51:14,855 --> 01:51:18,552
Life's easy with some distance.

1645
01:51:18,692 --> 01:51:22,253
We have our different worlds.

1646
01:51:23,163 --> 01:51:26,792
We are powerless
against this crazy whim.

1647
01:51:59,867 --> 01:52:05,169
Distances are important too.

1648
01:52:06,073 --> 01:52:08,769
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

1649
01:52:09,209 --> 01:52:14,203
Distances are important too.

1650
01:52:15,182 --> 01:52:20,620
Distances are important too.

1651
01:52:21,789 --> 01:52:24,053
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

1652
01:52:24,691 --> 01:52:30,323
Distances are important too.

Okay that means you are somewhere
nearby, thank you so much.

39
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:22,959

40
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:25,002
Coincidently he was in our area.

00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,198
Don't worry, everything will be okay.

42
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:31,346

Thank you doctor, come fast.

46
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:03,107
Come"" this way.

47
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:06,811
Is it attack?
- I'm not sure.

48
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:08,175
But I have given him pills.

49
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:09,978
Did you give the injection?
- No.

50
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,717
Doctor, is it a heart attack?

51
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:21,391
No, just a muscular pain.

52
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,993
Sometime physical stress
can also lead to a heart attack.

53
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:29,661
So should I take him to hospital.

54
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:32,340
No, not at all. He is fine.

55
00:06:32,694 --> 00:06:35,405
He needs to be monitored everyday.

56
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:38,843
I'll come tomorrow
and for next one month.

57
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:40,772
May be you won't like it.

58
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:44,586
Doctor, we need you doctor please.

59
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,186
Do you have a heart problem?

60
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:51,254
After looking at grandpa's condition in
tension she also got an asthama attack.

61
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:53,989
They both extremely love each other.

62
00:06:54,616 --> 00:06:57,395
If one person is hurt
then other feels the pain.

63
00:07:00,355 --> 00:07:02,599
Anny, tomorrow evening you
have to come to my dispensary.

64
00:07:02,658 --> 00:07:04,605
Yes, okay.
- I'll give you some medicines.

65
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:05,968
Okay doctor.

66
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:10,205
Take care of grandpa
as well as yourself okay.

67
00:07:10,265 --> 00:07:11,677
Sure.
- Bye.

68
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:13,043
Bye.

69
00:08:42,726 --> 00:08:46,576
Enough.. enough.
- Why are you acting like kids?

70
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,135
No, I'm not feeling like
eating anything. - Grandpa..

71
00:08:49,366 --> 00:08:50,107
Enough.

72
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,979
Okay fine, eat this apple at least.
- No not at all.

73
00:08:53,037 --> 00:08:54,642
Apple will make your
health absolutely fine.

74
00:08:54,704 --> 00:08:57,244
You know that phrase right.

75
00:08:57,441 --> 00:08:59,855
An apple a day, keeps the doctor away.

76
00:09:05,115 --> 00:09:08,793
Good grandpa today you
are really looking very fresh.

77
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:10,892
Thanks to you doctor.
- My pleasure.

78
00:09:11,956 --> 00:09:14,700
Till when I have to eat
this patient's type food.

79
00:09:15,826 --> 00:09:17,739
I'm tired of this disease.

80
00:09:17,795 --> 00:09:19,469
Who said that you are ill?

81
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:23,573
You are absolutely all right.
You can eat everything.

82
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,210
What are you saying?

83
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:27,650
It's not me,
grandpa's report is telling this.

84
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:31,479
With these medicines he
needs morning and evening walk.

85
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:35,855
Yes, everyday morning and evening I
take him for a walk in this compound.

86
00:09:35,913 --> 00:09:40,833
Come out of this compound
area and take grandpa also out.

87
00:09:41,286 --> 00:09:44,668
Morning hill side, evening lake side.

88
00:09:44,922 --> 00:09:47,838
Fresh air, new face.

89
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,372
I like it. Really, I like it.

90
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:55,437
I'm tired of seeing the same nurse.

91
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:58,312
Grandpa.
- Joking. I'm just joking.

92
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,821
Doctor, I keep telling
him that don't wear the uniform.

93
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:08,328
Or else I feel that I'm
not at home but in the hospital.

94
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:11,022
I think more than a nurse
she's your family member.

95
00:10:11,116 --> 00:10:12,494
Isn't it Nikita?
- Yes.

96
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,964
Anny, is with me from past three years.

97
00:10:18,223 --> 00:10:20,501
What happen to you?

98
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:24,038
I think some insect bit me.

99
00:10:27,632 --> 00:10:29,672
These insects are damn lucky.

100
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,111
Grandpa!

101
00:10:33,204 --> 00:10:36,381
Grandpa your sense
of humor is amazing.

102
00:10:38,677 --> 00:10:41,057
Nikita do you play chess?

103
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,354
Grandpa plays alone.

104
00:10:44,215 --> 00:10:50,229
I don't play, play my game
and wait for the other player.

105
00:10:51,523 --> 00:10:53,026
DO you play?

106
00:10:53,524 --> 00:10:54,834
Little bit.

107
00:10:55,027 --> 00:10:56,301
So let's have a game.

108
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:59,868
Not today, may be some other time.
I'll leave.

109
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,207
Okay doctor,
come I'll drop you till the car.

110
00:11:04,303 --> 00:11:05,874
You please sit, the nurse is here.

111
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,452
Please come.

112
00:11:18,684 --> 00:11:21,292
Hey!
- Leave.

113
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,898
Say something.
- What?

114
00:11:24,723 --> 00:11:25,999
Who bit you?

115
00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:28,099
Insect.

116
00:11:29,228 --> 00:11:31,801
Insect want to bite
you somewhere else also.

117
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:51,898
You be careful from the insect.

118
00:11:52,184 --> 00:11:53,494
What?

119
00:11:53,786 --> 00:11:56,167
These insects are very vicious.

120
00:12:08,535 --> 00:12:13,421
Wow, it's a very good location.

121
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:15,145
Thanks to doctor.
- Greetings.

122
00:12:15,241 --> 00:12:17,690
What are you doing
here so early morning.

123
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:23,526
We should always start our day with
a temple, my father says, use to say.

124
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:25,429
What do you mean by use to say?

125
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:30,301
My mom-dad left me alone
in the childhood and went to god.

126
00:12:30,857 --> 00:12:33,136
But I have their blessing always.

127
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:34,935
You know.

128
00:12:35,428 --> 00:12:36,932
Have a good life.
- I'll leave?

129
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,547
From when did you
start going to temple?

130
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:55,895
You won't understand.
This is my new plan.

131
00:12:56,116 --> 00:12:57,995
I understand all your plans.

132
00:12:58,051 --> 00:12:59,532
Really?

133
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:02,294
No.
- Yes.

134
00:13:02,356 --> 00:13:04,668
No.
- Yes.

135
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:06,000
I said no.

136
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:07,563
When a girl says no that means yes.

137
00:13:08,228 --> 00:13:10,302
And if she says yes?

138
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:13,504
Yes always means yes.

139
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:22,554
Grandpa,
this is my move and you are gone.

140
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,956
Yes. Yes.

141
00:13:25,714 --> 00:13:29,597
Grandpa, I think today you are gone.

142
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:36,939
Yes you move is good my dear.
But I'm not among losers.

143
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:40,466
Let's see.
- What's that, near your ears?

144
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:42,570
What?

145
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,736
May be a piece.
- I can't see anything.

146
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,109
Wait..

147
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:53,148
Grandpa, you spoilt the entire game.

148
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,710
Grandpa, this is cheating.

149
00:13:54,808 --> 00:13:56,221
You'll never improve.

150
00:13:56,278 --> 00:13:59,284
This is when you say got a support.

151
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,023
Is it?
- What do we say in English?

152
00:14:02,817 --> 00:14:05,767
Your favorite dialogue grandpa.
- Yes, what?

153
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,999
Everything is...
- Fair...

154
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:09,194
In...
- Love and...

155
00:14:09,257 --> 00:14:10,602
War.
- Yes.

156
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:19,241
Now make drink tea.
- Okay, sugar?

157
00:14:19,301 --> 00:14:20,940
Without sugar.
- Without sugar?

158
00:14:23,305 --> 00:14:24,307
Yes and let's play a game.

159
00:14:29,811 --> 00:14:31,156
You came.

160
00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:39,391
You and here?

161
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:40,863
I come here everyday.

162
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:43,935
You didn't came from two days.

163
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:46,002
Were you missing me?

164
00:14:48,463 --> 00:14:51,744
No, grandpa was missing you.

165
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:56,015
If you don't mind
should I say something?

166
00:14:56,739 --> 00:14:57,979
Yes say.

167
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:01,090
You please don't wear
this color dress and come here.

168
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,655
Why?

169
00:15:03,545 --> 00:15:07,964
This color excites me
a lot and I feel scared that""

170
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:12,592
...I should not loose control.

171
00:15:13,655 --> 00:15:15,137
You look hot.

172
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,915
Doctor Vaidh, where from India?

173
00:15:29,672 --> 00:15:33,282
North""
- Where in north?

174
00:15:33,643 --> 00:15:37,686
From Rohtak twenty kilometers
far a village Ramgad.

175
00:15:38,347 --> 00:15:43,427
Ramgad? I went there in 1940.

176
00:15:43,786 --> 00:15:47,738
At that time there use to be ghosts.
Are they still there?

177
00:15:48,658 --> 00:15:52,303
Grandpa, I'm a doctor and
I don't believe in ghost talks.

178
00:15:52,362 --> 00:15:55,471
It's not that but self experience.

179
00:15:58,801 --> 00:16:04,485
Please grandpa, don't talk
about all these things I feel scared.

180
00:16:04,874 --> 00:16:07,289
There's nothing to get scared,
come on grandpa tell me

181
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:10,654
No grandpa, not today.

182
00:16:10,714 --> 00:16:12,217
Be a brave girl.

183
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,964
Outside the village, next
to the lake there was a graveyard.

184
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:21,529
They say that one cyclonic night""

185
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:25,208
...there was a newly married girl..

186
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:30,340
...was crossing the lake
with the entire family.

187
00:16:30,734 --> 00:16:32,613
Suddenly the boat turned""

188
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:37,212
...and everybody as well
as the married girl was drowned.

189
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:41,824
After that incident
on every black out night""

190
00:16:42,512 --> 00:16:49,529
...the bride's spirit cries
for her unfulfilled wishes..

191
00:16:50,153 --> 00:16:53,434
...and pounces on anybody
passing from there.

192
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,972
I don't believe it.
- I also never believed it.

193
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,969
But one night we friends
has a challenge..

194
00:17:00,631 --> 00:17:06,087
...and I with my friend Shiva
went to see that witch near the lake.

195
00:17:06,971 --> 00:17:13,656
It was rainy season,
the wind was blowing..

196
00:17:16,547 --> 00:17:23,233
""Lights were thundering
and complete black out.

197
00:17:24,455 --> 00:17:28,635
Both of us in that darkness
for the directions.

198
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:36,886
...were helping ourselves
with a small fire light.

199
00:17:37,502 --> 00:17:40,145
Where to go and how to
go was there in our minds..

200
00:17:40,872 --> 00:17:43,754
...and then we heard
a sound of an anklet.

201
00:17:52,784 --> 00:17:54,823
Darkness everywhere.

202
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:58,894
Suddenly a dog started barking..

203
00:18:00,725 --> 00:18:03,174
...and a lady was crying.

204
00:18:07,632 --> 00:18:11,106
Then we stepped back..

205
00:18:12,537 --> 00:18:15,077
...and somebody held
my neck from behind.

206
00:18:16,674 --> 00:18:19,351
Grandpa..
- Stop this nonsense.

207
00:18:19,644 --> 00:18:22,857
Grandpa, you know that
Nikita's heart is very weak..

208
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:25,725
...then why you have to do all this?

209
00:18:25,818 --> 00:18:27,993
Forget it Nikita.
- Grandpa..

210
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:31,294
Do ghost catch people?

211
00:18:31,623 --> 00:18:33,902
No, they just scare us from far..

212
00:18:33,992 --> 00:18:38,001
...If they catch us
they'll die immediately.

213
00:18:38,063 --> 00:18:41,640
I'll leave, as it is
I have to pass by a lake side.

214
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,642
Son, tomorrow will you come in
the afternoon wanted to speak to you.

215
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:49,148
Okay, I will come.
- Okay take care of yourself.

216
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,690
Do you know why that oldie
has called me in the afternoon?

217
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,584
I don't know.

218
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,090
May be asking for
a discount on the bill.

219
00:18:57,282 --> 00:19:00,323
Discount""
maybe he'll eat the entire bill.

220
00:19:00,553 --> 00:19:03,696
No, he's not going to eat the bill.

221
00:19:04,123 --> 00:19:05,569
Why?

222
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:09,265
In his house he's having
a thing like you to eat.

223
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:11,742
...then why will he eat the bill.
- You idiot.

224
00:20:14,694 --> 00:20:15,970
Good morning grandpa.

225
00:20:16,162 --> 00:20:17,871
Good morning, come.

226
00:20:18,332 --> 00:20:22,010
I'm fine. I will always
be fine if you both are not around.

227
00:20:22,035 --> 00:20:25,316
Get Dr. Vaidh some lassi.
- Okay grandpa.

228
00:20:25,672 --> 00:20:27,985
How are you?
- Fine sit down.

229
00:20:31,145 --> 00:20:36,862
Dr. Vaidh,
should I call you doctor or Vaidh?

230
00:20:37,016 --> 00:20:38,896
You just call me Aryan.

231
00:20:38,986 --> 00:20:45,706
Aryan good, so I have thought
a lot and decided that""

232
00:20:46,427 --> 00:20:48,466
""Nikita should get married to you.

233
00:20:48,563 --> 00:20:49,907
Me?

234
00:20:49,964 --> 00:20:51,468
Do you have a problem?

235
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,537
Don't you like Nikita?

236
00:20:55,302 --> 00:20:57,443
But have you asked her about this?

237
00:20:57,504 --> 00:21:00,580
She knows that my
selection cannot be wrong.

238
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:09,028
If you say yes then the rest of
the days of my life will go happily.

239
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:16,707
But remember one thing
don't ever hurt my Nikita.

240
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:20,641
Or else I'll die the same moment.

241
00:21:21,028 --> 00:21:25,344
It's nothing like that grandpa, I'm
very lucky, that you think I'm capable.

242
00:21:25,433 --> 00:21:30,250
But I want to get settled,
I haven't bought a house yet.

243
00:21:30,471 --> 00:21:33,455
For this point I have proposed you.

244
00:21:33,841 --> 00:21:35,413
I'm selfish.

245
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:40,055
If you had your own house, I
would have never given Nikita to you.

246
00:21:40,915 --> 00:21:44,093
Suppose, if after marriage
she goes with you..

247
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:46,432
...then what will happen to this oldie.

248
00:21:47,489 --> 00:21:53,706
And after marriage everything
is yours, isn't it?

249
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:03,919
So next week your marriage
is fixed with Nikita.

250
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:06,118
No.

251
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:08,783
Thank you, grandpa.
- Be happy son.

252
00:22:10,778 --> 00:22:13,318
I love you and only you.

253
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:16,764
Then why didn't you
reject his proposal?

254
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,739
If I have got a chance
for our better future..

255
00:22:23,524 --> 00:22:25,234
...why should loose that chance.

256
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,334
Why don't you understand?

257
00:22:35,905 --> 00:22:39,788
I don't even have that much
money to buy a house for ourselves.

258
00:22:41,143 --> 00:22:42,623
That's why you are leaving me?

259
00:22:44,513 --> 00:22:46,495
This marriage will not long last.

260
00:22:47,048 --> 00:22:51,001
...she is a heart patient
and can't fulfill my sexual needs.

261
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:58,041
On this point I will take a divorce and
I will get a good pan of the property.

262
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,299
It's just the matter of a year or two.

263
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:05,212
You are talking about a year or two,""

264
00:23:05,835 --> 00:23:09,513
...you know that I can't leave
without you for a single moment.

265
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:15,483
My every moment, every breathe,
every night is just for you.

266
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:22,399
I love you, Aryan.
I love you.

267
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:33,378
One girl is already married,
now is your turn.

268
00:23:35,131 --> 00:23:36,441
What are you thinking?

269
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,545
<i>'Zryan.
' Wan?</i>

270
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,378
Grandpa isn't it cold today?
- Why?

271
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:45,251
So where Nikita and Aryan
are there must be so cold.

272
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:50,959
Couples who go for honeymoon,
they never feel cold.

273
00:23:51,949 --> 00:23:57,165
They crazy and they freak with
their hearts for ways and directions.

274
00:24:26,784 --> 00:24:36,111
""With our crazy heart,
we wander every destination.""

275
00:24:45,536 --> 00:24:54,761
""With our crazy heart,
we wander every destination.""

276
00:24:54,845 --> 00:25:03,365
""O dear, meet me somewhere
in any nook and corner.""

277
00:25:03,421 --> 00:25:13,341
""With our crazy heart,
we wander every destination.""

278
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:59,723
""We both stay in the same lane,
but we are helpless.""

279
00:26:00,078 --> 00:26:09,008
""You are here, I am here,
but still there are distances here.""

280
00:26:09,421 --> 00:26:17,905
""Strange world.
The granduer of the world are unique.""

281
00:26:17,996 --> 00:26:23,001
""With our crazy heart,
we wander every destination.""

282
00:27:02,975 --> 00:27:12,098
""Wherever you are, I feel,
you are close to my heart here.""

283
00:27:12,151 --> 00:27:21,549
""I wish for your well-being.
Without you, I feel sad, here.""

284
00:27:21,628 --> 00:27:30,284
""Come, come.
Come and embrace me.""

285
00:27:30,937 --> 00:27:40,492
""With our crazy heart,
we wander every destination.""

286
00:28:20,154 --> 00:28:21,931
I'm sorry.

287
00:28:29,097 --> 00:28:30,600
Sorry.

288
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,110
It's okay.

289
00:28:47,481 --> 00:28:51,490
Marriage is not just a start of a sexual
relationship but also our soul mate.

290
00:28:54,756 --> 00:28:57,763
It's not necessary to
fulfill the sexual needs.

291
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,207
If you get an attack because of this""

292
00:29:03,965 --> 00:29:09,887
...so I'll do your treatment
first and then love.

293
00:29:12,607 --> 00:29:16,285
I don't want to loose you Nikita,
I love you.

294
00:29:19,881 --> 00:29:23,628
It's good that this date is finalized,
that's why your presence was important.

295
00:29:23,685 --> 00:29:25,360
Now everything will be fine.

296
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,795
Hello grandpa.

301
00:29:39,601 --> 00:29:41,412

Baby now you are married and

But if you win today's game
I'll give you the bungalow as well.

00:31:04,587 --> 00:31:07,036
Grandpa is cheating.
- Very bad.

325
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:09,997
Everything is fair in love and war.

326
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,138
Son this is not cheating,
it's teaching.

327
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,940
I'm trying to teach you
only then you'll be happy.

328
00:31:18,202 --> 00:31:19,876

00:31:28,878 --> 00:31:30,986
Oh god I'm sorry.

00:31:53,303 --> 00:31:55,342
Leave me, somebody will see.

340
00:31:55,406 --> 00:31:58,823
Nobody will see.. I need you.

341
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,984
Why you never got a chance
during your honeymoon?

342
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:04,590
The entire night I suffer.

343
00:32:07,952 --> 00:32:09,899
And I have lost my consciousness.

344
00:32:11,656 --> 00:32:14,264
Not right now,
we'll meet during the night time.

345
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:20,010
Leave you, I need you come on.

346
00:32:21,832 --> 00:32:24,144
I had fun by fooling that doctor.

347
00:33:02,373 --> 00:33:05,914
""I don't know darling...""

348
00:33:11,482 --> 00:33:19,808
""I don't know what
sorrow is, darling.""

349
00:33:19,858 --> 00:33:29,311
""Whenever I take your name,
I'm surrounded with joy.""

350
00:33:29,802 --> 00:33:38,127
""I don't know what
sorrow is, darling.""

351
00:33:38,176 --> 00:33:47,470
""Whenever I take your name,
I'm surrounded with joy.""

352
00:33:48,086 --> 00:33:52,334
""I don't know darling...""

353
00:34:16,148 --> 00:34:20,191
""Since the time our eyes have met..""

354
00:34:20,486 --> 00:34:29,210
""..I've adorned myself
with your glance.""

355
00:34:29,761 --> 00:34:32,335
""See, my darling.""

356
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:38,285
""Since the time our eyes have met..""

357
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:47,460
""..I've adorned myself
with your glance.""

358
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,656
""See, my darling.""

359
00:34:52,618 --> 00:35:01,172
""When you held my wrists with love..""

360
00:35:01,828 --> 00:35:10,348
""..your fingers became my bangles.""

361
00:35:10,403 --> 00:35:18,523
""I don't what sorrow is, darling.""

362
00:35:18,712 --> 00:35:28,200
""Whenever I take your name,
I'm surrounded with joy.""

363
00:35:38,433 --> 00:35:40,436
Grandpa, you'll never improve.

364
00:35:41,735 --> 00:35:43,342
Its Aryan's phone.

365
00:35:43,504 --> 00:35:45,109
- Go and give it to Aryan.
- I'll go right away.

366
00:35:58,852 --> 00:36:00,732
Nikita.
- Your phone was ringing.

367
00:36:02,089 --> 00:36:03,399
Thank you.

368
00:36:04,692 --> 00:36:06,298
Let's go.
- Lets go.

369
00:36:14,268 --> 00:36:15,749
What's the matter?

370
00:36:19,674 --> 00:36:22,088
Bloody oldie cheater.

371
00:36:23,912 --> 00:36:25,449
What happen Aryan?

372
00:36:25,646 --> 00:36:31,568
He has given everylhing to
Nikita and after she dies to me.

373
00:36:32,553 --> 00:36:34,796
Are you thinking of killing Nikita?

374
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,796
Do I want to go Jail?

375
00:36:37,658 --> 00:36:44,515
If Nikita suicides or is murdered,
everybody will a finger on me.

376
00:36:46,201 --> 00:36:50,951
Anyhow she should die,
but the death should be natural.

377
00:36:52,241 --> 00:36:55,987
You only said that Nikita's
heart is weak right.

378
00:36:56,277 --> 00:36:57,621
Yes.

379
00:36:58,479 --> 00:37:07,806
That means any pain
or fear will stop her heart.

380
00:37:08,156 --> 00:37:09,398
So?

381
00:37:09,491 --> 00:37:11,598
So my work will be done.

382
00:37:12,261 --> 00:37:17,010
You said that grandpa and
Nikita extremely love each other.

383
00:37:17,499 --> 00:37:18,204
Yes.

384
00:37:18,299 --> 00:37:22,150
If one person is hurt
then other feels the pain.

385
00:37:22,738 --> 00:37:27,123
Yes, but I never understood anything.

386
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,983
But I have understood everything.

387
00:37:30,879 --> 00:37:36,528
If the grand-daughter is hurt she
will never tell this to her grandpa.

388
00:37:37,553 --> 00:37:42,200
Or else grandpa goes up.

389
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:45,234
Everylhing will belong to me.

390
00:37:47,263 --> 00:37:49,677
Anyways this oldie
has done one thing good.

391
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:53,175
The bungalows guesthouse
gave it to you.

392
00:37:53,569 --> 00:37:54,674
Oh really.

393
00:37:56,972 --> 00:38:00,184
If you want we can make
our own world of love..

394
00:38:01,443 --> 00:38:03,653
...let it be by anybody else's death.

395
00:38:20,162 --> 00:38:21,370
Leave me.

396
00:38:25,368 --> 00:38:26,507
What?

397
00:38:32,274 --> 00:38:34,154
What If I get the attack again then.

398
00:38:35,478 --> 00:38:36,685
Sit down.

399
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:46,193
Aryan.

400
00:38:46,256 --> 00:38:49,399
Nothing will happen,
maybe this is just your fear.

401
00:38:50,827 --> 00:38:53,036
<i>Okay'</i>

402
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,496
Aryan no.

403
00:39:18,288 --> 00:39:21,739
It's okay come on you feel so nice.

404
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,906
Yeah, okay.

405
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,374
No.

406
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,763
Shit.. don't touch me.

407
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:11,115
Aryan.. Aryan.. Aryan..

408
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:16,262
Aryan, listen to me.
At least have breakfast.

409
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,643
Now how are you? Your medicines.

410
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,006
Give.

411
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,551
Daughter. ls my selection wrong?

412
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,182
No.

413
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:51,920
See fights happen between couples.

414
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:55,792
If one is upset the other
can convince the other.

415
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:06,843
I think he has come,
handle him with love go ahead.

416
00:41:08,367 --> 00:41:09,312
<i>Okay'</i>

417
00:41:33,025 --> 00:41:34,904
Aryan.

418
00:41:35,594 --> 00:41:37,235
Aryan.

419
00:42:05,158 --> 00:42:06,695
What are you both doing?

420
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,671
What is this happening?
- Can't you see?

421
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:17,172
Are you kid?

422
00:42:18,038 --> 00:42:19,382
Should I explain?

423
00:42:21,974 --> 00:42:26,826
The thing which you could not do after
marriage, I'm doing that with her.

424
00:42:29,115 --> 00:42:31,723
Marriage is finding a soul mate.

425
00:42:34,387 --> 00:42:36,233
It's all bullshit.

426
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:42,507
Marriage is a legal certificate
to fulfill sexual needs.

427
00:42:44,965 --> 00:42:50,113
But a man who has a wife like
you he has to find somebody outside.

428
00:42:50,737 --> 00:42:52,980
I'll surely throw
you out of this house.

429
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:55,579
Get out.
- Move.

430
00:42:56,177 --> 00:42:58,625
How many people are
you going to throw out?

431
00:42:58,845 --> 00:43:04,995
You can't fulfill my needs
so should I go to prostitute?

432
00:43:05,786 --> 00:43:08,861
Instead let this
stay inside the house.

433
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:11,234
In the society grandpa's
name will get spoilt.

434
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:15,839
Come we'll go to grandpa
and talk about our divorce.

435
00:43:16,964 --> 00:43:19,469
You want divorce, not I.

436
00:43:21,368 --> 00:43:22,746
Should I tell him that grandpa..

437
00:43:22,803 --> 00:43:27,882
...your grand-daughter
can't support me on the bed.

438
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,983
Tell Anny that she'll stay here.
Right here.

439
00:43:33,881 --> 00:43:34,860
No.

440
00:43:34,948 --> 00:43:40,906
Now you get lost and let
me finish what I started with, okay.

441
00:43:42,656 --> 00:43:45,469
'Daughter, is my selection wrong?'

442
00:44:09,817 --> 00:44:11,422
Is this the way you work.

443
00:44:11,486 --> 00:44:14,025
You spoiled my important documents.

444
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:19,166
After half an hour I need to give
a presentation how will I do that?

445
00:44:19,561 --> 00:44:21,941
Aryan I...

446
00:44:21,996 --> 00:44:24,103
What I'll do?
- Aryan I...

447
00:44:24,266 --> 00:44:26,110
What are you saying?

448
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,681
I'm sorry.

449
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:31,342
In this meeting I was suppose
to get three crore rupees.

450
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:35,017
Now who will give me
the money your father""

451
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:40,257
...or your grandpa that oldie,
what money he'll give.

452
00:44:41,248 --> 00:44:44,461
He wants that my entire
life I should be your servant.

453
00:44:44,552 --> 00:44:47,730
Aryan, I'll prepare
coffee for you right now.

454
00:44:48,356 --> 00:44:51,533
Leave it, I say. Leave it.

455
00:44:54,196 --> 00:44:56,372
Go and make your grandpa
listen to your story crying.

456
00:44:58,133 --> 00:44:59,238
What happen?

457
00:44:59,301 --> 00:45:03,345
Grandpa you came,
now tell your problem to him.

458
00:45:03,939 --> 00:45:06,012
Why don't you take care of yourself?

459
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:12,091
You know that if you
are hurt I also feel so hurt.

460
00:45:12,514 --> 00:45:15,327
...and you just burnt your hands.

461
00:45:15,551 --> 00:45:17,225
What, burnt her hand?

462
00:45:17,285 --> 00:45:20,098
See grandpa.
- Oh God, show me.

463
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:22,168
Is there any need of ironing?

464
00:45:23,626 --> 00:45:26,132
Please don't do that again.

465
00:45:28,664 --> 00:45:31,477
Aryan don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

466
00:45:33,168 --> 00:45:37,053
Today I have realized that
you love my daughter Nikita so much.

467
00:45:37,473 --> 00:45:43,327
See Nikita didn't I tell you
that my selection cannot go wrong.

468
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,989
But I doubt you for one thing.

469
00:45:49,485 --> 00:45:50,794
Doubt?

470
00:45:51,587 --> 00:45:53,694
Are you still young?

471
00:45:54,023 --> 00:45:55,503
Why g rand pa?

472
00:45:55,858 --> 00:46:00,005
Actually I have never seen
you going to a disco or a pub..

473
00:46:00,195 --> 00:46:01,267
""That's why was asking.

474
00:46:01,364 --> 00:46:02,708
Grandpa.

475
00:46:03,432 --> 00:46:07,009
My teenage has been in
the disco or a pub every night.

476
00:46:07,437 --> 00:46:11,013
Tonight you have to take
my Nikita to a nice disco.

477
00:46:11,107 --> 00:46:13,852
And that should be
happening and rocking.

478
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:15,618
Wow, what an idea.

479
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,687
I'll come early today in the evening,
you be ready.

480
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:24,696
Aryan should I wear
my pink colored top""

481
00:46:24,788 --> 00:46:28,001
...because I know whenever
I wear that top you get excited.

482
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,536
I like it. I like it.

483
00:46:34,798 --> 00:46:39,616
When you are in a pink
colored dress I get excited, Anny.

484
00:46:42,372 --> 00:46:48,056
You be ready at night.
We'll have fun.. dancing.

485
00:46:49,479 --> 00:46:51,221
So you be ready and nicely take bath.

486
00:46:51,381 --> 00:46:56,460
Because I don't eat fruits without
washing them, after all I'm a doctor.

487
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:04,235
Grandpa should I take
Anny also along with us.

488
00:47:04,294 --> 00:47:06,105
She'll also enjoy in the disco.

489
00:47:12,903 --> 00:47:15,442
Why do these girls take
so much time to get ready?

490
00:47:16,206 --> 00:47:20,283
Aryan pay attention over here,
or else you'll loose your queen.

491
00:47:20,578 --> 00:47:23,151
If queen dead then the game is over.

492
00:47:23,213 --> 00:47:26,494
And my horse is going to
end up your game in two moves.

493
00:47:28,419 --> 00:47:30,662
Grandpa it's the modern
technology with space jets

494
00:47:31,021 --> 00:47:36,204
Horse moves will not help you,
take this and handle your game now.

495
00:47:36,261 --> 00:47:37,764
Oh, when did this happen?

496
00:47:38,763 --> 00:47:40,300
Hats off to you Aryan.

497
00:47:40,397 --> 00:47:44,179
You make your moves very slowly..

498
00:47:44,269 --> 00:47:48,015
...and the opposite person doesn't
even come to you that he is trapped.

499
00:47:50,775 --> 00:47:51,983
Nikita.

500
00:47:53,143 --> 00:47:54,317
Nikita.

501
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,561
What happen?

502
00:47:59,217 --> 00:48:00,663
What happen?

503
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:05,270
Aryan see she burnt my dress.

504
00:48:07,526 --> 00:48:14,142
So I cannot stop you people, but
at least I can reduce your excitement.

505
00:48:26,812 --> 00:48:28,156
You..

506
00:48:28,413 --> 00:48:29,792
What happen?

507
00:48:31,149 --> 00:48:32,630
Nothing grandpa.

508
00:48:39,057 --> 00:48:43,033
Aryan what should I wear now,
see she burnt your favorite dress.

509
00:48:47,032 --> 00:48:52,077
Wear anything,
I like you without dress.

510
00:48:53,905 --> 00:48:55,580
You look stunning.

511
00:49:25,204 --> 00:49:26,480
What happen?

512
00:49:28,975 --> 00:49:30,353
What happen?

513
00:49:32,244 --> 00:49:33,417
Do you love me?

514
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,492
Of course I love you.

515
00:49:36,649 --> 00:49:38,027
Prove it.

516
00:49:42,989 --> 00:49:45,836
I want to see a different
kind of love making.

517
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:47,503
What?

518
00:49:51,431 --> 00:49:53,173
Have you gone mad.

519
00:49:53,232 --> 00:49:55,772
At least don't make fun of my love?

520
00:49:58,404 --> 00:49:59,907
Go.

521
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,683
I can't.
- Bloody hell.

522
00:50:03,576 --> 00:50:05,215
You can't.

523
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:12,160
No.

524
00:50:17,024 --> 00:50:18,299
No.

525
00:50:21,461 --> 00:50:23,306
Don't hit her, please.

526
00:50:24,932 --> 00:50:26,344
<i>Okay'</i>

527
00:50:30,403 --> 00:50:31,748
No.

528
00:50:48,956 --> 00:50:50,630
You came my daughter.

529
00:50:53,526 --> 00:50:56,009
Yes grandpa.. I have come.

530
00:50:56,096 --> 00:50:57,805
Did you enjoy?

531
00:51:03,503 --> 00:51:07,547
Yes, I enjoyed.

532
00:51:08,109 --> 00:51:09,315
<i>Okay'</i>

533
00:51:32,766 --> 00:51:36,513
It's very late I think you should go.

534
00:51:57,058 --> 00:51:58,333
Now go.

535
00:52:07,101 --> 00:52:10,609
Today I want to make some
different type of love making.

536
00:52:10,905 --> 00:52:12,510
No, please.

537
00:52:13,908 --> 00:52:15,981
You are telling me no.

538
00:52:17,511 --> 00:52:19,824
No, Aryan please.

539
00:52:21,583 --> 00:52:22,892
No.

540
00:52:24,486 --> 00:52:25,830
No.

541
00:52:30,658 --> 00:52:34,303
Is it paining? I am sorry.

542
00:52:36,298 --> 00:52:37,869
It pained me also?

543
00:52:41,103 --> 00:52:44,315
My seniors demanded the same thing.

544
00:52:48,978 --> 00:52:51,085
Demanded the same thing.

545
00:52:54,316 --> 00:53:01,765
And I also demanded the
same thing from my juniors.

546
00:53:03,959 --> 00:53:05,998
It was painful for them as well.

547
00:53:08,964 --> 00:53:12,415
Later they were habituated.

548
00:53:17,407 --> 00:53:19,217
Even you'll get habituated.

549
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:27,957
I'll do the dressing.

550
00:53:29,418 --> 00:53:30,899
I love you.

551
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:33,965
I love you.

552
00:53:49,705 --> 00:53:52,245
Aryan, where are you going?

553
00:53:52,842 --> 00:53:57,991
I'm going out for three days, when
I'm back I need three crore rupees.

554
00:53:58,982 --> 00:54:02,489
3 crore rupees?
- I said the same.

555
00:54:02,752 --> 00:54:04,825
I don't have that much money.

556
00:54:07,357 --> 00:54:09,430
From where should I get the money?

557
00:54:09,525 --> 00:54:12,509
Get it from anywhere, I need it.

558
00:54:15,031 --> 00:54:18,608
I'm asking for three crore rupees.

559
00:54:18,802 --> 00:54:21,843
Aryan, I don't have that much cash.

560
00:54:22,338 --> 00:54:25,949
So sell of the farm house of grandpa.

561
00:54:26,677 --> 00:54:29,923
If not that then change the will.

562
00:54:31,348 --> 00:54:33,956
Transfer some pan
of the will in my name.

563
00:54:38,321 --> 00:54:42,535
But Aryan, that's impossible.

564
00:54:54,404 --> 00:54:56,283
You think you are very smart.

565
00:54:56,673 --> 00:55:00,716
Why you didn't think this
while spoiling my loan papers.

566
00:55:33,178 --> 00:55:34,658
What are you thinking?

567
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:37,156
There is nothing to think about.

568
00:55:37,715 --> 00:55:43,262
The demand that man has made
it is impossible to fulfill Nikita

569
00:55:43,488 --> 00:55:47,338
Yes, he is cruel.

570
00:55:48,293 --> 00:55:52,871
And if you don't fulfill
his demand he'll kill you.

571
00:55:54,732 --> 00:55:58,309
And if you die, grandpa will also die.

572
00:55:58,837 --> 00:56:03,119
This entire property
will belong to him.

573
00:56:03,308 --> 00:56:08,387
If you talk to grandpa to fulfill your
demands, grandpa will die of shock.

574
00:56:09,213 --> 00:56:13,496
If grandpa dies,
you'll die of shock.

575
00:56:13,919 --> 00:56:17,095
In both the ways,
property will belong to him.

576
00:56:18,724 --> 00:56:21,366
I am not concern about property,
I am concern about grandpa.

577
00:56:21,827 --> 00:56:25,870
If you want I can
help you out of this.

578
00:56:27,698 --> 00:56:28,804
Help?

579
00:56:30,268 --> 00:56:32,307
Anny what happen to you?

580
00:56:33,405 --> 00:56:34,943
Thanks to your husband.

581
00:56:35,507 --> 00:56:37,489
Yesterday night you spoilt his mood..

582
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:42,989
...and to improve his mood,
he spoilt my condition.

583
00:56:44,116 --> 00:56:45,859
He's an animal!

584
00:56:46,819 --> 00:56:51,739
He hits before making love
and even after making love.

585
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:53,563
What?
- Yes.

586
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,200
You have not yet reached
the stage of love..

587
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:01,307
...you won't believe
I myself want to leave him.

588
00:57:01,367 --> 00:57:02,369
So why don't you go.

589
00:57:02,468 --> 00:57:05,543
He'll come anywhere to find me out.

590
00:57:07,206 --> 00:57:09,347
There's only one
way to get rid of him.

591
00:57:09,442 --> 00:57:10,581
What?

592
00:57:10,943 --> 00:57:12,653
If you are ready to help me out.

593
00:57:13,446 --> 00:57:14,482
What?

594
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:46,591
That bastard must be calling, he'll
say that he is coming one day before.

595
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,692
Hello.
- Hello.

596
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,466
I'm coming one day before.

597
00:57:56,122 --> 00:57:57,660
You are coming one day before.

598
00:57:57,757 --> 00:57:58,862
Yes.

599
00:57:58,925 --> 00:58:00,372
One minute just hold on.

600
00:58:07,634 --> 00:58:09,673
Hello.
- What about my money?

601
00:58:10,837 --> 00:58:12,341
Is it done?
- No.

602
00:58:13,874 --> 00:58:15,856
Aryan listen to me very carefully.

603
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:26,697
So this is the case okay.

604
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:36,300
Take this bottle and mix it.

605
00:58:36,363 --> 00:58:37,901
I can't do it.

606
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:43,218
Oh god come on you have to,
I'm with you.

607
00:58:47,808 --> 00:58:49,517
Please I'm really scared.

608
00:58:49,876 --> 00:58:51,790
There's nothing to get scared about""

609
00:58:52,212 --> 00:58:56,062
...you just need to give
him a good reason and trap him..

610
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:59,966
...and then later
try and make him drink.

611
00:59:00,187 --> 00:59:04,641
After that whatever
is to be done it's by me.

612
00:59:05,392 --> 00:59:07,705
Grandpa..
- He has come.

613
00:59:08,763 --> 00:59:10,243
Grandpa.

614
00:59:17,505 --> 00:59:19,544
Grandpa, how are you? I missed you.

615
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:21,912

Silence, go!

01:06:29,143 --> 01:06:32,959
Nothing grandpa,
there's a horror film on the TV.

675
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,091
Put some other channel.

676
01:06:36,115 --> 01:06:37,654
Okay grandpa.

677
01:06:48,762 --> 01:06:53,581
What have you done, you killed her?

678
01:06:53,635 --> 01:07:00,719
I did not kill her, I can't kill her.

679
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:07,625
She attacked me.

680
01:07:09,216 --> 01:07:15,504
And for self defence, I killed her.

681
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:21,243
But I never killed her alone..

682
01:07:21,963 --> 01:07:26,178
...this scarf is your right.

683
01:07:27,535 --> 01:07:29,244
So?

684
01:07:29,404 --> 01:07:34,484
You must be having
your finger prints on it.

685
01:07:37,579 --> 01:07:40,586
I killed her?

686
01:07:40,748 --> 01:07:44,791
Yes, we both together killed her.

687
01:07:45,253 --> 01:07:46,734
No..

688
01:07:47,055 --> 01:07:51,975
But anyways you are very innocent.

689
01:07:52,261 --> 01:07:54,869
This was just an incident.

690
01:07:56,331 --> 01:08:00,842
You are innocent
and I'm also innocent.

691
01:08:01,704 --> 01:08:03,378
No.
- I'm also innocent.

692
01:08:04,139 --> 01:08:05,483
No.

693
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:11,790
You don't know Nikita

694
01:08:12,348 --> 01:08:14,626
I love you.

695
01:08:16,685 --> 01:08:23,108
And this bitch she
fooled me against you.

696
01:08:24,693 --> 01:08:32,985
I have always loved you.

697
01:08:36,538 --> 01:08:40,115
She fooled me against you.

698
01:08:40,476 --> 01:08:45,659
She black mailed me
for the previous things.

699
01:08:46,014 --> 01:08:48,122
She black mailed me.

700
01:08:48,317 --> 01:08:53,322
I didn't want to.. but still
I had to have sex with her.

701
01:09:02,465 --> 01:09:11,122
Nikita"" God may delay,
but will never disappoint you.

702
01:09:12,175 --> 01:09:19,532
I don't want anything,
my problem is solved.

703
01:09:19,582 --> 01:09:24,195
I don't need money.
I don't need your money.

704
01:09:25,822 --> 01:09:33,578
Come, we both will dig
her body somewhere. Yes.

705
01:09:33,763 --> 01:09:36,303
Come.

No, I won't do this.

708
01:09:42,104 --> 01:09:44,451
You have to support me..

709
01:09:44,507 --> 01:09:48,688
...or else everybody will come
to know that we both killed her.

710
01:09:48,913 --> 01:09:52,489
And then police will
come they will arrest us.

711
01:09:52,582 --> 01:09:57,468
Grandpa will get an attack,
he will die.

712
01:09:57,721 --> 01:10:01,731
No, this cannot happen, not grandpa.

713
01:10:02,359 --> 01:10:05,970
No, Aryan.

714
01:10:06,864 --> 01:10:09,541

Every drop of my blood

You don't believe

01:11:22,107 --> 01:11:23,951
Aryan.. this""

731
01:11:24,242 --> 01:11:29,629
Nothing will happen Nikita,
you don't worry at all.

732
01:11:30,181 --> 01:11:33,359
And don't let this know to anybody.
Keep this in your mind.

733
01:11:33,419 --> 01:11:36,664
Now go and get the car.

734
01:11:37,055 --> 01:11:38,969
Go fast I'll manage
everything go fast.

735
01:11:47,165 --> 01:11:48,544

01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:54,719
You wait here for a minute
I'll get my cell phone.

737
01:11:54,907 --> 01:11:59,258
Here. No. You wait here,
I'll get the cell phone.

738
01:11:59,311 --> 01:12:00,518
It's okay.

739
01:12:15,494 --> 01:12:16,770
Stop.

740
01:12:21,734 --> 01:12:23,180
Police.

741
01:12:24,337 --> 01:12:25,817
Do you have a jack with you?

742
01:12:26,205 --> 01:12:28,209
No we don't have it.
- We have it.

743
01:12:37,816 --> 01:12:41,496
This bag is very heavy,
what's there in it?

744
01:12:42,888 --> 01:12:44,130
Books.

745
01:12:45,624 --> 01:12:48,471
Thank you,
I'll give the jack to you later.

746
01:12:48,695 --> 01:12:51,268
Yes, give to us later okay.

747
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:02,049
It's okay.

748
01:13:41,848 --> 01:13:43,158
What happen?

749
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,629
What happen?

750
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:52,696
I saw a nightmare.

751
01:13:54,527 --> 01:13:59,538
Anny is with a scarf coming behind me.

752
01:14:01,068 --> 01:14:03,312
She wanted to kill me Aryan.

753
01:14:05,839 --> 01:14:08,413
Nikita control yourself.

754
01:14:10,244 --> 01:14:13,855
Forget her. She is dead.

755
01:14:14,248 --> 01:14:18,063
We both have killed her together,
she is past tense.

756
01:14:21,522 --> 01:14:28,174
Aryan, whatever we did was wrong.

757
01:14:29,330 --> 01:14:31,642
With wrong people if we do
wrong things there harm in that.

758
01:14:32,033 --> 01:14:35,141
And whatever I did
was to save my house.

759
01:14:35,603 --> 01:14:37,016
But..

760
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:45,326
I said forget this incident,
now go to sleep.

761
01:14:50,284 --> 01:14:52,095
Come on.

762
01:14:59,293 --> 01:15:00,899
Anny has not come yet.

763
01:15:01,262 --> 01:15:03,574
Now she'll never come.
- What?

764
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:09,114
Nikita means that she
went home yesterday night.

765
01:15:09,604 --> 01:15:11,813
Why did she go, without meeting me?

766
01:15:12,874 --> 01:15:14,355
One phone call had come..

767
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:16,482
...It seems that there is
somebody serious at her place.

768
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:18,790
Who is serious?

769
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:22,061
Her father is serious.

770
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,526
Her father passed
away three years back.

771
01:15:25,054 --> 01:15:26,557
So may be her mom..

772
01:15:26,888 --> 01:15:31,808
...actually in a hurry she
forgot to tell us, isn't it Nikita?

773
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:36,542
Yes, she was in a hurry.
- Is she going to come back?

774
01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:40,143
People who go, they never come back.
- What?

775
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:43,842
She has taken an advance..

776
01:15:43,938 --> 01:15:46,751
...and people who work and take
the advance they never come back.

777
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:51,158
Excuse me grandpa.

778
01:15:57,019 --> 01:15:59,935
What was the need of telling
that she will not come back?

779
01:16:00,523 --> 01:16:05,671
Aryan, I'm sorry.
I cannot lie any more.

780
01:16:07,263 --> 01:16:10,578
I can't support you for this.

781
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:13,510
We'll go and tell the
police that whatever happen..

782
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:15,615
...was just for our self defence.

783
01:16:16,673 --> 01:16:19,054
And the police will agree to you.

784
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:21,789
And if they ask where
is the dead body then?

785
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:23,916
So we'll say that...

786
01:16:23,981 --> 01:16:29,197
We both have thrown the body in water,
so that police should not come to know.

787
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:32,736
Nikki you have done two crimes..

788
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:37,341
...one is a murder and the second is
hide the proof by deforcing the body.

789
01:16:37,393 --> 01:16:39,342
So what should I do, tell me.

790
01:16:45,302 --> 01:16:48,149
I'm there, don't worry.

791
01:16:59,382 --> 01:17:02,093
Hi Aryan.

But who will explain this heart.

798
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,303

799
01:17:18,368 --> 01:17:20,282
Come on give me a kiss fast.

800
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:24,621

811
01:18:06,717 --> 01:18:13,506
She is not here,
maybe she gone to her family.

812
01:18:13,958 --> 01:18:16,441
But there is nobody in her family.

813
01:18:17,461 --> 01:18:19,670
So she must have gone
to a different place.

814
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:22,977
Yesterday itself she took a job
transfer by giving and application.

815
01:18:23,167 --> 01:18:25,707

Hello, this is so good my love,

820
01:18:44,189 --> 01:18:47,901
Aryan, there was a call
from nurse association""

821
01:18:48,426 --> 01:18:50,338
...and they were asking for Anny.

822
01:18:50,862 --> 01:18:52,399
Did you do any mistake while talking?

823
01:18:52,496 --> 01:18:55,070
No, but they said they
will phone up again..

824
01:18:55,166 --> 01:18:56,773
...and maybe they

Yes.

827

Why are you learning kick boxing?

828
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:14,527
May be it will help
me sometime in my life.

829
01:19:15,953 --> 01:19:20,839
Should I ask you one thing,
why do you girls attract men..

830
01:19:21,193 --> 01:19:26,945
...more by their beauty
and not by their brains?

831
01:19:28,166 --> 01:19:33,416
Because we know that
boys are foolish not blind.

832
01:19:34,907 --> 01:19:36,582
You naughty girl.

833
01:20:09,542 --> 01:20:15,362
""The story of the heart
is of two words.""

834
01:20:15,682 --> 01:20:21,330

""Either it is love or youth.""

839
01:21:16,977 --> 01:21:23,058
""Don't ask me the meaning

840
01:21:23,116 --> 01:21:28,800
""Don't ask me anything now.""

841
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:34,944

01:23:59,976 --> 01:24:01,547
Come on.

869
01:24:02,545 --> 01:24:05,324
Till when are we
going to hide the truth.

870
01:24:06,482 --> 01:24:09,933
Except we two there is a
third person who knows the truth.

871
01:24:11,253 --> 01:24:13,531
But instead of sending
this VCD to police..

872
01:24:13,622 --> 01:24:15,764
...why did that person has
sent this to us, what does that mean?

873
01:24:18,461 --> 01:24:20,410
May be blackmailing.

874
01:24:21,363 --> 01:24:23,710
So that person by itself will come.

875
01:24:23,767 --> 01:24:26,113
Till that time we will be quite.

876
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:33,890
Nikita, you should tomorrow
itself get a checkup done..

877
01:24:34,077 --> 01:24:35,923
...and I want you complete check up.

878
01:24:36,013 --> 01:24:38,894
I want to cure your disease.

879
01:24:44,688 --> 01:24:47,467
When is test report coming?

880
01:24:48,291 --> 01:24:49,396
Today evening it is going to come.

881
01:24:49,459 --> 01:24:50,906
What is the need of a report.

882
01:24:50,994 --> 01:24:53,705
...I'm telling you that
you are absolutely all right.

883
01:24:53,764 --> 01:24:57,806
Ya.. really, then we have a reason,
we should celebrate.

884
01:24:58,068 --> 01:25:00,813
So we'll go to the disco today.
- Yes.

885
01:25:03,006 --> 01:25:05,579
Should I wear the pink dress?
Your favorite.

886
01:25:08,178 --> 01:25:11,857
Thank you, you have given
a new life to my Nikita.

887
01:25:13,383 --> 01:25:18,463
Or else who would marry
such a girl without any sex life.

888
01:25:19,290 --> 01:25:22,001
There is not just
one meaning of marriage.

889
01:25:22,692 --> 01:25:25,505
When did you come to
know about Nikita's disease?

890
01:25:26,331 --> 01:25:29,474
During her childhood she use
to stay in India with her parents.

891
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,580
...and she use to get
attacks at that time as well.

892
01:25:33,638 --> 01:25:35,916
Happiness, sadness or angry.

893
01:25:37,242 --> 01:25:40,384
She used to get attack if she
used to get excited about anything.

894
01:25:41,546 --> 01:25:44,189
Her parents died in an accident.

895
01:25:46,049 --> 01:25:47,496
Then she came here.

896
01:25:48,519 --> 01:25:51,435
That time all of a sudden we came to
know that there is a hole in her heart.

897
01:25:52,557 --> 01:25:54,469
So when did you start her treatment?

898
01:25:54,793 --> 01:25:59,007
We did her treatment many times
but every time it was unsuccessful.

899
01:25:59,665 --> 01:26:02,774
Two months back we got
a surgery done in America.

900
01:26:03,467 --> 01:26:04,914
It was successful.

901
01:26:05,404 --> 01:26:09,686
Doctor said that she needs to be kept
under observation for three month.

902
01:26:11,042 --> 01:26:12,317
Then what happen?

903
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:15,361
Then what, you came into our life's..

904
01:26:15,779 --> 01:26:17,693
...and I didn't want to loose you.

905
01:26:18,716 --> 01:26:22,965
And that why going against
the doctor I married her to you.

906
01:26:23,255 --> 01:26:24,564
Thanks.

907
01:26:25,156 --> 01:26:26,967
Just take care of her for few days.

908
01:26:27,726 --> 01:26:30,106
Make sure she does not
gets excite for anything.

909
01:26:30,195 --> 01:26:33,442
Aryan.. Aryan..
- I'll go and check.

910
01:26:37,201 --> 01:26:39,684
Nikita"" Nikita""

911
01:26:43,642 --> 01:26:44,883
Nikita why did you burn this?

912
01:26:46,145 --> 01:26:49,356
I did not burn this,
Aryan I was inside.

913
01:26:49,415 --> 01:26:53,629
I did not burn this, this must be...

914
01:26:53,686 --> 01:26:55,827
So who did this?

915
01:26:55,888 --> 01:26:58,598
She only must have done it.

916
01:26:58,691 --> 01:27:00,103
Who?

917
01:27:00,359 --> 01:27:02,807
Anny, did this.

918
01:27:02,894 --> 01:27:04,101
She is already dead.

919
01:27:04,162 --> 01:27:08,445
But Aryan her spirit must be here,
because she was murdered.

920
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,641
But what's her connection
with your dress?

921
01:27:10,736 --> 01:27:17,489
Because I also had burnt her dress,
so she did it today...

922
01:27:18,444 --> 01:27:21,223
My love this is just a coincidence.

923
01:27:22,147 --> 01:27:26,623
Forget everything and wear any dress.

924
01:27:27,119 --> 01:27:30,935
What should I wear now? Your
favorite color dress is burnt now.

925
01:27:31,257 --> 01:27:37,112
You look great in blue, better in red,
and best in bed.

926
01:28:03,723 --> 01:28:05,727
What happen darling
why did you stop the car?

927
01:28:06,025 --> 01:28:08,406
I think the tyre is punctured,
let me check.

928
01:28:08,461 --> 01:28:09,566
<i>Okay'</i>

929
01:28:23,309 --> 01:28:24,688
What happen?

930
01:28:25,379 --> 01:28:27,223
What happen?

931
01:28:28,581 --> 01:28:30,153
That...

932
01:28:30,618 --> 01:28:32,622
Now don't tell this
again that you saw Anny.

933
01:28:33,353 --> 01:28:36,064
Aryan, I am telling you...

934
01:28:38,424 --> 01:28:42,707
She was Anny.
- Where?

935
01:28:42,763 --> 01:28:47,717
Aryan she was on the back seat.
- Dear.

936
01:28:47,768 --> 01:28:51,275
Baby, there's nobody there.
What nonsense, it's okay..

937
01:28:51,504 --> 01:28:56,618
...It's okay, I'm telling you,
cool down, nobody there.

938
01:28:57,945 --> 01:28:59,483
I'll come right now.

939
01:29:25,739 --> 01:29:28,313
Should I ask one thing?

940
01:29:29,777 --> 01:29:30,917
Okay ask.

941
01:29:31,279 --> 01:29:32,657
You won't get angry.

942
01:29:34,948 --> 01:29:36,224
No.

943
01:29:37,184 --> 01:29:41,398
We can see the spirits
only during the night time?

944
01:29:42,489 --> 01:29:44,972
This spirit talks are all bullshit.

945
01:29:45,927 --> 01:29:48,604
But Anny is always seen in the night.

946
01:29:48,663 --> 01:29:49,835
She is dead.

947
01:29:54,001 --> 01:29:55,242
Sorry.

948
01:29:57,338 --> 01:29:59,719
Look you are an educated girl.

949
01:30:00,541 --> 01:30:02,182
You should understand one thing""

950
01:30:02,844 --> 01:30:05,156
""that there is no spiritual
power and its all imagination.

951
01:30:05,246 --> 01:30:08,196
But Aryan I saw Anny from my own eyes.

952
01:30:09,684 --> 01:30:12,258
So when I came where did she go?

953
01:30:12,554 --> 01:30:15,469
She vanished, she is a spirit
she can go anywhere she wants.

954
01:30:15,790 --> 01:30:17,237
It's not their house..

955
01:30:17,459 --> 01:30:21,275
...whenever they want
they come and go, idiot.

956
01:30:21,829 --> 01:30:25,336
If she is seen again then?

957
01:30:26,501 --> 01:30:27,981
Catch her.

958
01:30:30,338 --> 01:30:34,119
But to catch her I have to touch
her and If I touch her I'll be dead.

959
01:30:34,176 --> 01:30:35,281
Shut up!

960
01:30:36,846 --> 01:30:41,526
Grandpa said this.

961
01:30:42,084 --> 01:30:49,738
From today onwards put one thing
in your mind, heart that is Aryan.

962
01:30:50,493 --> 01:30:55,572
After that you'll
see only me everywhere.

963
01:30:56,431 --> 01:30:58,845
<i>Okay-
_ Okay</i>

964
01:31:00,570 --> 01:31:01,982
My baby.

965
01:31:03,071 --> 01:31:09,791
Grandpa, are spirits very powerful?
- Yes.

966
01:31:13,282 --> 01:31:16,458
So they stay at one place
or they can go anywhere?

967
01:31:16,518 --> 01:31:18,501
Who can stop them?

968
01:31:20,623 --> 01:31:23,630
Then tell me one thing
that they attack people..

969
01:31:23,692 --> 01:31:27,233
...with whom they want
to take revenge or anybody.

970
01:31:27,497 --> 01:31:29,409
With whom they want to take revenge..

971
01:31:29,498 --> 01:31:31,104
...but dear why are you
asking all these things?

972
01:31:32,468 --> 01:31:34,176
Just like that.

973
01:31:36,072 --> 01:31:39,784
Why is there so much qaos,
dear see what's happening?

974
01:31:40,543 --> 01:31:42,046
I'll see and come.
- Okay.

975
01:32:25,756 --> 01:32:27,032
Excuse me.

976
01:32:28,658 --> 01:32:29,831
You.

977
01:32:30,226 --> 01:32:33,233
Her dead body is not here.
- Who's?

978
01:32:33,464 --> 01:32:34,808
The person you are trying to find out.

979
01:32:35,398 --> 01:32:37,608
Who told you that
I'm searching somebody?

980
01:32:38,034 --> 01:32:41,850
In so much crowd nobody else,
but only you have seen that dead body.

981
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:45,451
Actually I..
- Is anybody is missing?

982
01:32:45,975 --> 01:32:47,285
Yes.
- Who is that?

983
01:32:47,344 --> 01:32:50,021
My nurse.
- From how many days?

984
01:32:50,847 --> 01:32:54,424
Only from last 15 days.
- Did you file a missing report?

985
01:32:55,252 --> 01:32:56,995
Not right now because...
- Why not?

986
01:32:57,054 --> 01:33:00,129
I thought she'll come
back early that why...

987
01:33:00,224 --> 01:33:02,137
Where she has gone
did you find out there?

988
01:33:02,192 --> 01:33:04,196
No, I don't have the number.

989
01:33:06,363 --> 01:33:08,038
But who are you to
ask me all these questions?

990
01:33:08,132 --> 01:33:09,977
Inspector Khan, Kadar Khan.

991
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:14,820
Because this case is under me,
where do you stay?

992
01:33:16,073 --> 01:33:18,055
Long street, bungalow no. 5.

993
01:33:18,109 --> 01:33:19,681
I'll call you when required.

994
01:33:20,277 --> 01:33:21,382
<i>Okay'</i>

995
01:33:37,428 --> 01:33:38,464
Aryan..

996
01:34:26,111 --> 01:34:27,353
You.

997
01:34:29,181 --> 01:34:31,060
So late in the night
what are you doing here.

998
01:34:31,550 --> 01:34:33,862
And now don't tell
me that you saw Anny.

999
01:34:37,090 --> 01:34:39,002
But what are you doing
so late night here?

1000
01:34:39,992 --> 01:34:43,305
Was not getting sleep
so to smoke I came downstairs.

1001
01:34:44,196 --> 01:34:49,241
If I would smoke there it
would be a problem for you, let's go.

1002
01:34:57,710 --> 01:34:59,657
Sorry I came without calling you up.

1003
01:35:00,146 --> 01:35:02,720
As I did not have your number.

1004
01:35:04,516 --> 01:35:07,125
Anyways is this your card,
it yours right.

1005
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:09,062
So.

1006
01:35:09,155 --> 01:35:12,105
Your name and address
is written on this.

1007
01:35:12,992 --> 01:35:15,975
That's why the stuff
in the bag has to be yours.

1008
01:35:16,362 --> 01:35:17,638
Which stuff?

1009
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:20,942
Come with me I'll show you.

1010
01:35:30,577 --> 01:35:32,855
Things inside this
bag have to be yours.

1011
01:35:34,513 --> 01:35:35,960
Check and see.

1012
01:35:36,582 --> 01:35:37,995
Go check.

1013
01:35:44,190 --> 01:35:45,535
Open it.

1014
01:36:05,612 --> 01:36:08,494
Inspector what kind of joke is this?
- I finding for clues.

1015
01:36:09,616 --> 01:36:11,461
And from your house nurse is missing.

1016
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:17,764
And there was a suitcase near
the lake with a dead body of a lady.

1017
01:36:18,625 --> 01:36:21,872
So?
- That's it I'm leaving.

1018
01:36:23,864 --> 01:36:26,643
Thanks. I took your
jack five-six days before.

1019
01:36:27,166 --> 01:36:29,446
Anyways your nurse is also
missing from past five-six days.

1020
01:36:36,076 --> 01:36:37,318
Okay bye.

1021
01:36:44,619 --> 01:36:47,967
Grandpa, the season
has changed all of a sudden.

1022
01:36:48,222 --> 01:36:50,602
Yes, the seasons as
well as people change.

1023
01:36:51,191 --> 01:36:53,002
Where is Nikita?
- She is inside.

1024
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:54,664
Inside, okay I'll come.

1025
01:36:59,032 --> 01:37:00,035
Nikita.

1026
01:37:03,871 --> 01:37:05,648
Grandpa,
the atmosphere is so good today.

1027
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:08,120
If you get wet in
the rain you'll fall ill.

1028
01:37:08,208 --> 01:37:10,054
Still you are acting like a kid.

1029
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:12,889
You are here and Aryan
went to search you inside.

1030
01:37:12,948 --> 01:37:14,519
<i>Okay'</i>

1031
01:37:15,016 --> 01:37:18,363
Aryan..
- This kids are too much.

1032
01:37:20,688 --> 01:37:23,934
Nikita.
- I'm here. What happen?

1033
01:37:24,125 --> 01:37:26,072
So the lady inside
the room who is she?

1034
01:37:27,996 --> 01:37:34,248
See Aryan didn't I tell you
that one day you'll also see Anny.

1035
01:37:35,170 --> 01:37:40,922
No Aryan lets go from here,
we'll leave this house.

1036
01:37:40,976 --> 01:37:43,289
Please, we'll leave this house.

1037
01:37:43,378 --> 01:37:44,722
Please Aryan.

1038
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:47,730
What will we say
to people and grandpa?

1039
01:37:47,816 --> 01:37:52,496
Tell anything to grandpa.
What should I tell you Aryan?

1040
01:37:52,587 --> 01:37:55,696
She will kill me,

1041
01:37:55,790 --> 01:37:58,831
...and I'm really scared please.
I'm really scared.

1042
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:01,976
Nikita.
- I'm really scared please.

1043
01:38:02,697 --> 01:38:06,478
Aryan please,
I want to live and don't want to die.

1044
01:38:06,567 --> 01:38:09,073
Aryan, I want to live.

1045
01:38:10,138 --> 01:38:12,279
Aryan, I want to live.
- No, don't worry Nikita.

1046
01:38:13,209 --> 01:38:17,662
Hello. What are you talking about,

1047
01:38:22,917 --> 01:38:25,730
Hold this. Everything will be fine

01:38:28,723 --> 01:38:32,264
Now go off to sleep,
I have given grandpa the tablet.

1049
01:38:32,594 --> 01:38:38,073
Oh god, I already gave him the
sleeping tablet and you gave it again.

1050
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:42,814
Don't worry, no problem.
Grandpa will sleep for one more hour.

1051
01:38:47,042 --> 01:38:48,488
One minute.

1052
01:38:50,379 --> 01:38:56,063
Hello, yes this is doctor Aryan.

1053
01:38:59,356 --> 01:39:00,995

1054
01:39:02,758 --> 01:39:04,968
I told you, I can't come this time.

1055
01:39:08,831 --> 01:39:10,607
What should I do if
there is an emergency?

1056
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:12,308
Hold on.

1057
01:39:12,668 --> 01:39:17,052

1058
01:39:17,207 --> 01:39:18,744

1061
01:39:25,182 --> 01:39:26,423
Again the same thing.

01:39:26,749 --> 01:39:30,633
Look Aryan you also saw her right,

01:39:34,224 --> 01:39:36,570
...It's the matter of somebodies life.

1065
01:39:36,759 --> 01:39:38,741
She will kill me.

01:39:40,397 --> 01:39:44,247

1068
01:39:47,237 --> 01:39:49,241

Hello, yes I'm about to reach.

Anny.
- Keep the door open I'm coming.

1093
01:42:21,626 --> 01:42:23,336
Have I gone mad.

1094
01:42:26,199 --> 01:42:28,647
No. No.

1095
01:42:32,204 --> 01:42:33,947
I'll switch off the phone.

1096
01:42:37,009 --> 01:42:39,355
Aryan.

1097
01:42:41,214 --> 01:42:43,092
Aryan.
- Who Aryan?

1098
01:42:43,182 --> 01:42:46,793
Keep the door open I'm coming.

1099
01:43:07,272 --> 01:43:09,016
Why is she not answering the phone?

1100
01:43:14,715 --> 01:43:16,320
Oh my god what happen?

1101
01:43:38,604 --> 01:43:39,914
Light.

1102
01:43:41,608 --> 01:43:43,179
Oh god!

1103
01:43:44,844 --> 01:43:46,553
There is no electricity.

1104
01:49:18,517 --> 01:49:24,734
No, I'll die Anny, please
leave me and don't come near me.

1105
01:49:24,823 --> 01:49:26,895
Please Anny I'll die.

1106
01:49:28,927 --> 01:49:32,571
No, please leave me.

1107
01:49:35,266 --> 01:49:38,740
No, I'll die.

1108
01:49:39,804 --> 01:49:42,845
No, I'll die.

1109
01:49:43,775 --> 01:49:45,654
No. No.

1110
01:50:21,013 --> 01:50:22,722
Is she dead?
- Yes.

1111
01:50:25,084 --> 01:50:26,223
First check.

1112
01:50:35,328 --> 01:50:38,972
Yes she is gone up, dead bitch.

1113
01:50:44,737 --> 01:50:46,685
Thing happened as I planned.

1114
01:50:48,108 --> 01:50:51,752
You did an excellent job my spirit.

1115
01:50:51,811 --> 01:50:54,225
You did an excellent job.

1116
01:50:54,313 --> 01:50:57,925
That means you never did
any mistake by leaving me alive.

1117
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:05,340
Trying double cross me.

1118
01:51:06,292 --> 01:51:07,865
Don't kill me.

1119
01:51:08,361 --> 01:51:09,932
Why shouldn't I kill you?

1120
01:51:09,996 --> 01:51:11,874
May be I can be of your some help.

1121
01:51:12,299 --> 01:51:14,007
Of what work you'll be for me?

1122
01:51:14,199 --> 01:51:17,582
See Aryan,
you'll not get anything by killing..

1123
01:51:17,805 --> 01:51:19,479
...but Nikita's death
will surely help you.

1124
01:51:20,273 --> 01:51:25,057
Okay so you'll do
whatever I'll tell you.

1125
01:51:25,112 --> 01:51:26,956
Yes.

1126
01:51:27,447 --> 01:51:29,987
From today onwards
I'll play a new game.

1127
01:51:30,317 --> 01:51:33,825
If you show any smartness
then you had it, understood.

1128
01:51:34,354 --> 01:51:36,097
No.

1129
01:51:37,623 --> 01:51:39,867
And you also did the
same thing what I said.

1130
01:51:40,594 --> 01:51:44,273
After all the heart patient is
dead because of you a natural death.

1131
01:51:47,067 --> 01:51:53,423
Now everything is mine.

1132
01:51:54,441 --> 01:51:55,750
But what will happen to grandpa?

1133
01:51:59,446 --> 01:52:01,394
He will die with this news.

1134
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:07,327
If he does not die I'll kill him
by my master plan how Nikita died..

1135
01:52:07,688 --> 01:52:09,169
...I will kill him.

1136
01:52:10,323 --> 01:52:11,668
Good.

1137
01:52:13,226 --> 01:52:14,731
What next?

1138
01:52:15,796 --> 01:52:20,443
Wrong question,
not what next, who next?

1139
01:52:20,701 --> 01:52:21,841
What do you mean?

1140
01:52:22,036 --> 01:52:26,182
It means she is dead
and behind her who will go.

1141
01:52:30,244 --> 01:52:31,850
You'll go, dear.

1142
01:52:35,516 --> 01:52:39,765
When you are alive you helped
me a lot, now die and show me.

1143
01:52:40,854 --> 01:52:42,301
But why?

1144
01:52:44,959 --> 01:52:53,318
Because I'm a doctor and I
do operations, I don't leave any clue.

1145
01:52:53,367 --> 01:53:01,818
I knew it selfish men
like you will never change.

1146
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:07,018
That's why I got the police with me.

1147
01:53:07,081 --> 01:53:08,584
You did a very good thing.

1148
01:53:11,085 --> 01:53:15,630
Now they'll their selves see what have
you done for taking your revenge..

1149
01:53:16,724 --> 01:53:18,933
...first you had spread
a rumour that you are missing..

1150
01:53:20,930 --> 01:53:26,681
...and now you came
here and killed Nikita.

1151
01:53:28,638 --> 01:53:33,057
You killed Nikita,
right then, I came here.

1152
01:53:34,843 --> 01:53:37,417
I tried to stop you..

1153
01:53:41,384 --> 01:53:46,929
You counter attacked me and
got killed doing self-defense.

1154
01:54:00,169 --> 01:54:01,514
You did not die?

1155
01:54:01,570 --> 01:54:06,547
No, what you thought
that I'm a heart patient..

1156
01:54:06,643 --> 01:54:09,559
...and you'll torture me,
scare me and I'll die.

1157
01:54:10,178 --> 01:54:12,161
So you are not a heart patient?

1158
01:54:12,447 --> 01:54:15,864
Yes I'm, but when a
doctor becomes a villain..

1159
01:54:16,084 --> 01:54:18,066
...then the nurse has to do her work.

1160
01:54:23,258 --> 01:54:29,307
After knowing your dirty
nature she being you wife..

1161
01:54:29,365 --> 01:54:32,406
...was helping you and
hiding your mistakes.

1162
01:54:32,868 --> 01:54:37,619
...and leaving me alive
you did a very big mistake.

1163
01:54:39,475 --> 01:54:44,988
Anny spoilt your game right, after
her death she met me on the third day.

1164
01:54:48,584 --> 01:54:50,862
'My cell phone.
- I'll get you phone.'

1165
01:54:54,057 --> 01:54:56,130
Come out Anny.

1166
01:54:58,328 --> 01:55:00,139
And she told me truth.

1167
01:55:00,397 --> 01:55:02,845
If Anny wouldn't have
told me the truth..

1168
01:55:02,899 --> 01:55:06,372
...then you would have
succeeded in your plan.

1169
01:55:08,737 --> 01:55:12,849
You thought that you
are playing with both of us.

1170
01:55:16,746 --> 01:55:19,923
But the fact is that
we both are playing with you.

1171
01:55:21,718 --> 01:55:24,702
But you have a misunderstanding.

1172
01:55:25,156 --> 01:55:30,133
Misunderstanding,
yes come on tell me Aryan now..

1173
01:55:30,227 --> 01:55:37,983
...which drop of your blood
says that I love you Nikita""

1174
01:55:38,235 --> 01:55:41,583
""get up and say.

1175
01:55:41,638 --> 01:55:45,180
Think if grandpa comes
to know about this.

1176
01:55:45,276 --> 01:55:47,349
Grandpa will not come
to know about anything"".

1177
01:55:47,411 --> 01:55:50,122
...he will not get any shock.

1178
01:55:50,180 --> 01:55:53,426
And the drama which you
are doing its been getting""

1179
01:55:53,483 --> 01:55:56,400
""shot by five cameras
do you understand?

1180
01:55:59,990 --> 01:56:01,665
Grandpa will be very
happy by seeing this scene.

1181
01:56:01,858 --> 01:56:04,432
Come on now start getting
ready for going to the jail.

1182
01:56:08,398 --> 01:56:10,573
If you are saved then...

1183
01:56:11,502 --> 01:56:13,005
No.

1184
01:56:13,805 --> 01:56:16,914
Come kill me.

1185
01:56:32,224 --> 01:56:35,469
Backstabbed me? Not fair.

1186
01:56:42,767 --> 01:56:49,157
Everything is fair in love and war.

1187
01:56:49,207 --> 01:56:50,744
Know about this war.

1188
01:57:04,589 --> 01:57:05,933
Come.

1189
01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:10,066
Grandpa.

1190
01:57:10,162 --> 01:57:12,475
No dear silence.

1191
01:57:20,205 --> 01:57:23,348
Grandpa.
- Come dear.

1192
01:57:23,441 --> 01:57:26,983
Don't worry now nothing will happen.

1193
01:57:57,910 --> 01:57:59,414
See that.

1194
01:58:08,789 --> 01:58:10,531
Grandpa.

1195
01:58:13,593 --> 01:58:16,235
Now what again got an attack?

1196
01:58:16,295 --> 01:58:19,472
After playing such a hot
song if two girls take bath""

1197
01:58:19,531 --> 01:58:21,274
...then anybody will get an attack.

1198
01:58:21,367 --> 01:58:23,508
So should play any old song.

1199
01:58:23,570 --> 01:58:25,073
Yes.

1200
01:58:25,271 --> 01:58:29,052
Grandpa's favorite..
or else play that.

1201
01:58:29,108 --> 01:58:30,087
That one.

1202
01:58:30,176 --> 01:58:31,247
Yeah.

1203
01:58:31,310 --> 01:58:39,704
""I'm writing a story
of my restless heart.""

1204
01:58:39,751 --> 01:58:44,763
""With the colors of
your wait in my eyes.""

1205
01:58:45,024 --> 01:58:50,001
Wow what an amazing song she has sung,
and she looked fabulous.

1206
01:58:50,096 --> 01:58:52,875
Yes grandpa, she had become so fat.

1207
01:58:53,900 --> 01:58:57,113
So what still she was good that time.

1208
01:58:59,439 --> 01:59:03,288
""I'm writing a story.""

1209
01:59:13,386 --> 01:59:21,677
""When you are not around,
there's no fun in Spring season.""

1210
01:59:27,501 --> 01:59:35,758
""When you are not around,
there's no fun in Spring season.""

1211
01:59:36,008 --> 01:59:44,733
""I wish not to see the Spring season.""

1212
01:59:44,819 --> 01:59:49,967
""With the colors of
your wait in my eyes.""

1213
01:59:50,223 --> 01:59:53,673
""I'm writing a story.""

1214
02:00:15,650 --> 02:00:23,976
""I have the luxuries of the world.""

1215
02:00:29,830 --> 02:00:38,122
""I have the luxuries of the world.""

1216
02:00:38,206 --> 02:00:44,686
""But the destiny has..""

00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:50,824
Gidde, I'll tell you a joke. Listen.

2
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:54,648
A furious tiger is
passing through a jungle.

3
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,797
He spots a rabbit.

4
00:00:56,877 --> 00:00:58,122
He catches the rabbit and says..

5
00:00:58,202 --> 00:01:00,270
..who is the king of this jungle?

6
00:01:01,202 --> 00:01:04,040
The rabbit says, you are, my lord.

7
00:01:04,824 --> 00:01:09,419
Then he moves on with full pride.

8
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:12,487
He spots a jackal.
He catches the jackal and asks.

9
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:14,514
Who is the king of this jungle?

10
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,919
You are, lord! He says the same thing.

11
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:19,947
He asks all along the way
until he gets to an elephant.

12
00:01:20,027 --> 00:01:22,730
He says who is the king of this jungle?

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,419
The elephant says,
go away or I will crush you.

14
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:31,432
He doesn't give up. Once again he asks,
who is the king of this jungle?

15
00:01:31,512 --> 00:01:36,743
This is my last warning to you.
Go away or I will crush you.

16
00:01:36,823 --> 00:01:39,798
Listen to me.
Wait. Why are you telling the joke?

17
00:01:39,878 --> 00:01:41,460
I am telling the joke.

18
00:01:41,946 --> 00:01:43,392
He asks for the third time.

19
00:01:43,472 --> 00:01:45,541
He turns around and hits him.

20
00:01:45,932 --> 00:01:47,811
He is hurt.

21
00:01:48,284 --> 00:01:53,324
Mom! Dad! And he limps back home slowly.

22
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:56,283
Then he goes back to the start.
The rabbit.

23
00:01:56,363 --> 00:01:59,256
He sees the rabbit.
He catches him and asks.

24
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:02,378
If you don't know you should say so.

25
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:06,284
You don't get it?

26
00:02:06,635 --> 00:02:09,446
What kind of a man are you? Crazy fool.

27
00:02:09,526 --> 00:02:11,729
Who repeats such long jokes?

28
00:02:27,257 --> 00:02:28,568
Get down.

29
00:02:29,771 --> 00:02:31,446
Get down, everybody.

30
00:02:34,662 --> 00:02:37,811
Go sit over there. Next to that tree.

31
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,487
Next to that tree.

32
00:02:43,811 --> 00:02:45,311
Hurry up.

33
00:02:46,838 --> 00:02:49,419
Not there. Behind. Behind.

34
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:09,041
Thanks, Babu.

35
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,542
Water.

36
00:03:41,028 --> 00:03:43,231
I urinated in it last night.

37
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:57,839
You're staring? You dare to stare at me?

38
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:01,839
If you stare I will hit you!

39
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,772
If I punch you once you
will come to your senses.

40
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:11,717
I am not hitting you
because you are an investment.

41
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:19,150
Not from that side,
but I will hit you from this side.

42
00:04:20,582 --> 00:04:22,987
Scoundrel!

43
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:31,568
Everybody, listen.

44
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:34,838
There are only two
huge things in Hyderabad.

45
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:41,257
One is the Charminar and
the other is Chinna's prick ????.

46
00:05:07,987 --> 00:05:09,595
Hello, brother.

47
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:12,378
Why did you bring them in a lorry?

48
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:14,784
The new policeman
wouldn't accept a bribe.

49
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:15,918
Three checkpoints have been increased.

50
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:18,851
I had to come 100 kilometres
through the jungle.

51
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:22,121
You can't do anything properly.

52
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:25,756
Can't do with you, can't do without you.

53
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,852
Have you lost your mind?

54
00:05:50,298 --> 00:05:52,014
She is a small child.

55
00:05:53,838 --> 00:05:56,027
Don't you know the
rules of the business?

56
00:06:01,838 --> 00:06:02,986
Go.

57
00:06:03,662 --> 00:06:05,149
Get in the first car.

58
00:06:06,987 --> 00:06:08,744
I want to go with them.

59
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:11,703
The place where they're
going is not a good place.

60
00:06:12,596 --> 00:06:13,933
Get in the car.

61
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,933
Take the others.

62
00:06:32,123 --> 00:06:35,528
Let's go. The picnic is over. Come on.

63
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,435
Let's go. Hurry.

64
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:47,029
Come on.

65
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:07,488
From which village do you come, child?

66
00:07:08,717 --> 00:07:10,123
Ibrahimpatna.

67
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,123
Who do you have in your family?

68
00:07:19,678 --> 00:07:21,556
My father and two sisters.

69
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:23,880
Saraswati and Parvati.

70
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:34,367
Who is it?

71
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,867
Lakshmi. Get up.

72
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,029
Feed her and put her to bed.

73
00:07:58,259 --> 00:07:59,786
It has been a bad day.

74
00:08:04,394 --> 00:08:10,259
""Listen, silly girl, pray for yourself.""

75
00:08:10,475 --> 00:08:13,286
""You have nobody.""

76
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:19,745
""The one whom who
think is your saviour..""

77
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:22,164
""..is not yours.""

78
00:08:23,474 --> 00:08:25,393
""The body is your room..""

79
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:28,109
""..and the mind is your house.""

80
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:32,812
""Your breaths are your toys.""

81
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:37,569
""Stuff the sun in your hair and walk.""

82
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:42,379
""You will not find any night.""

83
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:48,096
""Listen, silly girl, pray for yourself.""

84
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,417
""You have nobody.""

85
00:09:05,016 --> 00:09:06,108
Drink milk.

86
00:09:13,632 --> 00:09:15,383
Scrub your body when bathing.

87
00:09:15,463 --> 00:09:16,464
When the dirt comes off..

88
00:09:16,544 --> 00:09:19,275
..the pretty Lakshmi within will emerge.

89
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:21,772
My mother used to say
the same thing, ma'am.

90
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:24,972
Reddy Garu will get
you new clothes tomorrow.

91
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:29,274
Reddy Garu is very nice,
isn't he, ma'am?

92
00:09:29,793 --> 00:09:30,820
Even yesterday he..

93
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,366
Talk later! Have a bath first
or the water will become cold.

94
00:09:47,868 --> 00:09:49,176
Reddy Garu..

95
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:53,035
..may I live here? I will do your work.

96
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,938
I shall help ma'am.

97
00:09:55,154 --> 00:09:57,316
The fish curry was prepared by her.

98
00:09:59,457 --> 00:10:00,647
Okay.

99
00:10:07,424 --> 00:10:08,592
It is good.

100
00:10:28,235 --> 00:10:29,446
This week's..

101
00:10:37,586 --> 00:10:39,726
Don't stare. Eat.

102
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,527
Thank you, brother.

103
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:02,797
Eat slowly.

104
00:11:05,424 --> 00:11:07,197
Show some respect for the fish.

105
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,003
Yes, brother.

106
00:11:11,316 --> 00:11:13,143
What is this dressing?

107
00:11:16,191 --> 00:11:17,651
It is in fashion, brother.

108
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:19,673
What have you worn?

109
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:22,872
When will you trim your beard?

110
00:11:26,322 --> 00:11:28,073
You look like a goat.

111
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:35,262
May I eat a little, brother?

112
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:41,803
I am not afraid of injections.

113
00:11:41,883 --> 00:11:43,122
This one is very good.

114
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:46,354
You see the white marks.
It is due to vitamin deficiency.

115
00:11:47,046 --> 00:11:49,079
As it is you are very weak.

116
00:11:49,327 --> 00:11:51,078
This injection is for energy.

117
00:12:00,776 --> 00:12:02,959
Don't ruin it. Let it dry.

118
00:12:03,662 --> 00:12:05,446
It is such a horrible design.

119
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:07,359
This was the design at my wedding too.

120
00:12:08,235 --> 00:12:09,997
Who liked this horrible design?

121
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:11,597
My husband.

122
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:16,970
Ma'am, where is your husband? He died?

123
00:12:18,246 --> 00:12:20,095
I wish he were dead. I'd be better off.

124
00:12:20,398 --> 00:12:23,252
Ma'am, you should speak
respectably about your husband.

125
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,971
What are you applying?

126
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,608
It is horrible.

127
00:12:32,225 --> 00:12:33,252
Stand.

128
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,636
Sorry, Reddy Garu.
I won't apply henna hereafter.

129
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:10,301
I will only work all day long,
Reddy Garu.

130
00:13:11,036 --> 00:13:12,160
Sit.

131
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:13,457
Sorry.

132
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:15,900
Sit.
- Sorry, Reddy Garu.

133
00:13:16,138 --> 00:13:17,262
Sit!

134
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:31,814
Sorry, Reddy Garu. I made a mistake.

135
00:13:32,928 --> 00:13:34,431
I won't do it again.

136
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,749
Reddy Garu..

137
00:14:05,663 --> 00:14:06,830
Sorry.

138
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,922
Quiet!
- Forgive me.

139
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,862
I won't do again.

140
00:14:22,506 --> 00:14:23,987
Put your hands up.

141
00:14:24,225 --> 00:14:25,447
Sorry.

142
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:28,744
Put your hands up.

143
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,127
Up!

144
00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:53,175
I won't do it.

145
00:14:54,288 --> 00:14:55,823
Forgive me.

146
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:23,079
""Listen, Sugna.""

147
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:29,954
""Wearing silver anklets on your ankles.""

148
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:35,889
""Take your mother's blessings with you.""

149
00:15:46,105 --> 00:15:48,268
""Listen, Sugna.""

150
00:15:50,397 --> 00:15:55,500
""Wear the veil of your mother's house.""

151
00:15:57,186 --> 00:16:02,516
""Go and settle in
your husband's village.""

152
00:16:07,445 --> 00:16:18,083
""Smile with the henna on your hands.""

153
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:25,748
""Wearing your beau's
ring on your finger.""

154
00:16:25,828 --> 00:16:32,202
""And hum a song.""

155
00:16:32,397 --> 00:16:33,792
You knew.

156
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:35,954
You knew right from the start.

157
00:16:39,273 --> 00:16:42,236
""Listen, Sugna.""

158
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,214
""Wearing silver anklets on your ankles.""

159
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,868
""Take your mother's blessings with you.""

160
00:17:14,237 --> 00:17:20,204
""Abandon all the household chores.""

161
00:17:20,897 --> 00:17:24,465
""I shall help you cross the Ganges.""

162
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:27,643
""I shall help you cross the Ganges.""

163
00:17:27,723 --> 00:17:33,039
""You will have an adoring
husband all your life.""

164
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:40,574
""I will help you make up with God.""

165
00:17:41,104 --> 00:17:45,039
""I will help you make up with God.""

166
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:48,659
Why don't you understand? Wait a minute.

167
00:17:51,395 --> 00:17:55,114
""Wearing silver anklets..""

168
00:17:56,315 --> 00:18:00,109
I've told you this joke so many times,
I am confused.

169
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:01,698
What did you not understand?

170
00:18:03,178 --> 00:18:04,908
You have the brain of an eggplant.

171
00:18:04,988 --> 00:18:07,449
Okay. The rabbit is first,
the hyena comes next.

172
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:08,638
Come along.

173
00:18:10,086 --> 00:18:11,859
And then the elephant.

174
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:17,708
Rascal, don't ask such questions, man!

175
00:18:18,162 --> 00:18:19,989
I shall tell you another easy joke.

176
00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:23,838
You know Mr.
Ahmed. There's a joke about him.

177
00:18:24,746 --> 00:18:26,314
Mr. Ahmed goes to London.

178
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:30,487
He desperately needs to
piss near the Queen's palace.

179
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:33,611
So he looks here and
there and finds a wall..

180
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:35,168
..and takes a leak at full speed.

181
00:18:35,362 --> 00:18:36,984
A policeman catches him.

182
00:18:37,502 --> 00:18:39,491
He fines him fifty pounds.

183
00:18:40,043 --> 00:18:42,237
From there he heads to New York.

184
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:45,265
Again in New York he needs to urinate.

185
00:18:46,551 --> 00:18:49,600
He feels like urinating time and again.

186
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:52,800
No.

187
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,010
Just a minute.

188
00:18:56,216 --> 00:18:57,210
Come on.

189
00:18:57,632 --> 00:18:58,908
Well, I have arrived.

190
00:18:59,665 --> 00:19:01,513
Not New York. Dharam Vilas.

191
00:19:01,593 --> 00:19:02,919
Talk to you later.

192
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:04,497
Hang up.

193
00:19:09,977 --> 00:19:11,220
Jyoti.

194
00:19:16,496 --> 00:19:17,664
New girl. Prepare her.

195
00:19:17,744 --> 00:19:18,831
Today?

196
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:20,994
No. At the next festival of lights.

197
00:19:21,307 --> 00:19:23,718
Meanwhile we shall
teach her to do things.

198
00:19:24,648 --> 00:19:27,264
If there is one day's delay,
it will come out of your salary.

199
00:19:30,432 --> 00:19:32,389
You are so fair.

200
00:19:34,896 --> 00:19:37,232
I am aroused. Who is alive?

201
00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:38,961
Seema. Let's go.

202
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:46,325
Come.

203
00:19:46,984 --> 00:19:48,195
What is your name?

204
00:19:49,795 --> 00:19:50,887
Lakshmi.

205
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,281
Lakshmi.

206
00:19:55,384 --> 00:19:56,476
Come.

207
00:19:56,908 --> 00:19:58,335
Look in front of you and walk.

208
00:20:04,854 --> 00:20:05,643
Come.

209
00:20:22,248 --> 00:20:24,215
This is your room. That is Suvarna.

210
00:20:24,295 --> 00:20:26,346
When she wakes up she
will explain everything to you.

211
00:20:26,703 --> 00:20:28,389
Get some sleep yourself.
You have to stay awake all night.

212
00:20:28,973 --> 00:20:30,486
Take that mat. Sleep.

213
00:21:14,551 --> 00:21:17,199
Your food is kept there. Eat it.

214
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,022
Suvarna, your mechanic is here.

215
00:21:46,584 --> 00:21:49,362
Send him to Priya, sister. That maggot!

216
00:21:49,848 --> 00:21:52,832
He doesn't bathe for weeks.
He stinks so much, it rots me.

217
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,583
You take him.

218
00:21:56,853 --> 00:21:59,350
Don't squander it.
It has to last the whole month.

219
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,188
Take it out of my income.

220
00:22:11,242 --> 00:22:12,107
Take this.

221
00:22:12,636 --> 00:22:13,728
Get ready.

222
00:22:14,247 --> 00:22:15,501
I am eating.

223
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,031
Yes, your highness.

224
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:30,669
This isn't your father's hotel.

225
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,372
Five minutes. Get ready quickly.

226
00:22:50,473 --> 00:22:52,106
Haven't you ever draped a sari before?

227
00:22:56,753 --> 00:22:57,824
Let it be.

228
00:22:58,592 --> 00:23:01,165
Slip it out quietly
when you get undressed.

229
00:23:02,862 --> 00:23:04,062
Hold it.

230
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,257
Sorry.

231
00:23:07,176 --> 00:23:08,917
Did I slap you hard?

232
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,922
One loses one's temper
very quickly in this business.

233
00:23:13,283 --> 00:23:14,970
But you will have to learn in time.

234
00:23:17,705 --> 00:23:18,840
Only one patron today.

235
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:22,418
As you get used to them
we shall increase them.

236
00:23:26,408 --> 00:23:29,510
What will he..?

237
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,516
He will shove it.

238
00:23:31,338 --> 00:23:32,473
But don't worry.

239
00:23:32,927 --> 00:23:34,743
He won't do any dirty things.

240
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:40,689
No, sister.
It hurt very much the last time.

241
00:23:44,354 --> 00:23:45,932
You are very pretty.

242
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:47,338
Sister..

243
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:50,343
The wound..

244
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:53,911
It still hurts.

245
00:23:55,327 --> 00:23:56,375
Show me.

246
00:23:58,408 --> 00:23:59,522
Show me.

247
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,419
It's nothing mysterious.
I have the same stuff as you.

248
00:24:05,047 --> 00:24:06,398
I shall help you. Show me.

249
00:24:06,582 --> 00:24:07,630
Raise the sari.

250
00:24:08,452 --> 00:24:09,490
Raise it.

251
00:24:16,312 --> 00:24:17,339
It is okay.

252
00:24:18,571 --> 00:24:19,987
Just a little swelling.

253
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,149
It heals faster at your age.

254
00:24:25,879 --> 00:24:26,906
Apply this.

255
00:24:27,447 --> 00:24:30,031
It will slide in easily.
And it will hurt less.

256
00:24:32,236 --> 00:24:33,587
You will go to hell.

257
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:37,879
That's what this is, my dear.

258
00:24:44,488 --> 00:24:46,715
If she says you aren't
using this condom..

259
00:24:46,795 --> 00:24:48,477
..I won't give you a girl next time.

260
00:24:49,007 --> 00:24:50,499
I am entirely clean.

261
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:53,699
Sure. The toilet here is also clean.
Will I sit there to eat?

262
00:24:54,737 --> 00:24:55,872
Go, give him a lollypop.

263
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:57,126
Okay, sister.

264
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,593
Look, it's your wish.
Either you take the condom..

265
00:24:59,673 --> 00:25:00,977
..or you take your money back.

266
00:25:02,145 --> 00:25:03,323
Okay. Alright.

267
00:25:16,673 --> 00:25:18,143
Stop. Go inside.

268
00:25:18,478 --> 00:25:19,430
No, sister.

269
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,803
Go inside.
- No, sister.

270
00:25:21,214 --> 00:25:23,884
Go inside.
- Don't oppress the poor girl.

271
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:26,414
Come, girl. Nicely. Come in.

272
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:27,971
No.
- Just a minute.

273
00:25:29,614 --> 00:25:31,766
The more you squirm
the more he will enjoy.

274
00:25:32,793 --> 00:25:34,587
Give it to him easy.
Why are you giving him pleasure?

275
00:25:36,446 --> 00:25:37,517
Go.

276
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:44,328
Sit.

277
00:26:12,727 --> 00:26:15,354
Have a bath. You will feel better.

278
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:38,987
Sit here.

279
00:27:40,402 --> 00:27:42,240
She wishes to file a complaint.

280
00:27:46,575 --> 00:27:47,851
What's the complaint?

281
00:27:48,726 --> 00:27:49,948
I..

282
00:27:52,164 --> 00:27:54,900
With men.. forcibly..

283
00:27:57,029 --> 00:27:58,240
..bad deeds.

284
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:04,543
Wait.

285
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,932
Drink this.

286
00:28:08,294 --> 00:28:09,386
Drink it. Easy.

287
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:19,299
Tell me what happened from the start.

288
00:28:20,413 --> 00:28:22,878
I was abducted from my village.

289
00:28:24,651 --> 00:28:25,775
Chinna.

290
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,122
He is called Chinna.

291
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,030
He has a brother. Reddy Garu.

292
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,468
He is very rich.

293
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:38,338
I was sent to his house.

294
00:28:38,955 --> 00:28:40,144
After that..

295
00:28:41,322 --> 00:28:42,760
You are very fortunate.

296
00:28:43,517 --> 00:28:46,166
No slut ???? has sat in
my brother's car so many times.

297
00:28:48,046 --> 00:28:49,819
Good thing you ran away.

298
00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:52,641
Now you know how powerful we are.

299
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:57,916
I will go. I will surely flee.

300
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:03,332
Keep talking. Keep talking.
It makes me hot.

301
00:29:13,548 --> 00:29:14,564
Jyoti!

302
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,142
Yes.
- Jyoti!

303
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:18,240
Enough of her bullheadedness.

304
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:20,240
Send her all the customers that you can.

305
00:29:21,818 --> 00:29:23,742
If there's five you send five.
If there's seven you send her seven.

306
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,137
Damn her!

307
00:29:28,294 --> 00:29:29,429
Listen!

308
00:29:30,326 --> 00:29:31,494
Who is alive?

309
00:29:31,732 --> 00:29:32,932
Aruna!

310
00:29:35,322 --> 00:29:36,403
Come along.

311
00:29:39,852 --> 00:29:41,884
Don't let her leave the room.

312
00:29:47,117 --> 00:29:48,090
Hey.

313
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:57,820
Each time a girl runs away from here..

314
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,755
..Chinna beats Jyoti
and the girl like an animal.

315
00:30:07,211 --> 00:30:10,605
Bastard!
???? He doesn't touch the face..

316
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,638
..else we would get off.

317
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,341
Look, I understand your agony..

318
00:30:20,357 --> 00:30:22,725
..but even you need to
understand Jyoti and my agony.

319
00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:28,368
Promise you won't run.

320
00:30:28,941 --> 00:30:30,519
You won't run, will you?

321
00:30:32,184 --> 00:30:33,341
No?

322
00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:45,363
Hey.

323
00:30:46,963 --> 00:30:48,012
You won't receive any help from there..

324
00:30:48,092 --> 00:30:49,785
..you will get it from here. Swallow it.

325
00:30:56,391 --> 00:30:57,991
Alcohol is a very bad thing.

326
00:30:58,071 --> 00:30:59,796
My father was always drunk.

327
00:31:00,489 --> 00:31:03,246
He was sensible.
There isn't much time. Drink it quickly.

328
00:31:11,267 --> 00:31:12,597
Good girl.

329
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:17,224
What are you waiting for?
Swallow it quickly.

330
00:31:25,354 --> 00:31:26,749
Full glass.

331
00:31:37,603 --> 00:31:39,052
Nandu.

332
00:31:41,571 --> 00:31:42,641
Hero!

333
00:31:45,852 --> 00:31:48,133
You should invite
the customers like this.

334
00:31:48,328 --> 00:31:50,534
Look. Look out.

335
00:31:50,804 --> 00:31:51,917
Girl.

336
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:53,139
Come in.

337
00:31:53,323 --> 00:31:55,982
And listen, wear this sari down.
Put it down.

338
00:31:56,062 --> 00:31:57,463
No.
- Let me teach you.

339
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,469
Look.

340
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:01,626
When you stand here,
you should stand like this.

341
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,399
If possible you bend a little.

342
00:32:03,479 --> 00:32:05,994
Show me. Bend a little.

343
00:32:07,324 --> 00:32:09,172
Good girl. You will learn in time.

344
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,535
And listen.

345
00:32:10,615 --> 00:32:11,864
What are you listening to?

346
00:32:12,772 --> 00:32:15,107
And when you talk to customers..

347
00:32:15,864 --> 00:32:17,691
..you keep your head
down and your eyes up.

348
00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:21,335
Head down. Eyes up.

349
00:32:25,226 --> 00:32:26,242
Let's go.

350
00:32:27,096 --> 00:32:29,128
My customer is here. Later.

351
00:32:29,442 --> 00:32:30,458
Let's go.

352
00:32:30,935 --> 00:32:34,351
You've come after a long time.
Didn't you miss me?

353
00:32:37,366 --> 00:32:38,447
She is fourteen years old.

354
00:32:38,527 --> 00:32:40,166
She has only had one customer so far.

355
00:32:40,642 --> 00:32:42,134
I won't come down even one paisa.

356
00:32:56,913 --> 00:32:58,361
You proceed. I'll bring her.

357
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,989
Sir. How about a bonus
for your wedding anniversary!

358
00:33:09,843 --> 00:33:10,870
Thank you.

359
00:33:16,307 --> 00:33:17,345
Come.

360
00:33:39,821 --> 00:33:41,248
Don't forget to put it on.

361
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,578
Let's go, junior. There are two more.

362
00:34:46,631 --> 00:34:47,658
No.

363
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,047
Did you think I asked you?

364
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,961
Stand up.

365
00:34:52,177 --> 00:34:53,355
Now.

366
00:34:55,615 --> 00:34:57,021
Shall I call Chinna?

367
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:02,394
Wash up. Get ready.

368
00:35:04,588 --> 00:35:07,172
""Let me bring..""

369
00:35:08,145 --> 00:35:10,729
""Let me bring..""

370
00:35:11,334 --> 00:35:13,366
""Let me bring..""

371
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:18,112
""Let me bring..""

372
00:35:18,192 --> 00:35:24,178
""Let me bring you some toe rings,
mirror.""

373
00:35:24,778 --> 00:35:28,540
""I would do your make-up.""

374
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,870
""I would do your make-up.""

375
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:37,675
""With your friends
singing marital songs.""

376
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:44,313
""I would bless you.""

377
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:50,248
""I would bless you.""

378
00:35:50,328 --> 00:35:51,382
Maria! Maria!

379
00:35:52,831 --> 00:35:54,139
Maria!
- Maria!

380
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:55,620
Jyoti, see.

381
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:12,366
""Listen, Sugna.""

382
00:36:13,901 --> 00:36:18,939
""Wearing silver anklets on your ankles.""

383
00:36:20,647 --> 00:36:25,901
Your room. - ""Take your mother's
blessings with you.""

384
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:39,533
""Smile with the henna on your hands.""

385
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:45,609
""Wearing your beau's
ring on your finger.""

386
00:36:45,689 --> 00:36:52,917
""And hum a song.""

387
00:37:18,939 --> 00:37:20,031
Please stay today, mother.

388
00:37:20,111 --> 00:37:22,950
I paid the security guard.
He will let you stay at the hostel.

389
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:25,588
No. Who will pay your fees?

390
00:37:25,668 --> 00:37:28,139
Your boss is a nasty man!

391
00:37:28,517 --> 00:37:30,387
He doesn't give you
an off even on festive days.

392
00:37:30,571 --> 00:37:32,993
It is difficult to get
offs especially on festive days.

393
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:35,143
That's when we get the most customers.

394
00:37:35,651 --> 00:37:37,976
People make purchases
even during festivals, mother?

395
00:37:38,224 --> 00:37:39,251
Very much.

396
00:37:39,331 --> 00:37:41,846
When I come to the shop..
- Become an Engineer first.

397
00:37:42,376 --> 00:37:43,403
Yes, mother.

398
00:37:43,483 --> 00:37:45,219
Then I shall fight with your boss.

399
00:37:45,299 --> 00:37:47,273
You will never have that pleasure.

400
00:37:47,781 --> 00:37:50,127
When your studies are over,
I shall resign.

401
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:52,657
My hands are very dirty.

402
00:37:53,252 --> 00:37:55,781
Who told you to sell toilet products?

403
00:38:10,419 --> 00:38:11,976
Give me some more food.

404
00:38:17,988 --> 00:38:19,642
How are you, sister Uma?

405
00:38:19,722 --> 00:38:21,306
How are you, Bindu?
- I'm good.

406
00:38:21,386 --> 00:38:23,220
How is everyone?

407
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:25,447
Take this.
- Sister Uma.

408
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:29,339
Survarna. How are you?
- I'm very good.

409
00:38:29,419 --> 00:38:30,928
Hygiene kits for everyone.

410
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:32,897
These contain Dettol, band-aids..

411
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,578
..and most important of all. Condoms.

412
00:38:35,762 --> 00:38:37,156
I hope you are using them.

413
00:38:38,973 --> 00:38:40,011
Take this.

414
00:38:40,091 --> 00:38:41,189
Distribute it.

415
00:38:41,269 --> 00:38:43,579
I have also brought
chocolates and lollypops.

416
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:45,189
Take this.

417
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:49,525
I am Uma.

418
00:38:49,936 --> 00:38:51,341
My name is Lakshmi.

419
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:57,535
You think I am a child so
you are giving me this chocolate?

420
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:01,232
No. I thought you like chocolate.
Like I do.

421
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,054
I am not a small child.

422
00:39:05,449 --> 00:39:09,990
I raised my younger sisters.
Father used to go to work.

423
00:39:10,271 --> 00:39:11,655
Really?
- Yes.

424
00:39:12,692 --> 00:39:14,487
Father loves us very much.

425
00:39:15,546 --> 00:39:17,092
He drinks alcohol sometimes.

426
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:21,470
I cook very well.

427
00:39:22,097 --> 00:39:24,497
Father says, even better than mother.

428
00:39:25,059 --> 00:39:26,238
Wow!

429
00:39:28,691 --> 00:39:30,075
May I be frank?

430
00:39:30,562 --> 00:39:32,313
I love chocolate very much.

431
00:39:33,178 --> 00:39:34,281
Take it.

432
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:38,842
Take care. We shall meet soon, okay.

433
00:39:44,323 --> 00:39:45,891
I am keeping accounts, mother.

434
00:39:45,971 --> 00:39:47,307
I will return all your money.

435
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:50,496
Liar! Once you start earning
you won't know your mother.

436
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:51,858
Auto!

437
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,512
How could you say that?

438
00:39:54,193 --> 00:39:56,031
We shall see.
- Wait and watch.

439
00:39:57,198 --> 00:39:58,442
Nampalli?

440
00:39:59,285 --> 00:40:00,366
Go.

441
00:40:04,961 --> 00:40:06,452
Take me to Chirantan College.

442
00:40:06,669 --> 00:40:07,977
Go carefully.

443
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:31,068
Fatima, two gold flakes.

444
00:40:31,148 --> 00:40:33,501
Aruna, your newspaper and grams.

445
00:40:33,581 --> 00:40:36,572
Bindu, your betel leaf,
betel nut and tobacco.

446
00:40:43,468 --> 00:40:46,485
You rascal, you drink more
than half the bottle yourself.

447
00:40:46,884 --> 00:40:49,663
I am honest. I could mix
water in it like Govind does.

448
00:40:49,743 --> 00:40:51,955
Do you want rum mixed with water?

449
00:40:52,311 --> 00:40:53,846
No need.

450
00:40:53,926 --> 00:40:57,187
Here's your bonus for
being a loyal customer.

451
00:40:57,436 --> 00:41:01,220
Wow! This is wonderful, my boy.

452
00:41:01,858 --> 00:41:03,804
My Shahrukh Khan.

453
00:41:05,177 --> 00:41:06,215
You know what?

454
00:41:06,295 --> 00:41:09,739
You can open your account
with me when you grow up.

455
00:41:10,561 --> 00:41:12,453
Free. What do you say?

456
00:41:12,647 --> 00:41:14,323
What do you say?

457
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:19,437
Tell me before you leave. Stop. Chotu!

458
00:41:29,275 --> 00:41:30,756
Hurry off.

459
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,723
It's right? It isn't?

460
00:41:40,745 --> 00:41:43,535
Lakshmi, who will repay
the earlier debt? Your father?

461
00:41:43,615 --> 00:41:44,853
Write it in my account.

462
00:41:46,195 --> 00:41:49,989
""Pick up the broken stars.""

463
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:54,930
""Make a moon out of them.""

464
00:41:58,043 --> 00:42:00,411
""Pick up the broken stars.""

465
00:42:00,638 --> 00:42:02,832
""Make a moon out of them.""
- Yes, boss.

466
00:42:02,912 --> 00:42:07,448
""Make every corner
of your sari into the sky.""

467
00:42:07,643 --> 00:42:11,772
""The sun is a palanquin.
The shade is a bride.""

468
00:42:12,269 --> 00:42:16,961
""Don't stop loving yourself.""

469
00:42:17,133 --> 00:42:21,696
""Stuff the sun in your hair and walk.""

470
00:42:21,776 --> 00:42:25,231
""You will not find any night.""

471
00:42:26,409 --> 00:42:32,409
""Listen, silly girl, pray for yourself.""

472
00:42:32,604 --> 00:42:35,761
""You have nobody.""

473
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:41,901
""The one whom who
think is your saviour..""

474
00:42:41,981 --> 00:42:45,447
""..is not yours.""

475
00:42:45,527 --> 00:42:47,468
""The body is your room..""

476
00:42:47,548 --> 00:42:50,268
""..and the mind is your house.""

477
00:42:50,348 --> 00:42:54,765
""Your breaths are your toys.""

478
00:42:55,056 --> 00:42:59,391
""Stuff the sun in your hair and walk.""

479
00:42:59,802 --> 00:43:04,278
""You will not find any night.""

480
00:43:04,538 --> 00:43:10,494
""Listen, silly girl, pray for yourself.""

481
00:43:10,574 --> 00:43:13,002
""You have nobody.""

482
00:43:16,007 --> 00:43:18,159
Who wants to go with
me to Suberu's tomorrow?

483
00:43:20,721 --> 00:43:22,061
Raise your hand.

484
00:43:22,926 --> 00:43:24,753
I'm not going anywhere with that swine.

485
00:43:25,747 --> 00:43:27,380
Would I ask you to do something wrong?

486
00:43:27,607 --> 00:43:28,688
Raise your hand.

487
00:43:31,996 --> 00:43:34,385
You sit, Bindu. The stage will break.

488
00:43:37,942 --> 00:43:39,272
Almas, you..

489
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:42,310
You know how to dance, right?

490
00:43:46,104 --> 00:43:49,369
I see. The new one wishes to go.

491
00:43:50,483 --> 00:43:52,677
You stay this time. Next time.

492
00:43:53,142 --> 00:43:54,774
The old monkey will be happy.

493
00:43:55,261 --> 00:43:56,861
Why didn't you raise your hand?

494
00:43:57,726 --> 00:43:59,715
He cannot go without me.

495
00:44:00,808 --> 00:44:02,678
Suvarna, get the girls ready.

496
00:44:02,758 --> 00:44:03,975
Yes, boss.

497
00:44:07,392 --> 00:44:08,949
Raise your scarves.

498
00:44:16,225 --> 00:44:17,728
The other side.

499
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,852
It's right there. Look over there.

500
00:44:31,198 --> 00:44:32,809
Suberu is a lovely old man.

501
00:44:32,889 --> 00:44:34,430
He feeds us delicious meals.

502
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:37,090
And he has all varieties
of alcohol, right?

503
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:40,906
He even tips us well.
Without Chinna's knowledge.

504
00:44:42,603 --> 00:44:43,717
He can't do anything.

505
00:44:43,797 --> 00:44:45,728
If you move yourself he will be pleased.

506
00:44:48,354 --> 00:44:50,008
He removes his clothes
and lies on the bed.

507
00:44:50,088 --> 00:44:52,981
Five minutes with the hand
and one minute in the mouth.

508
00:44:53,061 --> 00:44:54,619
No, not even that much.
Thirty seconds, right?

509
00:44:54,699 --> 00:44:58,700
""My heart is in the blouse.
My heart is in the veil.""

510
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:05,770
""I will give my heart to my beloved.""

511
00:45:12,215 --> 00:45:14,961
""You have many fans.""

512
00:45:18,441 --> 00:45:20,539
Get down, princesses.

513
00:45:23,101 --> 00:45:24,258
Get the bags out.

514
00:45:24,338 --> 00:45:25,350
Got it.

515
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:34,734
They're afraid of you.

516
00:45:42,474 --> 00:45:44,376
Where are you going, you bitches. ????

517
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:47,295
Hello. Come here.

518
00:45:47,782 --> 00:45:49,512
Enough of the games. Let's go.

519
00:45:49,592 --> 00:45:50,668
Come.

520
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,906
Take the bags and get ready. Move it.

521
00:45:53,891 --> 00:45:55,426
Why are you in such a bad mood?

522
00:45:55,707 --> 00:45:57,134
Give us a smile.

523
00:45:57,674 --> 00:45:59,588
Make the old man happy
and then I'll smile at you.

524
00:45:59,668 --> 00:46:01,231
I shall do cartwheels.

525
00:46:11,988 --> 00:46:16,344
""What is behind the blouse?""

526
00:46:17,014 --> 00:46:21,295
""What is behind the blouse?""

527
00:46:21,954 --> 00:46:24,341
""What is below the veil?""

528
00:46:24,421 --> 00:46:26,276
""Below the veil?""

529
00:46:26,903 --> 00:46:29,411
""My heart is in the blouse.""

530
00:46:29,491 --> 00:46:31,778
""My heart is in the veil.""

531
00:46:31,858 --> 00:46:34,254
""My heart is in the blouse.""

532
00:46:34,427 --> 00:46:36,730
""My heart is in the veil.""

533
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:43,897
""I will give my heart to my beloved.""

534
00:46:47,173 --> 00:46:48,967
Rao Garu, if you enjoyed yourself..

535
00:46:49,047 --> 00:46:50,762
..won't you give me a bonus today?

536
00:46:56,697 --> 00:46:57,746
Thank you.

537
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:08,763
Yes, tell me.

538
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:14,492
Rao Garu, may I?

539
00:47:16,255 --> 00:47:17,541
Go.

540
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:20,644
Rao Garu.

541
00:47:22,547 --> 00:47:23,985
Let me give you a drink.

542
00:47:24,201 --> 00:47:25,325
Mine too.

543
00:47:26,785 --> 00:47:28,882
Yes, deliver it to
the brothel in Guntur.

544
00:47:28,962 --> 00:47:30,428
Yes, okay. Okay.

545
00:47:35,422 --> 00:47:37,465
Where is Lakshmi?
- She's gone to the toilet.

546
00:47:38,281 --> 00:47:39,870
When?
- A short time ago.

547
00:48:03,626 --> 00:48:04,977
Will you flee?

548
00:48:05,787 --> 00:48:06,933
I will beat you if you move.

549
00:48:07,013 --> 00:48:09,431
Don't move!
- No.

550
00:48:11,496 --> 00:48:12,717
Don't move, bitch! ????

551
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,609
No! No! No! No!

552
00:48:26,749 --> 00:48:29,711
Damn you! You dare to flee!

553
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:34,791
Survarna! Clean the blood
and get her into the car.

554
00:48:37,386 --> 00:48:38,521
Why did you run again?

555
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,591
That's it, that's it.

556
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:52,878
One day. Give me one day.

557
00:48:53,062 --> 00:48:55,483
I'll get her to work tomorrow. I swear.

558
00:48:56,488 --> 00:48:57,710
Enough of her drama.

559
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:59,526
When she has to sleep
with six men in one night..

560
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:00,802
..then she will come to her senses.

561
00:49:00,882 --> 00:49:02,532
At least let the doctor examine her.

562
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:04,359
Who cares if she
languishes here or dies?

563
00:49:04,439 --> 00:49:07,159
Just bandage the wound or
the customer will get nauseous.

564
00:49:07,331 --> 00:49:09,764
The poor girl can't even
sit up straight, Chinna.

565
00:49:10,153 --> 00:49:11,872
She doesn't have to sit.

566
00:49:12,045 --> 00:49:13,548
All she has to do is lie down..

567
00:49:13,628 --> 00:49:14,726
..and spread her legs
every fifteen minutes.

568
00:49:14,806 --> 00:49:16,985
If you open your mouth once
again I will break your arse.

569
00:49:18,153 --> 00:49:19,450
Get her ready.

570
00:49:30,478 --> 00:49:31,711
Rao Garu.

571
00:49:31,916 --> 00:49:33,451
What's the matter? Where is the girl?

572
00:49:34,175 --> 00:49:37,213
Chinna promised me he would
give me a young girl this time. - Yes.

573
00:49:37,699 --> 00:49:40,294
I paid one week ago
and I have been waiting.

574
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:41,242
Where is the girl?

575
00:49:41,322 --> 00:49:44,113
The child is unwell.

576
00:49:45,275 --> 00:49:46,389
But you will surely have her.

577
00:49:46,469 --> 00:49:47,911
Please be a little patient.

578
00:49:48,146 --> 00:49:51,093
I can wait, not him.

579
00:49:52,504 --> 00:49:53,694
I shall reason with him.

580
00:49:53,999 --> 00:49:55,251
Have you lost your mind?

581
00:49:55,653 --> 00:49:57,451
Your cave is in ruins.

582
00:49:58,178 --> 00:50:01,229
Rao Garu, one doesn't
need youth to lick, does one?

583
00:50:02,177 --> 00:50:05,014
Let's go. You must give
me a discount this time.

584
00:50:05,443 --> 00:50:07,290
Take it as a gift for
the festival of lights.

585
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:16,450
""Listen, you silly.""

586
00:50:23,203 --> 00:50:25,555
""Listen, you silly.""

587
00:50:35,028 --> 00:50:38,743
""Listen, you silly.""

588
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:44,251
""Listen, you silly.""

589
00:50:58,393 --> 00:51:00,558
No. Younger than her.

590
00:51:01,395 --> 00:51:02,606
There is none younger than her.

591
00:51:02,686 --> 00:51:03,478
Go, girl.

592
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:05,783
Okay, I'll go elsewhere.

593
00:51:07,029 --> 00:51:07,887
Return my money.

594
00:51:07,967 --> 00:51:10,067
Hold it, boss!
Hold it! Hold it!

595
00:51:13,087 --> 00:51:14,964
I have one that you want..

596
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:17,411
..but she is unwell today.

597
00:51:18,431 --> 00:51:21,848
I just want a hole.
That is okay, isn't it?

598
00:51:23,033 --> 00:51:24,313
The girl is very young.

599
00:51:24,512 --> 00:51:25,627
It will cost an extra 500.

600
00:51:26,293 --> 00:51:26,951
Age?

601
00:51:27,487 --> 00:51:28,291
Fourteen.

602
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:33,393
Let her be, Chinna.

603
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,012
Follow me.

604
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,934
Wake up, princess.

605
00:51:46,963 --> 00:51:48,139
You have to work.

606
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:39,454
""Happy birthday to you!""

607
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:43,822
""Happy birthday to you!""

608
00:52:43,902 --> 00:52:46,191
Brother.
- ""Happy birthday to you!""

609
00:52:46,381 --> 00:52:47,999
""Happy birthday to you!""

610
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,012
""Happy birthday!""

611
00:52:52,092 --> 00:52:54,364
""Happy birthday to you!""

612
00:53:00,005 --> 00:53:01,161
Suvarna.

613
00:53:03,984 --> 00:53:05,822
You look like Hema Malini today.

614
00:53:06,092 --> 00:53:07,195
Thank you.

615
00:53:08,816 --> 00:53:10,059
Aruna.

616
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,654
When will you reduce your weight?

617
00:53:16,968 --> 00:53:18,503
I don't see Lakshmi.

618
00:53:18,698 --> 00:53:20,049
She is asleep, brother.

619
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:21,800
Bring her.

620
00:53:22,914 --> 00:53:24,525
She is asleep, brother.

621
00:53:25,638 --> 00:53:28,222
She is a little under the weather.

622
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,406
Which room is she in?

623
00:53:41,033 --> 00:53:42,590
Brother. Brother.

624
00:54:11,487 --> 00:54:13,833
Motherfucker!
???? What have you been doing?

625
00:54:13,913 --> 00:54:15,887
What have you been doing?
What have you been doing?

626
00:54:16,676 --> 00:54:19,606
I made a mistake.
- You want to lose the investment.

627
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:22,071
Where is the cane?
Sona! Where is the cane?

628
00:54:22,244 --> 00:54:24,395
I will shove your
cane into your arse! ????

629
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,773
I made a mistake, brother.
- Are you crazy?

630
00:54:27,216 --> 00:54:29,022
I made a mistake. - You don't know
how to conduct business?

631
00:54:29,811 --> 00:54:31,346
You don't know how to conduct business?

632
00:54:32,881 --> 00:54:34,556
You don't know how to conduct business?

633
00:54:34,636 --> 00:54:37,139
I will kill you, scoundrel!
Scoundrel! - I made a mistake.

634
00:54:37,219 --> 00:54:40,102
You have no brains!

635
00:54:40,182 --> 00:54:43,032
I made a mistake, brother.
- Talk, scoundrel! Talk.

636
00:54:43,205 --> 00:54:44,610
Who do you think you are?

637
00:54:45,767 --> 00:54:46,945
Scoundrel!

638
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:51,659
Scoundrel!

639
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:57,280
You have no sense! Rascal!

640
00:55:20,415 --> 00:55:21,561
Chinna.

641
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:25,292
Come here.

642
00:55:45,994 --> 00:55:47,205
Does it hurt?

643
00:55:48,729 --> 00:55:49,875
A bit.

644
00:55:51,789 --> 00:55:52,880
Drink some water.

645
00:56:06,428 --> 00:56:08,546
Ram Reddy, we're arresting you both..

646
00:56:08,626 --> 00:56:10,514
..under the Immoral Trafficking Act.

647
00:56:13,951 --> 00:56:15,995
I've been through this before,
Inspector.

648
00:56:18,276 --> 00:56:20,276
You'll search, you won't find anything..

649
00:56:20,525 --> 00:56:22,028
..you'll get frustrated.

650
00:56:22,108 --> 00:56:24,244
Sir, I planted the camera in that room.

651
00:56:27,261 --> 00:56:28,396
Brother...

652
00:56:30,655 --> 00:56:32,623
He came here yesterday as a customer.

653
00:56:51,206 --> 00:56:52,233
Thank you.

654
00:56:54,211 --> 00:56:55,302
I'll get her.

655
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:57,335
Dear..

656
00:57:01,854 --> 00:57:09,800
""O heart... grow some
wings and let me fly away.""

657
00:57:16,924 --> 00:57:17,745
Not anymore.

658
00:57:17,825 --> 00:57:25,571
""O heart...grow some
wings and let me fly away.""

659
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:32,804
""I miss the courtyard of my home.""

660
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:39,430
""I miss the courtyard of my home.""

661
00:57:41,798 --> 00:57:48,078
""Why do you cry, o heart?
Let's go home.""

662
00:57:49,753 --> 00:57:52,164
""Why do you cry, o heart?""

663
00:57:52,244 --> 00:57:55,267
""Let's go home.""

664
00:58:03,092 --> 00:58:04,930
I know you women
have been through hell..

665
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:08,432
..but I need someone
to testify in court.

666
00:58:09,157 --> 00:58:10,984
Without a witness these
guys will come back..

667
00:58:11,157 --> 00:58:12,995
..and destroy more innocent lives.

668
00:58:14,714 --> 00:58:17,039
I don't need an answer right now.

669
00:58:18,011 --> 00:58:19,698
I just want all of
you to think about it.

670
00:58:35,016 --> 00:58:43,027
""I've weaved my dreams
on the broad paths of my dream.""

671
00:58:43,558 --> 00:58:48,433
""And hopped and skipped on it.""

672
00:58:50,974 --> 00:58:54,855
""Wipe your tears and keep moving on.""

673
00:58:54,935 --> 00:58:59,070
""Walk towards the dawn.""

674
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:09,340
""Let's go back to the
courtyard of my home.""

675
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:20,399
""The courtyard that I still remember.""

676
00:59:41,554 --> 00:59:42,527
Sister...

677
00:59:45,944 --> 00:59:48,008
You have got up, my princess!

678
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:53,695
My, my you look radiant!

679
00:59:57,079 --> 00:59:59,079
Sister, he had come to my room.

680
00:59:59,975 --> 01:00:01,413
This is Mr. Mohan...

681
01:00:01,493 --> 01:00:03,143
He's the one who rescued us.

682
01:00:03,223 --> 01:00:04,711
He is a social worker...

683
01:00:05,002 --> 01:00:07,240
We are at a Women's shelter...

684
01:00:08,764 --> 01:00:10,504
These people are good, my child.

685
01:00:13,251 --> 01:00:15,272
Let's check the wound.

686
01:00:15,791 --> 01:00:16,753
Come...

687
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:31,737
Kiddo!

688
01:00:31,953 --> 01:00:33,791
I felt today you would be better.

689
01:00:33,871 --> 01:00:35,143
I mean properly.

690
01:00:36,763 --> 01:00:38,417
You went totally crazy..

691
01:00:38,497 --> 01:00:40,169
..getting drenched in the rain.

692
01:00:42,287 --> 01:00:43,801
Where are the others?

693
01:00:44,006 --> 01:00:45,412
Dharam Vilas is open again.

694
01:00:46,223 --> 01:00:47,769
They went back to work.

695
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:53,293
They don't allow it.

696
01:00:53,628 --> 01:00:55,077
But I sneaked it in.

697
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:13,163
I was waiting for you
to get better so I could leave.

698
01:01:16,234 --> 01:01:19,196
No sister...don't leave me and go.

699
01:01:19,834 --> 01:01:21,434
You have Mr. Mohan here.

700
01:01:21,514 --> 01:01:22,904
He'll take good care of you.

701
01:01:23,455 --> 01:01:25,207
He's a man.

702
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:29,251
You're a brave girl,
but the others aren't.

703
01:01:34,668 --> 01:01:35,706
I'll leave.

704
01:01:42,689 --> 01:01:44,094
Sister, you're back!

705
01:01:44,174 --> 01:01:45,835
How are you?
- Fine.

706
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:51,121
Once a whore, ???? always a whore ????
that's what I keep telling..

707
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:53,694
..the cops who want to rescue you all...

708
01:01:54,288 --> 01:01:56,201
The poor, unfortunate whores. ????

709
01:01:56,418 --> 01:01:58,558
You need me to run this place.

710
01:01:59,218 --> 01:02:01,574
And I need money for
my daughter's education.

711
01:02:02,494 --> 01:02:05,434
Just bring her here
and save us this pretense.

712
01:02:05,791 --> 01:02:07,759
What will you do with her Chinna?

713
01:02:08,289 --> 01:02:11,489
Just like all of us
you like dick ???? too.

714
01:02:14,461 --> 01:02:16,753
Bloody bitch! ???? -No...No...No!

715
01:02:17,726 --> 01:02:20,406
Should I just knock all your teeth out?

716
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:23,228
Do what you must with me
but my daughter is off limits.

717
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:28,342
The 'dick' ????
comment is going to cost you some day.

718
01:02:29,335 --> 01:02:30,633
I know.

719
01:02:33,693 --> 01:02:36,395
Get the machines oiled..
the factory is closed.

720
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:51,292
What are you doing?

721
01:02:51,767 --> 01:02:53,259
Chinna is right...

722
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:55,930
I'm not good at anything...else.

723
01:02:58,935 --> 01:03:00,330
I can bring any man to his knees..

724
01:03:00,795 --> 01:03:02,827
..just so he could touch my body.

725
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,594
I can make him cheat on his wife..

726
01:03:05,674 --> 01:03:07,561
..just to spend a little time with me.

727
01:03:08,523 --> 01:03:09,572
I can make him sell his mother..

728
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:11,193
..so he could spend a night with me.

729
01:03:11,906 --> 01:03:15,269
This is what I know to do
and this is what I should be doing.

730
01:03:16,912 --> 01:03:18,663
We can make a new life for ourselves.

731
01:03:19,744 --> 01:03:21,041
Doing what?

732
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:24,090
Weaving baskets like beggars?

733
01:03:24,998 --> 01:03:26,912
We're worse than lepers.

734
01:03:27,582 --> 01:03:30,836
Our families won't accept us,
our friends refuse to recognize us.

735
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:33,679
And society hopes
we get buried somewhere.

736
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:37,258
Whatever happens.. you can't go back!

737
01:03:38,533 --> 01:03:39,409
Look...

738
01:03:40,446 --> 01:03:43,592
I have five, maybe ten years.

739
01:03:44,144 --> 01:03:46,533
After that even the scumbag
customers won't want this body.

740
01:03:47,841 --> 01:03:49,776
Then maybe I'll weave baskets.

741
01:04:22,133 --> 01:04:23,733
You're the last one.

742
01:04:24,165 --> 01:04:25,689
Would you like to leave too?

743
01:04:26,814 --> 01:04:28,479
I want to go to court.

744
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:30,922
No.

745
01:04:31,982 --> 01:04:34,144
They are really bad people.
- I agree.

746
01:04:34,224 --> 01:04:35,906
Bad people should be punished.

747
01:04:36,468 --> 01:04:39,873
You're right,
but a court is no place for a child.

748
01:04:41,527 --> 01:04:44,089
I have lived in Dharam
Vilas for six months.

749
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:10,036
Mohan, Avinash is an amazing lawyer..

750
01:05:10,242 --> 01:05:12,317
...but he hasn't practiced
since many years.

751
01:05:12,631 --> 01:05:15,074
He suffered a nervous breakdown.
- What?

752
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:16,296
Don't worry.

753
01:05:16,376 --> 01:05:18,447
The best thing about this
guy is he cannot be bought.

754
01:05:51,734 --> 01:05:52,988
Nothing here too.

755
01:05:54,394 --> 01:05:56,026
No precedence here.

756
01:05:56,469 --> 01:05:58,232
So no point of SITA.

757
01:05:58,923 --> 01:06:00,632
Sorry PITA.

758
01:06:03,464 --> 01:06:05,161
Who is Sita... and Pita?

759
01:06:05,241 --> 01:06:07,248
Suppression of Immoral Trafficking Act.

760
01:06:07,328 --> 01:06:08,340
SITA!

761
01:06:08,534 --> 01:06:10,318
Which was later changed to PITA.

762
01:06:10,398 --> 01:06:12,059
Prevention of Immoral Trafficking Act.

763
01:06:13,064 --> 01:06:15,821
It was a law designed
to protect girls like you.

764
01:06:18,501 --> 01:06:21,669
And how many times have
the Reddy brothers been saved?

765
01:06:21,885 --> 01:06:23,009
Four times.

766
01:06:26,177 --> 01:06:30,090
And you want me to try
and convict the Reddy brothers..

767
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:35,247
...with this little girl?

768
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:38,729
Have you gone mad?

769
01:06:41,216 --> 01:06:42,599
What do you want from me?

770
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:47,108
I stopped practicing
because of such cases.

771
01:06:48,027 --> 01:06:50,145
You want me to have
another nervous breakdown?

772
01:06:50,225 --> 01:06:52,178
Sir, we think..
- What do you think?

773
01:06:53,497 --> 01:06:54,697
What do you think?

774
01:06:55,919 --> 01:07:00,038
You think that she'll hold
up in court for even two minutes?

775
01:07:02,513 --> 01:07:04,416
You have that much faith in her?

776
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:18,978
Our best chance is to go for rape..

777
01:07:22,059 --> 01:07:23,875
..but there is no point..

778
01:07:25,907 --> 01:07:27,140
..it was done months ago and there is..

779
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:29,215
..no police report...no
medical evidence.

780
01:07:31,713 --> 01:07:34,870
So that leaves us with PITA,
under which there has..

781
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:37,529
..been no conviction in this state.

782
01:07:38,427 --> 01:07:39,735
So what do we have?

783
01:07:39,815 --> 01:07:41,248
A small child.

784
01:07:45,745 --> 01:07:47,593
Who won't hold up in
court for even two minutes.

785
01:07:47,673 --> 01:07:49,777
We'll do all the work and make efforts..

786
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:51,658
..and at the last
minute she'll back down.

787
01:07:52,589 --> 01:07:53,810
I won't.

788
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:18,481
They'll scare you,
threaten you, defame you..

789
01:08:19,843 --> 01:08:22,298
They will..
- Rip my strength and dignity to shreds.

790
01:08:34,821 --> 01:08:35,718
Okay...

791
01:08:39,793 --> 01:08:40,961
I'll take this case.

792
01:09:03,574 --> 01:09:05,273
Little girl,
will you be able to do all this?

793
01:09:05,353 --> 01:09:06,743
Don't talk to her! - Don't push.

794
01:09:06,823 --> 01:09:10,518
Don't talk to her. Don't talk to her.
- Think about it.

795
01:09:10,598 --> 01:09:13,393
Whatever the consequences
will not be my responsibility.

796
01:09:14,204 --> 01:09:15,480
Last chance!

797
01:09:37,815 --> 01:09:40,636
Let me tell you, I'm terrified.

798
01:09:41,663 --> 01:09:42,820
Me too.

799
01:09:43,631 --> 01:09:45,750
Case No. 432

800
01:09:46,226 --> 01:09:47,545
Oh crap!

801
01:09:49,058 --> 01:09:51,232
Okay.. Are you ready?

802
01:09:52,237 --> 01:09:53,102
Are you ready?

803
01:10:07,935 --> 01:10:08,897
Give it to me.

804
01:10:10,475 --> 01:10:12,983
I'll take it. - Fine.

805
01:10:21,015 --> 01:10:22,529
What's your full name?

806
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:24,356
Bangaru Lakshmi.

807
01:10:25,091 --> 01:10:26,313
How old are you?

808
01:10:26,799 --> 01:10:27,999
14 years.

809
01:10:29,783 --> 01:10:31,697
Do you know those two men?

810
01:10:34,173 --> 01:10:36,919
Yes. They run Dharam Vilas.

811
01:10:38,508 --> 01:10:39,730
What is Dharam Vilas?

812
01:10:40,259 --> 01:10:41,189
It's a brothel house.

813
01:10:41,269 --> 01:10:42,497
I object, your honor.

814
01:10:42,789 --> 01:10:44,108
Objection overruled.

815
01:10:45,351 --> 01:10:47,297
Is this the one you're referring to?

816
01:10:47,935 --> 01:10:48,973
Yes.

817
01:10:50,054 --> 01:10:51,351
You were brought to the girl's hostel..

818
01:10:51,431 --> 01:10:52,659
..which you are calling
a brothel house...

819
01:10:53,492 --> 01:10:54,919
What did you do in the hostel?

820
01:10:54,999 --> 01:10:55,989
It is a brothel house.

821
01:10:56,069 --> 01:10:58,205
What did you do in the hostel?

822
01:10:58,843 --> 01:11:00,897
I just explained
everything to Mr. Avinash.

823
01:11:01,124 --> 01:11:02,573
Please explain again.

824
01:11:06,259 --> 01:11:10,183
Chinna forced us..

825
01:11:10,263 --> 01:11:13,449
..forced us to do things with men...

826
01:11:15,459 --> 01:11:17,157
..dirty things.
- Things like what?

827
01:11:18,286 --> 01:11:19,194
We..

828
01:11:20,156 --> 01:11:22,513
We had to...have sex.

829
01:11:23,799 --> 01:11:24,945
Describe it.

830
01:11:25,453 --> 01:11:26,415
What?

831
01:11:27,064 --> 01:11:29,551
Sex. Please describe it in detail.

832
01:11:32,902 --> 01:11:36,934
You would know the meaning
of sex as you are a grownup.

833
01:11:37,485 --> 01:11:41,648
Exactly! How would a young
girl like you know the meaning of sex?

834
01:11:43,355 --> 01:11:46,057
What happened at Reddy Garu's house?

835
01:11:46,137 --> 01:11:47,344
How long did you stay there?

836
01:11:48,252 --> 01:11:49,322
Three weeks.

837
01:11:49,402 --> 01:11:50,598
On your own free will?

838
01:11:50,782 --> 01:11:52,706
Yes.
- Did he take good care of you?

839
01:11:54,371 --> 01:11:55,290
Yes, but..

840
01:11:55,370 --> 01:11:57,366
And he nursed you back to health?

841
01:11:57,873 --> 01:12:02,490
Yes, but then one day he attacked me.

842
01:12:02,739 --> 01:12:05,496
He brings you home,
nurses you back to health..

843
01:12:05,917 --> 01:12:07,582
..and then he attacks you?

844
01:12:08,155 --> 01:12:09,669
Seems really strange.

845
01:12:13,658 --> 01:12:16,047
Anyway...how did he attack you?

846
01:12:21,603 --> 01:12:24,770
He...he...

847
01:12:26,521 --> 01:12:28,586
..threw me on the bed...

848
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:34,846
...he... he raped me.

849
01:12:39,926 --> 01:12:41,710
Silence!
- Rape?

850
01:12:42,526 --> 01:12:44,580
That's another big
word for a little girl.

851
01:12:44,796 --> 01:12:46,007
Describe it.

852
01:12:46,191 --> 01:12:46,893
Objection!

853
01:12:46,973 --> 01:12:49,553
Firstly, there is no medical
report for rape charge.

854
01:12:49,855 --> 01:12:52,882
Secondly,
when I ask her to describe sex..

855
01:12:53,379 --> 01:12:54,752
..Mr. Avinash objects.

856
01:12:55,249 --> 01:12:57,714
When I ask her to describe rape,
my colleague objects.

857
01:12:58,947 --> 01:13:00,655
Both these accusations
were made by his client..

858
01:13:00,735 --> 01:13:02,623
..on my client and
they are very serious.

859
01:13:03,185 --> 01:13:04,526
And I want to make sure..

860
01:13:05,045 --> 01:13:06,677
..she knows the meaning
of these accusations.

861
01:13:07,056 --> 01:13:08,050
Proceed.

862
01:13:10,915 --> 01:13:12,407
You were describing rape.

863
01:13:16,288 --> 01:13:18,115
I don't know how to describe it.

864
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:22,743
But, it happened to me...

865
01:13:24,213 --> 01:13:25,489
..many times.

866
01:13:27,997 --> 01:13:32,246
Only the person to
whom it happens, knows.

867
01:13:35,824 --> 01:13:37,857
Your honor,
Dharam Vilas is such a hostel run by..

868
01:13:38,235 --> 01:13:41,360
..my clients for runaway
girls like Lakshmi.

869
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:43,479
It's a charitable organization.

870
01:13:43,987 --> 01:13:46,333
What the girls do
in the hostel on their..

871
01:13:46,413 --> 01:13:48,851
..own time are beyond
my client's control.

872
01:13:49,597 --> 01:13:51,468
See the greatness of Reddy Garu..

873
01:13:51,695 --> 01:13:53,500
..he gave Lakshmi shelter in his house.

874
01:13:53,792 --> 01:13:55,003
He took care of her..

875
01:13:55,083 --> 01:13:56,441
..and how does she repay him.

876
01:13:56,971 --> 01:13:58,527
The horrifying accusation of rape.

877
01:14:11,026 --> 01:14:12,085
Lakshmi.

878
01:14:22,247 --> 01:14:25,641
I'm sorry I didn't protect you in court.

879
01:14:26,246 --> 01:14:27,295
Go.

880
01:14:33,225 --> 01:14:35,646
Dharam Vilas is a ladies hostel.

881
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,673
We do social service.

882
01:14:39,463 --> 01:14:42,198
We give shelter to destitute girls.

883
01:14:43,009 --> 01:14:45,474
Last year we had given shelter to....

884
01:14:46,739 --> 01:14:47,658
24 girls...

885
01:14:47,738 --> 01:14:53,474
24 girls were given shelter,
food and clothes...

886
01:15:25,106 --> 01:15:27,355
Reddy, get out of here!

887
01:15:30,089 --> 01:15:31,787
It's a public space.

888
01:15:32,944 --> 01:15:34,987
You don't scare me.

889
01:15:35,625 --> 01:15:37,949
It's not you who I'm trying to scare.

890
01:15:38,122 --> 01:15:40,024
It's my investment you have in there.

891
01:15:40,104 --> 01:15:41,592
Till when will you hide here?

892
01:15:41,884 --> 01:15:44,165
Tell Lakshmi, that even accidentally..

893
01:15:44,727 --> 01:15:46,759
..she shouldn't open her mouth.

894
01:15:47,505 --> 01:15:50,381
If she must, open it for taking it in.

895
01:15:50,461 --> 01:15:51,959
Not to speak in court.

896
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,765
This time you are trapped.

897
01:16:07,569 --> 01:16:09,806
This sting operation was carried out..

898
01:16:09,886 --> 01:16:11,709
..by our organization and the police.

899
01:16:12,336 --> 01:16:15,017
And how did you record this footage?

900
01:16:15,461 --> 01:16:18,282
I stuck a pen camera in my shirt and..

901
01:16:18,362 --> 01:16:20,488
..went to Dharam Vilas as a customer.

902
01:16:20,693 --> 01:16:23,645
You can see in this video that Chinna..

903
01:16:24,109 --> 01:16:25,774
..is taking money from me for Lakshmi.

904
01:16:26,293 --> 01:16:28,369
Is this the same pen camera?

905
01:16:28,628 --> 01:16:29,828
Yes.

906
01:16:31,288 --> 01:16:32,996
Your honor, let me explain.

907
01:16:33,515 --> 01:16:36,499
My clients place their
hostel girls in different jobs.

908
01:16:37,094 --> 01:16:38,554
And then take an advance
from their salary..

909
01:16:39,343 --> 01:16:41,094
..and that's what they were discussing.

910
01:16:41,612 --> 01:16:42,661
And we know how easy it is..

911
01:16:42,741 --> 01:16:44,391
..these days to make such a video.

912
01:16:47,288 --> 01:16:48,650
Special effects.

913
01:16:50,088 --> 01:16:51,709
This time we have all the proof.

914
01:16:51,947 --> 01:16:53,223
Videos, marked notes.

915
01:16:53,303 --> 01:16:54,672
How can they escape this time?

916
01:16:54,845 --> 01:16:57,320
What do you think?
Others haven't tried before?

917
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:01,483
What's the point of Lakshmi's courage?

918
01:17:01,563 --> 01:17:02,910
It helped.

919
01:17:03,213 --> 01:17:04,585
You rescued Lakshmi.

920
01:17:04,665 --> 01:17:06,348
But those brothers will not spare her..

921
01:17:06,428 --> 01:17:08,132
..and her family will not take her back.

922
01:17:08,212 --> 01:17:09,397
Where will she go?

923
01:17:11,645 --> 01:17:13,429
A 14 year old girl..

924
01:17:13,509 --> 01:17:14,953
..talks about sex and rape.

925
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:17,656
This is the problem of our country.

926
01:17:18,023 --> 01:17:19,472
Children grow up too fast.

927
01:17:19,656 --> 01:17:21,764
Learn too much too quickly.

928
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:23,440
Now this entire case hinges on the..

929
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:24,975
..testimony of one 14 year old girl.

930
01:17:25,537 --> 01:17:27,202
A girl whose character
is highly doubtful.

931
01:17:27,808 --> 01:17:29,818
..who is not as innocent as she looks.

932
01:17:30,878 --> 01:17:34,478
I request your honor
to dismiss this case.

933
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:49,278
I want to show the tape.

934
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:51,116
No.

935
01:17:51,196 --> 01:17:52,554
I have run out of options.

936
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:54,640
Can you guarantee it will work?

937
01:17:55,277 --> 01:17:56,142
No.

938
01:17:56,222 --> 01:17:58,737
They can dismiss it as a fabrication.

939
01:17:59,018 --> 01:18:00,974
Didn't we already show the tape?

940
01:18:01,245 --> 01:18:04,499
Another tape was made,
for real evidence.

941
01:18:05,483 --> 01:18:08,326
Of what goes on in Dharam Vilas.

942
01:18:09,742 --> 01:18:14,337
It shows what happened
to you in your room.

943
01:18:20,109 --> 01:18:21,580
I have to appeal..

944
01:18:22,412 --> 01:18:26,174
..to the judge's sympathy and humanity.

945
01:18:27,245 --> 01:18:28,726
Nothing else is working.

946
01:18:30,693 --> 01:18:31,860
Okay.

947
01:18:44,347 --> 01:18:45,569
One.

948
01:18:55,785 --> 01:18:56,812
Two.

949
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:06,964
Three.

950
01:19:22,833 --> 01:19:24,217
Four.

951
01:19:38,423 --> 01:19:39,547
Five.

952
01:19:51,029 --> 01:19:52,132
Six.

953
01:20:08,413 --> 01:20:09,505
Seven.

954
01:20:11,127 --> 01:20:14,057
Seven times in one night.

955
01:20:15,452 --> 01:20:18,447
As you saw this was rape.

956
01:20:19,755 --> 01:20:21,723
Not sex. Rape.

957
01:20:23,463 --> 01:20:25,874
And she was running a high fever.

958
01:20:31,344 --> 01:20:34,198
This is the inhumanity
that I'm asking you to punish.

959
01:21:02,371 --> 01:21:03,473
Give me your hand.

960
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:15,452
Until today I never asked
you more than was necessary.

961
01:21:18,404 --> 01:21:20,079
But now it's time.

962
01:21:22,317 --> 01:21:24,544
The judge will have
to take us seriously.

963
01:21:27,182 --> 01:21:30,544
This is our only chance
to punish all the culprits.

964
01:21:32,522 --> 01:21:35,593
You need to tell me the
truth from the beginning.

965
01:21:40,781 --> 01:21:42,165
Lakshmi!

966
01:21:42,511 --> 01:21:44,306
What a beautiful name.

967
01:21:44,727 --> 01:21:46,165
You are so pretty.

968
01:21:46,641 --> 01:21:47,527
Come.

969
01:21:47,905 --> 01:21:49,862
Wait here, I will be right back.

970
01:22:00,014 --> 01:22:01,398
Rs. 30,000.

971
01:22:01,668 --> 01:22:02,717
Thanks.

972
01:22:06,490 --> 01:22:09,884
Wait here with Radha,
I'll be back with the bus tickets.

973
01:22:35,257 --> 01:22:36,836
Rs. 35,000.

974
01:22:36,916 --> 01:22:38,079
50.

975
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,776
You're charging almost double.

976
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:45,938
Your brother wanted a young child.

977
01:22:46,018 --> 01:22:48,348
It took me a lot of
trouble finding this one.

978
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:00,933
She is there.

979
01:23:34,792 --> 01:23:36,554
Trying to run away.

980
01:23:36,857 --> 01:23:39,906
""Listen, Sugna.""

981
01:23:41,247 --> 01:23:45,777
""Wear the veil of your mother's house.""

982
01:23:47,992 --> 01:23:53,722
""Take your mother's blessings with you.""

983
01:24:02,532 --> 01:24:04,208
My father sold me.

984
01:24:14,328 --> 01:24:15,874
Your honor,
I would like to add Bangaru Raju..

985
01:24:15,954 --> 01:24:17,712
..to the list of accused.

986
01:24:24,177 --> 01:24:26,448
Is this the lady
your father sold you to?

987
01:24:28,643 --> 01:24:29,594
Yes.

988
01:24:31,032 --> 01:24:32,632
Your honor, I would like to add..

989
01:24:32,712 --> 01:24:34,729
..Corporator Radha
to the list of accused.

990
01:24:39,714 --> 01:24:40,427
Order.

991
01:24:40,773 --> 01:24:43,076
You're the bravest girl in the world.

992
01:24:48,816 --> 01:24:50,967
Next hearing of this
case will be on 27th May.

993
01:24:51,335 --> 01:24:54,372
Mr. Faizal you will
ensure that Bangaru Raju..

994
01:24:54,685 --> 01:24:57,215
..and Corporator Radha
Rao are in the court that day.

995
01:24:58,058 --> 01:24:59,366
The court is adjourned.

996
01:25:01,398 --> 01:25:03,755
I'm truly sorry, madam.

997
01:25:04,685 --> 01:25:05,604
Forgive me.

998
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:08,090
I had told you,
that my name should never come in this.

999
01:25:08,339 --> 01:25:09,268
Then how did this happen?

1000
01:25:09,348 --> 01:25:11,604
Ma'am, our options
right now are very limited.

1001
01:25:12,274 --> 01:25:13,657
We can't bribe this judge.

1002
01:25:13,737 --> 01:25:14,835
Why is everyone getting carried..

1003
01:25:14,915 --> 01:25:16,500
..away with the truth all of a sudden?

1004
01:25:17,711 --> 01:25:22,478
Bribe the girl.
Get her to retract her statement.

1005
01:25:23,959 --> 01:25:25,656
And don't send this
ignorant brother of yours.

1006
01:25:25,826 --> 01:25:26,484
You go personally.

1007
01:26:05,798 --> 01:26:06,756
Lakshmi.

1008
01:26:09,369 --> 01:26:10,293
My child.

1009
01:26:14,018 --> 01:26:15,098
Are you upset with me?

1010
01:26:19,897 --> 01:26:22,670
I know what I did was wrong..

1011
01:26:24,149 --> 01:26:25,577
..and I feel terrible about it.

1012
01:26:28,106 --> 01:26:29,246
Please forgive me.

1013
01:26:32,501 --> 01:26:33,187
Look at me.

1014
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:36,005
I am an old man..

1015
01:26:38,768 --> 01:26:40,916
..and completely shattered..

1016
01:26:44,348 --> 01:26:46,925
I realize my mistake.

1017
01:26:48,123 --> 01:26:52,313
If you want we can send Chinna to jail.

1018
01:26:53,953 --> 01:26:55,181
He is the evil one.

1019
01:26:56,668 --> 01:26:58,753
He made you suffer.

1020
01:27:02,118 --> 01:27:03,415
But forgive me.

1021
01:27:06,044 --> 01:27:10,429
Please, forgive me..
you have a forgiving heart.

1022
01:27:14,295 --> 01:27:16,128
There must be some
place for my forgiveness.

1023
01:27:59,865 --> 01:28:00,911
Lakshmi!

1024
01:28:03,428 --> 01:28:04,310
Lakshmi!

1025
01:28:06,489 --> 01:28:07,605
Lakshmi!

1026
01:28:21,605 --> 01:28:23,145
Ms. Radha, I couldn't convince her.

1027
01:28:24,295 --> 01:28:25,566
I tried my best.

1028
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:28,455
Hello.

1029
01:28:29,674 --> 01:28:30,427
Hello..

1030
01:28:32,926 --> 01:28:34,197
What the..

1031
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,107
Sister.

1032
01:28:56,165 --> 01:28:57,125
How are you?

1033
01:28:58,111 --> 01:28:59,019
Fine.

1034
01:29:04,364 --> 01:29:05,802
The Lakshmi vs Reddy Brothers..

1035
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:08,068
..court case in the
Andhra Pradesh High Court...

1036
01:29:08,148 --> 01:29:11,985
..both the sides have
finished making arguments

1037
01:29:12,167 --> 01:29:13,888
Lakshmi, you have a visitor.

1038
01:29:13,968 --> 01:29:16,275
The courage of young
14 years old Lakshmi..

1039
01:29:16,465 --> 01:29:22,563
..against the powerful corporator
Radha and Reddy Brothers..

1040
01:29:38,374 --> 01:29:39,464
Can you ever forgive me?

1041
01:29:41,695 --> 01:29:42,534
No.

1042
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:46,799
I know. I can help you.

1043
01:29:56,294 --> 01:29:58,206
You want to call another witness?

1044
01:29:58,768 --> 01:30:01,086
Your honor,
we were not informed of this witness.

1045
01:30:01,761 --> 01:30:03,422
We didn't have any option, your honor.

1046
01:30:04,191 --> 01:30:06,067
We've kept the witness
a secret because every..

1047
01:30:06,716 --> 01:30:08,800
..witness has been
bought or intimidated.

1048
01:30:09,578 --> 01:30:10,988
Alright. Go on.

1049
01:30:11,152 --> 01:30:14,231
We call Dr. Muralidaran
as our next witness, your honor.

1050
01:30:27,385 --> 01:30:29,625
You are Mr. Ram Reddy's personal doctor?

1051
01:30:30,057 --> 01:30:30,922
Yes.

1052
01:30:31,363 --> 01:30:34,477
For the past 8 years
I am his personal physician.

1053
01:30:35,844 --> 01:30:39,813
Last year..
between June 11th and July 2nd..

1054
01:30:40,203 --> 01:30:41,716
..did you see my client Lakshmi..

1055
01:30:41,796 --> 01:30:44,907
..at Mr. Reddy's place last year.
- Yes.

1056
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:48,393
What were you called there for?

1057
01:30:49,846 --> 01:30:51,455
To give some injections to Lakshmi.

1058
01:30:51,819 --> 01:30:52,995
What kind of injections?

1059
01:30:53,833 --> 01:30:55,069
Estrogen injections.

1060
01:30:55,149 --> 01:30:57,571
What are Estrogen injections?

1061
01:30:57,802 --> 01:31:00,535
They are hormonal injections given..

1062
01:31:01,184 --> 01:31:03,346
..to girls so they can develop faster.

1063
01:31:04,782 --> 01:31:06,364
To make a girl look like a woman.

1064
01:31:06,824 --> 01:31:08,770
Please describe it in detail.

1065
01:31:11,822 --> 01:31:14,737
These injections make
girls develop faster.

1066
01:31:15,723 --> 01:31:21,413
They grow breasts faster,
and the menstruate cycle starts earlier.

1067
01:31:22,597 --> 01:31:25,815
On the Reddy brothers saying..

1068
01:31:26,636 --> 01:31:28,184
..do you give such injections often?

1069
01:31:28,264 --> 01:31:30,286
I mean, is it a common practice?

1070
01:31:30,414 --> 01:31:31,571
Objection, your honor.

1071
01:31:31,726 --> 01:31:33,747
I want to hear this. Go on.

1072
01:31:33,896 --> 01:31:36,016
The practice has become
common these days.

1073
01:31:37,290 --> 01:31:38,878
The demand for younger
girls has increased.

1074
01:31:40,174 --> 01:31:40,932
I see.

1075
01:31:43,008 --> 01:31:44,464
What happened on July 25th?

1076
01:31:45,776 --> 01:31:49,198
I was called in to treat the girl.

1077
01:31:49,413 --> 01:31:50,534
What was she being treated for?

1078
01:31:51,607 --> 01:31:54,056
She was molested.

1079
01:31:54,609 --> 01:31:57,321
Did you find any proof?

1080
01:31:57,875 --> 01:31:58,823
Yes.

1081
01:31:59,591 --> 01:32:05,429
There was vaginal tearing
and signs of forced entry.

1082
01:32:06,274 --> 01:32:07,090
I see.

1083
01:32:08,833 --> 01:32:13,925
Is it correct to say
that Lakshmi was raped?

1084
01:32:14,769 --> 01:32:15,482
Yes.

1085
01:32:20,111 --> 01:32:22,927
Order. Order.
- One more question.

1086
01:32:23,786 --> 01:32:24,630
Tell me..

1087
01:32:25,612 --> 01:32:29,030
..what are you treating Mr.
Ram Reddy for?

1088
01:32:29,189 --> 01:32:30,165
I object, your honor.

1089
01:32:30,635 --> 01:32:32,220
How is this relevant to the case?

1090
01:32:32,621 --> 01:32:34,461
If you'll let me continue..

1091
01:32:34,541 --> 01:32:36,343
..I'll prove the relevance, your honor.

1092
01:32:36,952 --> 01:32:37,990
Proceed.

1093
01:32:39,222 --> 01:32:40,301
Dr. Murali..

1094
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:43,730
..what are you treating Mr.
Ram Reddy for?

1095
01:32:53,385 --> 01:32:54,174
AIDS.

1096
01:33:07,797 --> 01:33:08,801
Order!

1097
01:33:10,350 --> 01:33:11,333
Order!

1098
01:33:12,571 --> 01:33:18,224
Now...please tell us how is
this connected to my client Lakshmi?

1099
01:33:18,806 --> 01:33:20,577
There is a belief that..

1100
01:33:21,137 --> 01:33:25,822
..AIDS can be cured
if the infected person..

1101
01:33:27,241 --> 01:33:28,381
..has sexual intercourse with a virgin.

1102
01:33:29,059 --> 01:33:33,108
An adolescent child, right?

1103
01:33:34,830 --> 01:33:35,654
Yes.

1104
01:33:38,372 --> 01:33:39,497
No further questions.

1105
01:33:40,289 --> 01:33:41,223
Your witness.

1106
01:33:46,419 --> 01:33:48,903
I will announce my verdict on 6th June.

1107
01:34:07,846 --> 01:34:08,779
Sister!

1108
01:34:10,385 --> 01:34:11,968
Is this Chinna's religious day?

1109
01:34:12,612 --> 01:34:14,079
How else do you think I got out?

1110
01:34:15,027 --> 01:34:17,034
All the girls miss you.

1111
01:34:17,324 --> 01:34:20,590
I miss them too... especially you.

1112
01:34:20,971 --> 01:34:22,472
We see you on the news.

1113
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:24,678
You're quite a star.

1114
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:25,820
Really?

1115
01:34:27,314 --> 01:34:29,860
I brought some makeup
for the next time you're on TV.

1116
01:34:30,974 --> 01:34:32,717
But I cry a lot in court.

1117
01:34:33,084 --> 01:34:34,779
The makeup will get ruined.

1118
01:34:36,004 --> 01:34:38,439
Then make sure that you do all your..

1119
01:34:38,674 --> 01:34:40,321
..interviews before
entering the courtroom.

1120
01:34:41,546 --> 01:34:42,664
Okay.

1121
01:34:44,051 --> 01:34:45,850
I know how to use this

1122
01:35:05,176 --> 01:35:06,165
Chinna, don't!

1123
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:08,849
Please don't!

1124
01:35:10,890 --> 01:35:12,391
All whores ???? get out!

1125
01:35:20,783 --> 01:35:23,496
Nothing goes on here
without your knowledge.

1126
01:35:25,247 --> 01:35:28,222
How did the camera
get into Lakshmi's room?

1127
01:35:36,104 --> 01:35:36,851
No!

1128
01:35:38,795 --> 01:35:40,269
No, Chinna.

1129
01:35:42,081 --> 01:35:44,046
I know how to make you talk.

1130
01:35:56,299 --> 01:35:57,274
Mother...

1131
01:35:58,561 --> 01:35:59,557
Are you okay?

1132
01:36:00,644 --> 01:36:02,858
I just love family reunions.

1133
01:36:05,722 --> 01:36:09,098
Mother.
- Go. Leave this place at once.

1134
01:36:09,178 --> 01:36:09,776
You go.

1135
01:36:09,856 --> 01:36:12,060
Is it true, what this man told me?

1136
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:13,478
Yes, it's the truth!

1137
01:36:13,558 --> 01:36:15,104
She is the head madam here.

1138
01:36:15,395 --> 01:36:16,613
Imagine, your mother.

1139
01:36:20,112 --> 01:36:21,191
Forgive me.

1140
01:36:24,748 --> 01:36:25,917
Forgive me.

1141
01:36:26,803 --> 01:36:29,854
Mother, is this what you do?

1142
01:36:37,533 --> 01:36:42,342
No, dear. Don't hate your mother now.

1143
01:36:43,214 --> 01:36:44,687
In a few months you'll be an engineer.

1144
01:36:44,767 --> 01:36:45,884
Then your life will be set.

1145
01:36:46,348 --> 01:36:49,711
After that you can hate me all you want.

1146
01:36:57,594 --> 01:36:58,826
This is such a dirty place.

1147
01:37:02,978 --> 01:37:03,974
Asha!

1148
01:37:05,212 --> 01:37:06,146
Asha!

1149
01:37:07,385 --> 01:37:08,893
Asha!

1150
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:14,671
That was such a wonderful scene.
- Asha!

1151
01:37:17,065 --> 01:37:20,777
Now let's go to your room
for the rest of the movie.

1152
01:37:57,748 --> 01:37:58,765
Tie her hands.

1153
01:38:00,529 --> 01:38:01,629
Chinna, don't do this.

1154
01:38:02,314 --> 01:38:03,241
Let go!

1155
01:38:03,601 --> 01:38:04,685
Tie her hands!

1156
01:38:08,140 --> 01:38:11,670
No, Chinna!
I'm sorry, Chinna. Forgive me.

1157
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:13,213
Relax.

1158
01:38:13,293 --> 01:38:14,596
Please let me go.

1159
01:38:14,811 --> 01:38:18,499
Forgive me, Chinna. I made a mistake.

1160
01:38:20,195 --> 01:38:21,821
She was a little girl..

1161
01:38:22,409 --> 01:38:25,136
..that's why I agreed
to put that camera.

1162
01:38:25,216 --> 01:38:27,751
It was a mistake, Chinna.
It was a mistake.

1163
01:38:28,290 --> 01:38:29,653
Forgive me.

1164
01:38:29,805 --> 01:38:33,003
Let me go, Chinna...

1165
01:38:36,199 --> 01:38:37,354
No, Chinna...don't!

1166
01:38:37,873 --> 01:38:41,187
No, Chinna...don't!

1167
01:38:48,161 --> 01:38:49,316
Extinguished.

1168
01:38:54,291 --> 01:38:54,790
One more.

1169
01:38:54,870 --> 01:38:58,013
I'm your investment Chinna,
don't destroy your investment!

1170
01:38:58,093 --> 01:38:59,737
Leave me.

1171
01:38:59,817 --> 01:39:03,003
I got my brother's blessings
to destroy this investment.

1172
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:06,946
Chinna, sorry! I will not do it again.

1173
01:39:07,099 --> 01:39:10,538
Chinna, let me go.
Please! Please! Let me go!

1174
01:39:10,618 --> 01:39:14,066
Chinna, let me go. Forgive me, Chinna.

1175
01:39:14,146 --> 01:39:15,187
Leave me.

1176
01:39:15,860 --> 01:39:16,822
No! No, Chinna!

1177
01:39:16,902 --> 01:39:21,060
Cigarette smoking is injurious
to health. - No, no, no.

1178
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:23,946
Hold her down. - No, no, no.

1179
01:39:25,254 --> 01:39:26,173
Please don't do it...

1180
01:39:51,635 --> 01:39:54,137
I never thought I'll see this day.

1181
01:39:54,375 --> 01:39:56,699
I want five minutes with Lakshmi.

1182
01:39:57,034 --> 01:39:58,937
I apologize. No.

1183
01:40:00,093 --> 01:40:02,115
I know where her father is.

1184
01:40:54,331 --> 01:40:56,980
This is 30,000 which I paid your father.

1185
01:40:59,823 --> 01:41:02,547
And here is another 50,000 for you.

1186
01:41:04,395 --> 01:41:07,336
That is more money than
you'll ever see in your life.

1187
01:41:07,574 --> 01:41:10,255
I promise to change my ways.

1188
01:41:10,894 --> 01:41:13,164
All I'm asking is that
you leave me out of the case.

1189
01:41:13,629 --> 01:41:15,640
You can have both the Reddy brothers.

1190
01:41:15,953 --> 01:41:17,683
Punish those rascals.

1191
01:41:17,943 --> 01:41:19,888
Punish your father.

1192
01:41:19,968 --> 01:41:21,824
He sold you.

1193
01:41:22,894 --> 01:41:23,867
Take it.

1194
01:41:26,342 --> 01:41:27,823
It's your choice, Lakshmi.

1195
01:41:28,775 --> 01:41:31,769
If you want to take the money,
I'll understand.

1196
01:41:32,754 --> 01:41:34,127
Take it, child.

1197
01:41:34,321 --> 01:41:37,705
Get these useless heroic
ideas out of your head.

1198
01:41:38,376 --> 01:41:40,484
What will you get
by sending me to prison?

1199
01:41:41,943 --> 01:41:45,305
I'll be out in a few
months but where will you go?

1200
01:41:45,385 --> 01:41:47,683
Your own family won't take you in.

1201
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:52,581
The court won't award any
money to victims of trafficking.

1202
01:41:52,981 --> 01:41:54,744
The state doesn't
recognize you as a citizen.

1203
01:41:54,824 --> 01:41:56,495
You won't even get an ID card.

1204
01:41:56,575 --> 01:41:58,343
Even dogs have tags.

1205
01:41:58,423 --> 01:42:00,257
You'll have none.

1206
01:42:00,463 --> 01:42:02,192
If you continue this case..

1207
01:42:02,365 --> 01:42:04,744
..the whole world
will know what you are.

1208
01:42:05,781 --> 01:42:09,219
A life of anonymity is better
than a life as a prostitute. ????

1209
01:42:09,792 --> 01:42:11,781
Take my money and start a new life..

1210
01:42:11,861 --> 01:42:14,375
..somewhere with your sisters. Take it.

1211
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:20,527
You're absolutely right.

1212
01:42:22,764 --> 01:42:25,337
I would have taken your
offer if you were a man.

1213
01:42:27,921 --> 01:42:29,661
But you're a woman.

1214
01:42:31,618 --> 01:42:33,434
How can a woman do this?

1215
01:42:42,893 --> 01:42:46,092
All these years, and the problem was..

1216
01:42:46,298 --> 01:42:47,855
..staring me right in the face.

1217
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:52,286
Sometimes in my mouth,
sometimes between my legs..

1218
01:42:53,011 --> 01:42:54,513
..but it was right there..

1219
01:42:57,724 --> 01:42:59,237
..and I couldn't see it.

1220
01:43:02,589 --> 01:43:05,237
The disease and the
cure had the same solution.

1221
01:43:09,962 --> 01:43:12,114
I'm sure you appreciate
the humor in this situation.

1222
01:43:13,443 --> 01:43:15,400
The disease and the cure..

1223
01:43:17,087 --> 01:43:19,541
..one stroke to solve everything!

1224
01:43:33,238 --> 01:43:36,093
I'm strong enough to
survive you and this world..

1225
01:43:40,622 --> 01:43:41,822
But who should I live for?

1226
01:44:28,589 --> 01:44:29,778
Chinna.

1227
01:44:30,902 --> 01:44:32,210
Chinna.

1228
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:36,633
Chinna.

1229
01:44:52,677 --> 01:44:54,893
Shall we? It's time to go.

1230
01:45:06,947 --> 01:45:11,109
All charges against the
accused have been proved.

1231
01:45:11,358 --> 01:45:15,715
The accused are found
guilty under section 4, 5 & 6..

1232
01:45:15,795 --> 01:45:19,910
..of the Immoral Traffic
Act and section 376 of the IPC..

1233
01:45:19,990 --> 01:45:22,428
..are sentenced to 10 years in prison.

1234
01:45:32,504 --> 01:45:34,525
Furthermore, they are ordered to pay..

1235
01:45:34,605 --> 01:45:38,039
..a compensation of two
lakhs to the plaintiff Lakshmi.

1236
01:45:38,266 --> 01:45:41,271
All their assets will
be seized and liquidated...

1237
01:45:41,351 --> 01:45:45,076
..to pay as compensation for
the other plaintiffs in this case.

1238
01:45:46,038 --> 01:45:47,725
The court is adjourned.

1239
01:45:56,006 --> 01:45:56,752
Thank you.

1240
01:45:56,832 --> 01:46:00,607
""The small flower
of the garden knows.""

1241
01:46:00,687 --> 01:46:04,546
""Half the story was still pending.""

1242
01:46:05,186 --> 01:46:10,084
""Small things were happening.""

1243
01:46:12,571 --> 01:46:16,494
""Childhood was still there.""

1244
01:46:16,574 --> 01:46:20,407
""That was targeted.""

1245
01:46:20,487 --> 01:46:30,548
""Come on,
let's return to that house.""

1246
01:46:30,628 --> 01:46:32,148
You guys are celebrating without me?

1247
01:46:36,331 --> 01:46:37,617
One more.. small piece.

1248
01:46:37,697 --> 01:46:40,915
I thought the case will never end.
- ""Let's return home.""

1249
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:42,969
Did you notice Reddy Garu's expression?

1250
01:46:45,109 --> 01:46:46,969
""Let's return home.""

1251
01:46:51,769 --> 01:46:53,510
The media is waiting
to talk to you outside.

1252
01:46:54,061 --> 01:46:55,196
Me?
- Yes.

1253
01:46:57,687 --> 01:46:58,704
What happened?

1254
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:06,552
Let's go out and talk to the media.

1255
01:48:00,509 --> 01:48:01,817
The tears won't stop.

1256
01:48:02,692 --> 01:48:04,130
They're ruining my makeup.

1257
01:48:06,086 --> 01:48:14,119
""Fly away...when you want to fly.""

1258
01:48:18,011 --> 01:48:22,562
""Fly away...when you want to fly.""

1259
01:48:22,736 --> 01:48:27,352
""You don't need wings..
when you have courage.""

1260
01:48:27,432 --> 01:48:31,611
""Let time create its own saga.""

1261
01:48:32,227 --> 01:48:35,729
""Don't try to stop it.""

1262
01:48:36,973 --> 01:48:41,610
""Stuff the sun in your hair and walk.""

1263
01:48:41,690 --> 01:48:46,011
""You will not find any night.""

1264
01:48:46,325 --> 01:48:52,336
""Listen, silly girl, pray for yourself.""

1265
01:48:52,416 --> 01:48:54,941
""You have nobody.""

1266
01:48:58,043 --> 01:48:59,513
Ma'am.

1267
01:49:02,519 --> 01:49:05,125
How do you feel?
You're a hero now.

1268
01:49:13,070 --> 01:49:15,718
""O Lord.""

1269
01:49:18,010 --> 01:49:19,373
""O Lord.""

1270
01:49:20,183 --> 01:49:23,092
""O Lord.""

1271
01:49:23,481 --> 01:49:28,767
""O Lord.""

1272
01:49:29,351 --> 01:49:31,967
""O Lord.""

1273
01:49:34,810 --> 01:49:37,567
""O Lord.""

1274
01:49:37,647 --> 01:49:40,464
""O Lord.""

1275
01:49:40,544 --> 01:49:44,539
""O Lord bless us with Your grace.""

1276
01:49:44,619 --> 01:49:46,139
""O Lord.""

1277
01:49:46,219 --> 01:49:48,896
""O Lord.""

1278
01:49:48,976 --> 01:49:51,761
""O Lord.""

1279
01:49:51,841 --> 01:49:55,393
""O Lord release us from this debt.""

1280
01:49:55,718 --> 01:50:03,447
""O Lord...give us relief.""

1281
01:50:03,675 --> 01:50:08,756
""O Lord...give us relief.""

1282
01:50:09,242 --> 01:50:14,583
""O Lord...You're the benevolent one.""

1283
01:50:14,663 --> 01:50:20,507
""O Lord...
shower Your benevolence on us.""

1284
01:50:20,587 --> 01:50:26,171
""O Lord...You're the benevolent one.""

1285
01:50:26,251 --> 01:50:31,760
""O Lord...
shower Your benevolence on us.""

1286
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:36,842
""O Lord...at least give us..""

1287
01:50:37,393 --> 01:50:41,598
""..the right to live.""

1288
01:50:43,177 --> 01:50:48,708
""O Lord...You're the benevolent one.""

1289
01:50:48,788 --> 01:50:54,291
""O Lord...
shower Your benevolence on us.""

1290
01:51:10,874 --> 01:51:14,853
""There is a Goddess in everyone.""

1291
01:51:15,436 --> 01:51:18,636
""There is a Mariam in everyone.""

1292
01:51:27,814 --> 01:51:33,360
""There's a Radha
in everyone...and a Sita.""

1293
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:38,300
""But where isn't there
a Ram...or a Krishna in us.""

1294
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:41,036
""What's this reality?""

1295
01:51:41,116 --> 01:51:44,917
""They have to pay
a price every moment..""

1296
01:51:44,997 --> 01:51:46,776
""..in every lifetime.""

1297
01:51:46,856 --> 01:51:49,533
""They have equal rights.""

1298
01:51:49,613 --> 01:51:53,165
""But all they get is a strand.""

1299
01:51:53,245 --> 01:51:55,986
""They are mere toys for you.""

1300
01:51:56,066 --> 01:51:59,316
""So why play this double-sided game?""

1301
01:51:59,396 --> 01:52:04,009
""They sky belongs to them just as much.""

1302
01:52:04,993 --> 01:52:10,463
""Even they have a right to
walk with their head held high.""

1303
01:52:10,712 --> 01:52:15,966
""O Lord...You're the benevolent one.""

1304
01:52:16,279 --> 01:52:21,944
""O Lord...
shower Your benevolence on us.""

1305
01:52:22,024 --> 01:52:27,512
""O Lord...at least give us..""

1306
01:52:27,592 --> 01:52:32,959
""..the right to live.""

1307
01:52:33,284 --> 01:52:38,830
""O Lord...You're the benevolent one.""

1308

""O Lord...
shower Your benevolence on us.""

- That's amazing. 
- So, let's get started?

13
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,930
What do you do, son?

14
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,460
He does Whatsapp.

Don't we all!

Come here, dear.

Good boy.

What's your name?

00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,970
Bittu!

26
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,420
Frauds!

27
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,780
You post a handsome 
looking picture of him..

28
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,980
..but he turned out to be a bald guy.

29
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,580

- Get lost!

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,140
Stop it, Goldie.

34
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,580
- Bloody hoggers. 
- Here's your cheap Samosa, oldie!

Meet the Papa Kohli.

A clerk at Delhi 
Municipal Cooperation.

In the past five years, 
his hair has turned grey..

38
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,420
..trying to find a match for me.

39
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,260
You are an oldie!

40
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,900
- Your son is an oldie and a baldie! 
- Oh really?

41
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,540
Don't you have a mirror at home?

42
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,160
Where's your hair, you baldie!

43
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,450
That's my mom.

44
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,030
She still believes that I am quite 
handsome, even if the world doesn't.

00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,940
Even after 50 rejections, 
she hasn't lost hope.

00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,060
- Baldie! Baldie! Baldie! 
- All of you are so gross!

00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,820
- You.. 
- Mummy, let's go.

50
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,660
- Don't come here again. 
- Come on, get lost!

51
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,460
- Come on, get inside. 
- You get lost from here.

52
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,180
I'll make you go bald if 
you ever bring a proposal again.

53
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,660
- Stop! Let me put a jinx on her. 
- Come on, let's go from here.

54
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,060
- Go ahead. Come on. 
- Let me put a jinx on her.

55
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,740
May every male in your 
family be forever bald.

56
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,820
Please don't ask us to meet 
such disgusting families again.

57
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,260
I agree. They looked 
like a family of hooligans.

58
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,300
- It is not so. - My son has 
a narrow escape. Good riddance.

59
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,180
You know so many people. 
Why can't you find us a good match?

60
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,380
What is this?

61
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,540
Did a crow do that or a pigeon?

62
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,900
- What? 
- Shit.

63
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,020
- Do you have to say that? 
- But it is shit. Have a look.

64
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,900
Oh, I got it.

65
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,900
- Rajni is behind this. 
- This shit?

66
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,180
- No, black magic. - Come on, 
how do you expect Rajni to sit here?

67
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,660
You might think that 
she is very naive..

68
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,500
..but she keeps doing 
black magic all the time.

69
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,500
Whatever.

70
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,460
- Brother, please introduce us 
to Mr. Shastri. - Okay.

71
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,580
He predicted that Trump 
would be America's Prime Minister.

72
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,580
And it came true.

73
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,740
Mummy, he's the President, 
not the Prime Minister.

74
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,380
He is something, right?

75
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,900
- Don't argue with me, Goldie. 
- You keep crushing the candies.

76
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,780
- This isn't Candy Crush, papa. 
- He behaves as if he is some minister.

77
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:22,660
Look, his planetary positions 
bypassing the wedding platform..

78
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,740
..will take a shortcut 
through asceticism..

79
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,140
..and lead him directly to Moksa.

80
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,180
Great.

81
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,260
Amazing.

82
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,980
That means everything is fine.

83
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,980
This means if he doesn't 
get married before he turns 31..

84
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,060
..then he will forever 
lead an ascetic life.

85
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,420
In English, it's called..

86
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,420
- Celebrate. 
- Not celebrate, celibate.

87
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,980
- We will celebrate. 
- What?

88
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,940
Why will we celebrate?

89
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,300
It's not celebrate, it's celibate.

90
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,780
This means he will 
stay single all his life.

91
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,540
He will never get married.

92
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,940
- What? 
- Yes.

93
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,900
What are you saying, Guruji?

94
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,180
It's not me, 
his planetary positions suggest that.

95
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,140
Please don't put this on me.

96
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,860
- This is so wrong. 
- No..

97
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,620
- Whether it's wrong or right, 
it is what is it is. - Don't cry, Guddi.

98
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,260
- This is a big thing. 
- Mummy..

99
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,660
- What is trhis? 
- He is my eldest son.

100
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,580
Please don't cry.

101
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,620
- Eldest or youngest doesn't matter. 
- How will the youngest one..

102
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,900
- Please, don't cry.. 
- ..get married if he doesn't?

103
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,780
- Please calm her down. 
- Every mother has a dream..

104
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,740
- ..of getting her son married. - Please 
don't cry. I am begging you not to.

105
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,540
- Is there a solution? 
- There is.

106
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,340
Get him married before he turns 31.

107
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,820
This is the solution.

108
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,420
Okay.

109
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,340
That can be done.

110
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,180
It's okay, son. Okay?

111
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,860
Give the offerings to everyone.

112
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,940
- Celebrate. 
- Celebrate.

113
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,420
""My nose ring is trying 
to say something..""

114
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,420
Come on, man.

115
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,580
This is Joginder's fault.

116
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,660
Mummy, it's the fault of 
that 5-year-old picture and the cap.

117
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,220
It's not like we love to lie.

118
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,140
No one's ready to meet a bald guy.

119
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,020
I mean that once they meet the boy, 
they might like him, his family.

120
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,500
And things might eventually work out.

121
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,740
Someone tell me what's 
the use of hair anyway.

122
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,700
They are useless, 
just like fingernails.

123
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,020
He is a good guy. 
He has a government job.

124
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,900
He is a professor in college. 
What else do they want?

125
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,180
Don't worry.

126
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,220
Nirmala has some herbal oil.

127
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,780
Apply that and you will 
have hair sprouting in three days.

128
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,340
- I guarantee that. 
- The hair oil won't help.

129
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,380
I think you should 
go for hair transplant.

130
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,540
Don't you dare go for 
hair transplant, Chaman.

131
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,500
- But.. 
- Do you know how risky it is?

132
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,260
- Surinder's nephew got it 
done last year. - And?

133
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,620
He passed away.

134
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,940
- Really? 
- Yes.

135
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,780
You are under my oath.

136
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,860
We wouldn't have to 
go hunting for a girl..

137
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,620
..if only he would have 
opted for love marriage.

138
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,020
You know, we had a love 
marriage way back in 1986.

139
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,180
He's useless.

140
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,900
At least try.

141
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,820
Why don't you just keep 
quiet and cut the salad?

142
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,140
- Fine. 
- Don't stress yourself, son.

143
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,540
I'll find such a lovely girl for you..

144
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,980
..that the whole of Rajouri 
will burn with jealousy.

145
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,060
Why not go for the 
whole of Delhi, Guddi?

146
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,580
- Vivid imaginations don't get 
taxed as yet.- Please, keep quiet.

147
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,100
No one needs to find anyone.

148
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,180
Did I ask you to?

149
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,660
Oh really? 
So you want to be a 'celebrity'?

150
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,780
Mummy, it's not celebrity, 
it's celibate.

151
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,300
Actors are called celebrity.

152
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,620
- Don't interrupt me. - Why don't you 
say single and end the argument?

153
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,260
Fine, you will end up being that.

154
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,420
You know you have a flaw.

155
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,700
So what? 
People can be happy without marriage.

156
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,860
Really? Tell me one name.

157
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,940
Salman Khan.

158
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,100
Their case is different.

159
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,820
They at least get some..

160
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,260
What?

161
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,700
Girls. They can find girls.

162
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,100
- They have had many options. 
- Yes. Right!

163
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,860
I can be happy even 
without a girl in my life.

164
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,620
Yeah, right.

165
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,220
Pushpa.

166
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,780
I've told you a thousand 
times to dress decently.

167
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,460
- There are three males in here. 
- Calm down. This is not her fault.

168
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,300
This jar will come flying at you next.

169
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,700
Water, please.

170
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,660
You want water? Here's your water.

171
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,480
'Suhani and Piyush got engaged.'

172
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,060
'Hey, congratulations guys.'

173
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,520
'Congrats.'

174
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,320
'S**t! The last one is also down.'

175
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,000
'Everyone from our 
batch is married now.'

176
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,850
'Hey not yet, 
our Chaman is still pending.'

177
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,920
'Is he still thinking about marriage?'

178
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,600
'I thought he must 
have given up by now.'

179
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,720
Hello?

180
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,360
I was waiting for your call.

181
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,120
What?

182
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,800
Listen, can we meet tomorrow?

183
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,360
My friend has an empty flat.

184
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,880
Let's go there.

185
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,000
Do you think I am that kind of a guy?

186
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,220
Have I ever even touched you?

187
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,320
Come on now, give me a kiss.

188
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,880
A small one?

189
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,520
You know I cannot sleep without one.

190
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,740
I feel restless.

191
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,680
Give me a small one. 
Please give it.

192
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,000
This is meant for the cheek.

193
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,880
Now one on my lips.

194
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,080
What are you doing?

195
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,480
Goldie, I can't find my slippers.

196
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,800
Can't find your slippers?

197
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,160
Take mine.

198
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,000
Pass them to me.

199
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,080
Here.

200
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,760
Hello!

201
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,680
What happened!

202
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,080
You are supposed to sleep on bed, 
not tittle-tattle.

203
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
Get out. Leave.

204
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,040
Fine. I am leaving.

205
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,840
It's not like I love 
to sleep with you.

206
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,800
Papa asked me to sleep 
here till you don't get married.

207
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,400
Said we would save some electricity.

208
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,120
Now it seems like I'll be 
spending the rest of my life here.

209
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,480
Stop blabbering and leave. 
Tell papa, I'll pay the bill.

210
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,360
- Hello? 
- Disgusting!

211
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,520
- No, there was some disturbance. 
- Go.

212
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,080
He's just frustrated. Nothing else.

213
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,120
""Have no doubt, 
this moon stands out""

214
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,440
""No hair on the head, 
I feel so restless""

215
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,840
Don't worry about that..

216
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,800
No, I am just massaging 
my head with some oil.

217
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,560
""Have no doubt, 
this moon stands out""

218
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,200
""No hair on the head, 
I feel so restless""

219
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,160
Chaman, pay respect to your 
grandfather before you leave. Okay?

220
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,960
""No hair to provide shade""

221
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,640
""No protection from the sun, mate""

222
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,440
""Overshadowing my looks always, 
what a fate""

223
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,440
""Everyone is awed at the sight""

224
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,200
""This moon shines bright""

225
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,080
Goldie took the car, again?

226
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,280
Who needs the car more, 
that useless idler or me?

227
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,880
I am the one who makes 70,000 a month.

228
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,040
So what? 
Why don't you take the scooter?

229
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,400
It's his age to have some fun.

230
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,920
The car will come in handy to him.

231
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,400
You only use it as a conveyance.

232
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,360
No, I was talking to Chaman.

233
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,480
""This moon shines bright""

234
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,640
""Autumn is distressed, 
life is a mess""

235
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,600
""I will dance, 
if I loss them by chance""

236
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,680
""Autumn is distressed, 
life is a mess""

237
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,760
""I will dance, 
if I loss them by chance""

238
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:11,480
""This cruel world taunts me""

239
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:18,240
""This barren land 
has been earned by me""

240
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:25,600
""I cause a commotion everywhere I go""

241
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,640
""Everyone is awed at the sight""

242
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,800
""This moon shines bright""

243
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,560
""Whether it's day or night""

244
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,680
""This moon shines bright""

245
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,640
""Mirror mocks me""

246
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,160
""Everyone ridicules me""

247
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,240
""Everyone is awed at the sight""

248
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,760
""This moon shines bright""

249
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,440
""This moon shines bright""

250
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:08,680
""This moon shines bright""

251
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,810
""This moon shines bright""

252
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,320
This is the result 
of tolerating atrocities.

253
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,720
By being gentle, man losses terror..

254
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,960
Baldie!

255
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,520
Baldhead!

256
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,960
Sir, what is the result 
of tolerating atrocities?

257
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,360
This looks like you.

258
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,880
This is you.

259
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,600
Nice.

260
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,680
Thank you, sir.

261
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,640
Sir, he was misbehaving. 
He was making fun of me.

262
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,040
What did you say?

263
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,720
That wasn't me, sir.

264
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,600
Sir?

265
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,480
Sir, I want a day off tomorrow.

266
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,600
I need to drop my wife 
off to her sister's place.

267
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,800
Okay.

268
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,040
Thank you, sir.

269
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,760
Wife, sir.

270
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,360
I got the permission.

271
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,960
His wife or someone else's?

272
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,000
- Sir.. 
- What do you think?

273
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,480
What does he talk about with his wife, 
seven years after marriage?

274
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,440
Okay.

275
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,840
What were you saying?

276
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,120
Nothing, sir.

277
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,840
Sir..

278
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,400
Sir..

279
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,120
Baldie.

280
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,000
- But sir, I didn't say it. 
- Shut up.

281
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,520
Your parents send you here for this?

282
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,120
Bloody good-for-nothing loafers.

283
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,600
They'll either keep staring at the 
girls or troubling their professors.

284
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,320
He's as old as your father.

285
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,200
Sir, I am just 30.

286
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,890
I am just be seven or 
eight years older than him.

287
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,520
Chaman, you look a tad matured.

288
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,920
Fine.

289
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,960
- Sir! 
- 1000 rupees. Right away.

290
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,800
Sorry.

291
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,040
- Pay up. 
- Next time, sir.

292
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,280
- Pay up. 
- Sir..

293
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,360
I don't have change, sir.

294
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,160
You do have any change?

295
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,920
No, sir.

296
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,080
- I'll pay it tomorrow, sir.- 
Shut up.

297
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,040
Let's do one thing..

298
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,080
You say it again leave this here.

299
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
What do I say, sir?

300
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,200
This is wrong, sir.

301
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,000
How can you let him insult me again?

302
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,800
Chaman, I have fined him.

303
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,610
Let's compromise and end the matter.

304
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,640
How can I say it, sir?

305
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,880
Then you should have change on you.

306
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,920
I am not running a grocery 
store here to have change handy.

307
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,640
I am getting late for class. 
Say it and end the matter.

308
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,840
Sir..

309
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,920
Baldie.

310
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,200
Raj, when did you get married?

311
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,920
Seven years back.

312
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,440
We'll be celebrating 
our anniversary next month.

313
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,720
Great! Arranged marriage?

314
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,960
No, sir. Love marriage.

315
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,440
We fell in love.

316
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,120
How? 
I mean, how did it happen?

317
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,240
Where did you two first meet?

318
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,320
At a wedding.

319
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,720
- At a wedding? 
- Yes.

320
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,040
My friend was getting married.

321
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,520
She was the bride's friend.

322
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,560
That's where we saw each 
other for the first time.

323
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,760
We fell in love on the dance floor.

324
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,040
And then, we got married.

325
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,960
You found love at 
your friend's wedding?

326
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,400
Yes, that's what friend's 
weddings are for.

327
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,640
You get free alcohol and 
you get to flirt with girls.

328
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,480
Where's my tea?

329
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,240
This feels so dry without it!

330
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,790
Yes?

331
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,070
Join us, bro.

332
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,550
Shikha was just joking.

333
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,550
I'll apologise on her behalf.

334
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,070
No, you guys have fun.

335
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,470
Why are you doing this?

336
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,670
What's Piyush and Suhani's fault?

337
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,520
Please join us.

338
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,840
At the last minute? 
I don't even have a suit ready.

339
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,690
Come in casuals then.

340
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,460
Else, I'll arrange for a suit for you.

341
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,660
Fine, let me see. I'll let you know.

342
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,820
I'll come up with something.

343
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,780
Bye.

344
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,020
Wait right there, Chaman.

345
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,540
Apply the oil before you leave.

346
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,820
What are you doing, mummy? 
It won't work.

347
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,620
I have tried a million things already.

348
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,300
Where are you going all dressed up?

349
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,980
To a friend's wedding.

350
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,340
Aren't you tired of dancing 
at your friends' weddings?

351
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,860
Why do you always 
keep taunting me, papa?

352
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,540
I am not taunting you. I am only 
stating a fact. Don't waste your time.

353
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,020
What's more important, 
dancing at your friend's wedding..

354
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,180
..or finding a girl for yourself?

355
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,660
That's why I am going there. 
To flirt..

356
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,740
To find a girl.

357
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,420
Flirt, eh!

358
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,180
There comes the professor.

359
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,820
Looking good, professor.

360
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,500
- All good? 
- All good.

361
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,660
Managed to arrange a suit then?

362
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,660
- Join us. 
- Chaman sir, please forgive me.

363
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,140
You felt so bad about what I said?

364
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,140
It's cool.

365
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,540
It's cool? 
Then you just wait and watch.

366
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,220
I'll surely set you 
up with someone tonight.

367
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,300
Great.

368
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,460
- There are quite a few 
beautiful girls here. - Really?

369
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,220
""The kohl in your 
eyes is worth a million""

370
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,620
""Your big bright eyes 
are targeting billions""

371
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:26,380
""Stealthily stealing hearts, 
your outfit, my dear""

372
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,260
""Leaving everyone awestruck, 
your outfit, my dear""

373
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:36,660
""It's killing the boys, 
your outfit, my dear""

374
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,220
""Gucci and Prada 
guys are also your fan""

375
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,540
""All the brands want 
you to promote them""

376
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,620
""Mesmerises even the young lads, 
your outfit, my dear""

377
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,620
""It's killing the boys, 
your outfit, my dear""

378
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,860
""Leaving everyone awestruck, 
your outfit, my dear""

379
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:02,660
""It's killing the boys, 
your outfit, my dear""

380
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,020
You see that?

381
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,500
He's on a roll.

382
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,900
So professor..

383
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,900
Where's your girl?

384
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,860
Where's my bro's chick?

385
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,820
I'm chatting with her.

386
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,700
She is busy with her friends.

387
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,020
She said she'd meet 
me after the wedding.

388
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,740
Well done, bro!

389
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,860
She seems too busy, don't you think?

390
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,700
What the duck!

391
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,500
My bro's girl..

392
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,540
Someone's getting cosy 
with her behind the bushes.

393
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,660
Move aside.

394
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,420
- That's not her. 
- That's her.

395
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,340
- That's not her. 
- That's her.

396
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,020
- Let's go. 
- No. That's not her.

397
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,300
- Let's go. 
- No. That's not her.

398
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,420
Let's go, that's her.

399
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,660
- I'll beat you. 
- Let's go.

400
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,900
You bloodsucking Dracula, 
let go of her.

401
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,900
This is the wrong guy.

402
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,540
Your guy is over there.

403
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,700
That's Goldie. Let him go. 
He's Chaman's brother.

404
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,900
Chaman's brother?

405
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,300
Don't you have any shame?

406
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,380
You are hitting on 
your brother's wife?

407
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,420
Wife? What wife?

408
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,100
Isn't he your husband?

409
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,860
Professor!

410
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,940
What is this nonsense?

411
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,060
What the hell are you doing there?

412
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,980
Come here and handle your own mess.

413
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,420
Let it go, Rathee.

414
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,940
It's cool. It happens.

415
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,940
It's cool?

416
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,460
We aren't still that westernised, 
you dunce..

417
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,020
..that brothers can 
take turns at this.

418
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,460
Can someone please tell 
me what the hell is happening.

419
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,740
Come here, professor.

420
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,780
I just don't understand 
these Delhi girls.

421
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,180
Excuse me, South Delhi.

422
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,980
I am from South Ex. Okay?

423
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,340
South Ex.

424
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,700
What are you doing here?

425
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,900
Speak up.

426
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,140
We just came here for the free food.

427
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,860
We didn't know that 
it's your friend's wedding.

428
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,580
We wouldn't have come here otherwise.

429
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,660
- He planned to devour the girl as well. 
- No.

430
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,180
You are welcome to continue 
with your family drama.

431
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,140
Will you please let me go?

432
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,420
Madam, he is your boyfriend.

433
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,700
Go with him.

434
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,900
What boyfriend?

435
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,020
Weren't you and he hook.. talking?

436
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,460
Talking about?

437
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,140
He's been harassing me.

438
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,100
He has been following me everywhere.

439
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,540
He waited outside the 
ladies washroom for 15 minutes.

440
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,500
He has been messaging me non-stop.

441
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,140
I replied after he sent 20 messages.

442
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,860
I am sick and tired of this drama.

443
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,100
I am leaving.

444
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,660
Bloody hooligans.

445
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,820
She's your girlfriend?

446
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,900
No, I met her at the snack stall.

447
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,340
And you groped her?

448
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,980
You are lucky that 
you are his brother.

449
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,820
I'd have stuffed you 
in the boot and dumped you..

450
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,220
..in the middle of nowhere otherwise.

451
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,940
Where?

452
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,420
Sorry.

453
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,390
Sorry.

454
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,340
Nothing. He was just 
a coward from Haryana.

455
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,500
Two whacks and he learnt his lesson.

456
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,420
That girl?

457
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,940
She was poison.

458
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,740
Poison.

459
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,140
I couldn't have a proper dinner so..

460
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,100
Wait, I'll serve you dinner.

461
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,300
- Goldie! 
- Mummy!

462
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,660
Let me go.

463
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,380
Papa! Let me go, bro!

464
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,500
Papa!

465
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,420
Help me!

466
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,940
Are you hurt, bro?

467
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:51,420
- You bloody.. 
- Help!

468
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,340
- Wait, I'll teach you a lesson. 
- Help me, he's going to kill me.

469
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,540
Oh my God, what happened?

470
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,500
- I am warning you, get down 
right this minute. - What happened?

471
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,420
Can't you see? He is possessed.

472
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,900
Yes, I am possessed. 
Let me show you how.

473
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,820
You creep!

474
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,500
- Shame on you! 
- What are you doing?

475
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,780
How dare you hit your 
father with your shoes!

476
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,700
- Mummy, help me! 
- Shut up. You too shut up.

477
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,740
- You shut up. - Strange woman, 
what is wrong with you?

478
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,300
- Stop! 
- Don't turn this into a fish market!

479
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,900
Why are you hitting him? Stop!

480
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,940
Don't fight..

481
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,900
- Stop! Why did you close the door? 
- Where are they?

482
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,540
- Go after them. 
- Move aside.

483
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,100
- Stop! I am warning you. 
- I'll get hurt!

484
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,140
You bloody..!

485
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,780
- Where are you running? 
- I'll get hurt.

486
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,220
Stop.

487
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,260
Brother, I beg you..

488
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,940
I am telling you. 
Just say sorry.

489
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,780
I am telling you, I'll beat you.

490
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,060
Stop it. Stop it.

491
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,380
Leave it.

492
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,980
Mummy..

493
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,100
- I didn't beat you yet. 
- No.

494
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,580
You want to consume poison? Right?

495
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,940
- I'll give you poison. Wait! 
- No.

496
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,180
- I don't want to consume poison. 
- Chaman!

497
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,300
- You want to consume poison? 
- What is going on?

498
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,300
- You.. 
- Stop it, Chaman!

499
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,020
- I don't want it. 
- Chaman! Chaman!

500
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,340
- Chaman! Let him go! Let him go! 
- What are you doing?

501
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,460
Let him go! Come on.

502
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,580
- What are you doing? Let him go! 
- I am warning you.

503
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,140
Shameless! Rascal!

504
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,660
- Come here. 
- What happened? Tell me?

505
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,510
- What happened? 
- He's a bloody pervert.

506
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,000
What's this commotion about 
in the middle of the night?

507
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,060
- What's going on, Mr. Kohli? 
- What is going to happen?

508
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,580
Can't you see we 
are getting embarrassed?

509
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,620
- Do you want to embarrass us 
in front of the society? - Stop it.

510
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,220
- Come down. - We've been staying in 
Rajouri since three generations.

511
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,260
At least take your forefathers' 
reputation into consideration.

512
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,780
Get down before you dent the car!

513
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,340
He has already caused a lot of dents.

514
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,380
Stop it.

515
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,600
At least tell us what 
happened between you two.

516
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,780
Speak up.

517
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,500
Ask him.

518
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,260
Chaman, tell us what happened.

519
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,660
- Speak up. 
- Tell us.

520
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,060
Strange fellow. He just left. 
You tell us.

521
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,980
How much for the taro root?

522
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,340
- 15 for a quarter of a kilo. 
- Okay.

523
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,340
Hello.

524
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,220
Mr. Kohli?

525
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,820
He is 30, right?

526
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,300
- Chaman? 
- Yes.

527
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,440
There is a lot of 
fire within at this age.

528
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,060
Do you understand?

529
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,420
So, he might go to different 
places to find relief.

530
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,860
You know at those kinds of places?

531
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,820
He could get AIDS.

532
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,380
That's why rapes happen. 
Because of frustration.

533
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,420
Oh come on, sister.

534
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,780
- Who says such things? 
- Shut up.

535
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,030
I am talking to him.

536
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:16,780
I mean we should find a solution 
before something untoward happens.

537
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,140
We will need to find a solution.

538
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,040
I'll go find a solution.

539
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,580
Hurry up.

540
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,260
Testosterone, medication..

541
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,150
Release..

542
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,700
What have you been blabbering since 
morning? What do you plan to discuss?

543
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,260
You won't understand, 
let me handle this.

544
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,020
But what are you about to do?

545
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,980
Do my duty as a father.

546
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,580
Do you understand?

547
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,900
May I come in, son?

548
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,420
Do you need to ask?

549
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,020
Yes, right!

550
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,020
Gulab Jamun (Sweets) for you.

551
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,580
Good.

552
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,020
Good.

553
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,820
What is it?

554
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,660
Nothing.

555
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,260
I thought we should 
have a father-son talk.

556
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,700
- A father-son talk? 
- Yes.

557
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,220
What kind of a talk is that?

558
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,500
Son, I should have 
had this talk 12 years ago.

559
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,780
I am a little late, 
but better late than never.

560
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,900
What are you talking about?

561
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,420
Look son, I was 24 when I got married.

562
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,980
Before that, I used to go 
for strolls in the neighbourhood.

563
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,460
You will soon turn 31.

564
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,740
Your body is filled 
with.. what is it called?

565
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,820
Tes..

566
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,620
Give me a minute. I forgot.

567
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,820
I had memorised everything, 
but I forgot. Wait.

568
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,380
Tes-tos-terone.

569
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,100
Yes. There are a few elements..

570
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,260
- Papa, please, I know. 
- I know that you know.

571
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,900
But you don't know that when 
their numbers start increasing..

572
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,540
..you feel a strange fire. Yes.

573
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,940
- Fire? 
- Yes.

574
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,980
Are you feeling alright?

575
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,700
Why are you saying 
such strange things?

576
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,900
This isn't strange. 
This is correct education.

577
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:04,540
It is because of this that you 
wanted to crack open Goldie's skull.

578
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,420
Papa, stop this.

579
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,340
You know how worried 
we are because of you?

580
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,020
You scared us yesterday. We 
thought you'd do some serious damage.

581
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,540
- What have I damaged? 
- No, you haven't.

582
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,300
You actually cannot.

583
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,700
But you will be forced by them to.

584
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,740
- Yes. 
- Who them?

585
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,980
The testo-tentrone.

586
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,700
- What testentrone? 
- The testentron..

587
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,500
Whatever it's called. 
Show me your phone.

588
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,820
Wait.

589
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,180
Where is it?

590
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,580
Here it is. Have a look.

591
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,860
- Tinder? 
- Yes, Tinder.

592
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,740
Learn to take full 
advantage of technology.

593
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,860
30-year-old virgin boy orders 
Gulab Jamun (sweets) online.

594
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,300
I am not a virgin. 
You can have it checked if you want.

595
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,660
Have it checked, yeah right!

596
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,860
I am your father. I know everything.

597
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,740
Mummy!

598
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,100
Are you crazy?

599
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,500
Oh man, they are all going crazy.

600
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,460
Raj, any other place?

601
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,100
Perhaps where your friend, 
brother, cousin fell in love?

602
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,780
In office.

603
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,220
- In office? 
- Yes.

604
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,420
Sir, maximum number of my 
friends fell in love in office.

605
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,780
You work together, you talk, 
you mingle. That's it.

606
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,660
There are so many 
female teachers here..

607
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,940
..but all the male 
teachers are dumbos.

608
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,260
College closes at four.

609
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,420
You can easily go out for tea, 
coffee or a movie and get the girl.

610
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,180
- Really? 
- Yes.

611
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,900
So guys, you need to understand that 
law of diminishing marginal utility..

612
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,340
..is the most important 
law of business.

613
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,540
You guys didn't 
understand the concept?

614
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,740
What is so difficult 
about this concept?

615
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,420
It's the simplest law of economics.

616
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,860
I'll give a test on this 
concept tomorrow, alright?

617
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,620
Are you guys ready for that?

618
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,620
You don't understand..

619
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,060
- Madam. 
- Thank you.

620
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,500
Sir..

621
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,940
They call this leave encashment?

622
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,060
I wonder when this 
probation period will end.

623
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,460
Don't stress over it. 
It will end soon.

624
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,540
If it doesn't happen soon, 
I'll get married.

625
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,100
I'm soon going to turn 30. 
I have waited enough.

626
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,940
Madam! 
Ekta, what are you doing this evening?

627
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,020
After college?

628
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,740
Nothing. I'll be going home.

629
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,420
I was wondering, 
can we go out for a cup of coffee?

630
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,620
Yes, I heard the canteen 
guy brought a new coffee machine.

631
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,980
- He did? 
- Yes.

632
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,500
No I meant, 
can we go out in the evening?

633
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,700
For a movie, for dinner?

634
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,900
If you're free.

635
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,220
Sir, I already have a 
plan tonight with my boyfriend.

636
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,620
Not a problem. Next time.

637
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,460
Okay.

638
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,700
Renu madam, 
what time is the staff meeting?

639
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,100
- At 3:00 p.m. sir. 
- At three?

640
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,460
They have a meeting every 
week for no reason at all.

641
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,500
I was wondering, 
can we go out in the evening?

642
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,980
Maybe to Cannaught Place?

643
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,620
Not possible, sir.

644
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,500
Someone's coming over to see me today.

645
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,940
So you know, I'll have 
to make arrangements and stuff.

646
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,300
I know.

647
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,340
Is it confirmed?

648
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,620
Yes.

649
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,860
Are you coming along?

650
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,940
No, you go ahead. I have some work.

651
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,620
Okay. See you.

652
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,660
Did you get the lecture 
schedule for the second year?

653
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,900
No, I already enquired.

654
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,340
- Late as usual. 
- Right.

655
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,620
The new English teacher.

656
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,540
- He is so handsome. 
- Indeed.

657
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,940
""Everyone is awed at the sight""

658
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,520
""This moon shines bright""

659
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,490
500, 1000.. 
Keep it down.

660
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:21,490
500, 1000, 1500.. 
Around 4000 I think.

661
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,570
You'll need 4000 grafts.

662
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,410
- Grafts? 
- Yes.

663
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:28,170
- Hair roots. 
- Whose hair?

664
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,090
Yours, of course.

665
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,010
Don't worry, 
we'll collect from behind.

666
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,610
Behind where?

667
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,090
The back of your head.

668
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:41,490
If we still fall short, we'll take 
more from your beard, chest, armpits..

669
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,410
Don't worry, we will manage.

670
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,010
This is quite complicated.

671
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,730
It only sounds complicated.

672
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,930
It's quite easy. I do it every day.

673
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,170
It's quite simple.

674
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,090
Don't look up there.

675
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,330
I lost them after I turned 45.

676
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:02,050
Young guys like you need hair.

677
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,970
No hair, no girl.

678
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:11,250
It's 150 per graft, 
so it comes to around 600,000 rupees.

679
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,810
600,000!

680
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:16,250
Doctor, this isn't cancer 
that I'd spend so much.

681
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,570
I'm on a tight budget.

682
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:21,050
We'll get you a loan.

683
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,610
You can pay in 12 easy instalments.

684
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,770
It'll be 60,000 per month.

685
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:28,490
That's almost my monthly salary.

686
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,850
How about something cheaper?

687
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,490
I'll prescribe some pills then.

688
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,050
You'll have to have them lifelong.

689
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,490
Is it safe?

690
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,090
Almost.

691
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:45,970
One out of every 200 might 
get partial or full impotency.

692
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,250
Side effect.

693
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,210
My odds have always been bad.

694
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,530
Any other option?

695
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,130
Then..

696
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,170
There is just one option left.

697
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,530
What?

698
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:24,730
""You shouldn't hide your beauty, 
my love""

699
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:31,250
""You shouldn't hide your beauty, 
my love""

700
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,730
""You shouldn't make 
the boys suffer, my love""

701
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:39,730
""You will have to 
pick someone eventually""

702
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:43,210
""Pray, will you marry me?""

703
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,930
Dharam, recite the poem.

704
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:48,970
""The desire for revolution 
lies in our hearts""

705
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:52,170
""Let us see what strength 
lies in the executioner's arms""

706
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:59,250
[reciting poem]

707
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:02,210
""When the time comes, 
we shall show thee, O heaven""

708
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:05,370
""For why should we tell thee now, 
what lurks in our hearts?""

709
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:08,890
[reciting poem]

710
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,330
What a relief.

711
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:29,170
Sir, I just wanted to say you 
shouldn't take this to your heart.

712
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:32,810
These idle hooligans 
have nothing else to do.

713
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,690
Take care of yourself.

714
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,490
And don't stress over this.

715
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,890
Okay? I'll leave.

716
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,770
Bye, sir. Take care.

717
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,440
Hi sir, are you okay?

718
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,530
Take care of yourself.

719
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:15,660
Oh Chaman Kohli.

720
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,310
Hi! I'm fine. Thank you.

721
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,010
Hi, sir.

722
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:50,250
Hi.

723
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:53,170
Sir, should I address 
you as sir or as Chaman?

724
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,330
No, I'll call you Chomu.

725
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,690
What is it?

726
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,530
You are a first year student, right?

727
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,850
- Yes. 
- What if someone sees us together?

728
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:08,810
Oh come on, Chomu! Can't 
a professor and a student be friends?

729
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,890
Anyway, I don't think 
that you are too old.

730
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,010
How old are you?

731
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,250
- 30. 
- 30?

732
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,570
I'm 20.

733
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:19,890
Close enough.

734
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,250
Let's go.

735
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:25,330
- Come on! 
- Okay.

736
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,410
You know our college's crowd.

737
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,050
All the boys are so creepy.

738
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:39,850
I like sensible, mature men.

739
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,610
You don't need to wear a wig.

740
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,250
You look good just the way you are.

741
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,930
You look like 'The Rock'!

742
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,410
Yes.

743
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:08,010
""Bowled over..""

744
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:11,570
""My heart's lost to you""

745
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:17,450
""A look, and I fell 
head over heels for you""

746
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:20,570
""So beautiful and well bloomed""

747
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,410
""Have come directly from the moon?""

748
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,530
""So beautiful and well bloomed""

749
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,050
""Have come directly from the moon?""

750
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:30,250
""Sometimes you seem 
too good to be true""

751
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:36,370
""Twinkle-twinkle, 
my eyes sparkle when they see you""

752
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:42,410
""Twinkle-twinkle, my eyes..""

753
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:48,370
""Twinkle-twinkle, 
my eyes sparkle when they see you""

754
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:54,650
""Twinkle-twinkle, my eyes..""

755
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:09,250
You know I am only one who 
is still single in my friend circle?

756
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,530
Don't worry.

757
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,730
Everyone finds someone. 
Nandu did too.

758
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:15,530
- Nandu who? 
- My driver.

759
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:17,970
Right.

760
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,010
It's too early for you to 
even think about marriage, right?

761
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,570
Hello! Who says so?

762
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:27,370
My mom was 17 when she got married.

763
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:29,690
Therefore, 
I am already three years late.

764
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:31,290
You are still in the first year.

765
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,530
So?

766
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:35,290
Does the college 
expel married students?

767
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:39,650
My mother completed her 
graduation after marriage.

768
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:43,490
- ""Oh my love, my dove.."" 
- Really?

769
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:46,570
""Your eyes have me floored""

770
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:49,330
""Oh my agile butterfly..""

771
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:52,410
""For you my heart soars""

772
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:55,450
""We are meant to be together, 
that's my only respite""

773
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,410
""I feel fortunate 
to have you in my life""

774
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:01,410
""We are meant to be together, 
that's my only respite""

775
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:04,450
""I feel fortunate 
to have you in my life""

776
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:07,090
""So beautiful and well bloomed""

777
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:09,330
""Have come directly from the moon?""

778
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:11,970
""So beautiful and well bloomed""

779
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,490
""Have come directly from the moon?""

780
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:16,730
""Sometimes you seem 
too good to be true""

781
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:22,770
""Twinkle-twinkle, 
my eyes sparkle when they see you""

782
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:28,770
""Twinkle-twinkle, my eyes..""

783
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:34,850
""Twinkle-twinkle, 
my eyes sparkle when they see you""

784
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:41,170
""Twinkle-twinkle, my eyes..""

785
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,370
'Tara?'

786
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:52,010
'Madamji.'

787
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:55,890
'She is a Muslim.'

788
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:57,490
'She is ours to take.'

789
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:58,810
'No one will touch her.'

790
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:02,810
'We do all the hard work 
and you want to keep the spoils?'

791
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,810
- 'Move aside. 
- Like I said, if..'

792
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:06,170
Chaman.

793
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:09,530
I was wondering..

794
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:14,250
..should we delete 
your profile in shaadi.com?

795
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:18,570
You have already found a girl.

796
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:21,970
We know. 
Goldie saw you two together.

797
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,650
Why don't you tell us who she is?

798
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:30,570
Tell us who she is.

799
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:35,050
Is she even for real?

800
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,290
She is!

801
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:37,490
Now just don't shooting 
questions at me.

802
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:38,850
""Who she is? 
What does she do? What's her name?""

803
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:41,210
""What's her caste? What do 
her parents do? How old is she?""

804
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:42,250
Please.

805
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:47,650
'So, she is a Muslim?'

806
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,690
'There, now she is a Sikh.'

807
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:58,970
'If anyone even looks at her, 
I swear, I'll behead him.'

808
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:02,010
- What did I say wrong? 
- How would I know?

809
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:06,250
They are responsible for this.. 
those 'testentrone'.

810
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:42,530
Hi.

811
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:46,890
What's wrong?

812
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:49,010
All good?

813
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:52,610
Tests begin in four days.

814
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:54,130
I'm going to flunk.

815
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:56,650
Aaina, you didn't 
prepare for the tests?

816
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:02,210
Grandma wasn't keeping well.

817
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:03,530
Oh.

818
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:05,890
I just couldn't concentrate 
on my studies this semester.

819
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:07,930
I need to cover five 
subjects in four days.

820
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:11,570
Even if I do a subject a day, 
I'll have to skip one.

821
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:17,890
You are preparing the test 
questions this semester, right?

822
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:20,850
Yes.

823
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,010
Chomu..

824
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:31,650
If I could get a few questions..

825
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:34,170
No Aaina, I cannot do that.

826
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,210
I'll fail, Chomu.

827
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,570
Why do you treat 
me like other students?

828
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,890
Am I not special to you?

829
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:43,290
You are very special.

830
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:46,930
But.. I cannot leak 
the question paper.

831
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:51,490
Let me teach you.

832
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,170
There is no time.

833
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:54,570
There is a lot of time.

834
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:55,570
No, there isn't.

835
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,770
Just give me the five 
important questions.

836
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:00,330
The test only has five questions.

837
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:01,650
Oh.

838
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:05,010
Then give me 10. 
I'll be prepared, I promise.

839
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:07,090
- Aaina.. 
- Please, Chomu.

840
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:09,250
Please let me know.

841
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:11,330
Please. Please let me know.

842
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:14,770
Would you want me to flunk the tests?

843
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:16,490
No?

844
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:18,410
Please?

845
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:21,090
Chomu, please? 
Please let me know.

846
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:35,330
Look into your own paper.

847
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:07,250
Sister-in-law's cheating!

848
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:08,890
Silence!

849
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:11,010
Nobody will talk.

850
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:12,330
If anybody talks..

851
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:15,530
..that body, another body, 
both the bodies will be thrown out.

852
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:22,650
Sir.

853
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:23,730
Done.

854
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:28,490
Thanks, Choms.

855
00:48:58,610 --> 00:48:59,570
Where are you from?

856
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:09,770
Aaina?

857
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:12,850
Good afternoon, sir.

858
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:17,130
Good afternoon.

859
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:18,850
What is it, sir?

860
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:22,010
May I talk to you?

861
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:24,890
Hop in, babes.

862
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:27,410
Sir?

863
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,810
I'm getting late. 
I need to get home.

864
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:32,570
Bye, sir.

865
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:34,570
Bye, guys.

866
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:45,480
Who is this baldie?

867
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,460
Our Hindi Professor.

868
00:50:58,330 --> 00:50:59,810
Beautiful!

869
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:02,170
- Open the door. 
- Coming, mummy!

870
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:18,650
[reciting poem]

871
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:20,770
Tinder! Tinder! Tinder!

872
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:23,850
You donkey fellow!

873
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:35,730
[reciting poem]

874
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:37,810
Professor's on Tinder!

875
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:41,010
Professor is a womaniser! 
Professor is a womaniser!

876
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:43,330
Professor's on Tinder!

877
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:09,410
- Hello? 
- Hello?

878
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:12,330
Where are you? 
Where have you reached?

879
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:15,170
- I can't locate you. 
- I have reached.

880
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,770
Where are you exactly?

881
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:18,530
Under the dome.

882
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,730
There are a lot of domes here. 
Which one?

883
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:24,330
Under the big dome.

884
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,850
No, I still can't locate you.

885
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:32,570
There's a bald guy standing there 
wearing a white shirt with black pants.

886
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:35,010
Where exactly are you?

887
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,040
Sorry, I couldn't make 
out from the picture posted.

888
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,360
'I wouldn't have showed up 
if he had posted a full body shot.'

889
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,050
'Like I would have if I'd 
seen the buffalo that you are.'

890
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,960
'Fat people should compulsorily 
post a full body shot.'

891
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,480
You too shouldn't have 
posted a close up picture..

892
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,520
So, what brought you to Tinder?

893
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,360
I mean, did you want 
a girlfriend or a hook-up?

894
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,160
A wife.

895
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,440
'Is he insane?'

896
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,200
'Who goes hunting for a wife on Tinder?'

897
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,280
Why are you on Tinder?

898
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:30,400
Well, I just had a breakup 
so I thought about checking it out.

899
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,480
Perhaps, I might find someone.

900
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,680
Perhaps, I might end up liking someone.

901
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,960
Why Tinder?

902
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,400
Why not try the traditional route?

903
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,440
'You are an oldie!' 
'Your son is an oldie and a baldie!'

904
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,160
I tried, but I didn't like any.

905
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,840
There is a shortage 
of good girls these days.

906
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,280
I am not someone who compromises.

907
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:55,810
'You won't compromise?'

908
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:57,890
'You are a compromise.'

909
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,170
They are not that hard to find.

910
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:05,730
Why did you breakup?

911
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,170
I wanted to say something.

912
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,330
Go ahead.

913
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:19,140
Sandy's birthday party.. - It was fun!

914
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:21,020
Your family is so sweet.

915
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:24,420
Your mummy, papa, uncles and aunts..

916
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:27,300
First, I was in love with you. 
Now, I am in love with your family.

917
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,780
So my family..

918
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:32,100
Agreed to get us married?

919
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:33,580
No.

920
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:38,340
They aren't happy 
about this relationship.

921
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:41,420
They said..

922
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:44,340
..we don't make a good couple.

923
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,780
You look elder than me.

924
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:52,260
You are a little.. not little, 
too much on the heavier side?

925
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:59,420
That's why I keep asking 
you to gain some weight.

926
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:00,940
You are so lanky.

927
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,500
Start having a couple 
of bananas every day.

928
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:07,340
And assorted breads with 
loads of butter on them.

929
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:09,060
And please don't cook 
them in olive oil and stuff..

930
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:10,340
Oh please.

931
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,260
I am not lanky, you are fat.

932
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:18,060
My parents don't want 
their daughter-in-law to be..

933
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,820
Before we end up getting more hurt..

934
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:24,980
Let's breakup now.

935
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:27,110
Excuse me ma'am.

936
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,460
Excuse me, 
could you box this pastry up for me?

937
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:44,940
Why did you breakup?

938
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,020
Well.. it just didn't work out.

939
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,660
He was too dumb.

940
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,220
His brains were stuck here.

941
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,700
He used to have 50 boiled eggs in a day.

942
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,980
I wonder where they all went. 
He didn't have a good body.

943
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:00,180
Anyways, what do you teach?

944
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,340
Hindi.

945
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:02,460
Hindi?

946
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:05,700
It must be quite a boring job, 
I mean, being a Hindi lecturer?

947
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:06,780
Boring?

948
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,540
It's boring to be a lecturer?

949
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:10,140
Hindi.

950
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,860
What's wrong with teaching Hindi?

951
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,100
What do you do?

952
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,340
I'm a bridal makeup artist.

953
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,460
But I have taken a break, 
so I am at home these days.

954
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,220
It's boring to stay at home.

955
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,020
It's not boring to be a Hindi lecturer.

956
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:25,860
'He's such a grouch.'

957
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,780
'I don't want to date this baldie.'

958
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:30,380
'This fatso is so crude.'

959
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,540
'I wouldn't marry her even if 
she is the last girl left in the world.'

960
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:37,780
'How do I say no to him?'

961
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,500
'How do I get out of here?'

962
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,100
We can be friends.

963
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:43,980
Yes!

964
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:45,420
Right! 
Good friends.

965
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:46,580
Great friends.

966
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:47,980
I'll call you.

967
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:49,220
I'll drop in a message on Facebook.

968
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,060
Okay.

969
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:52,660
- Bye. 
- Bye.

970
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:05,780
Auto.

971
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:07,800
- Mayur Vihar? 
- No.

972
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:32,940
Can I drop you somewhere?

973
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,940
Could you drop me to the Metro Station?

974
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:38,220
Fine.

975
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:45,540
Hold on.

976
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:57,740
- Ready? 
- Yes.

977
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:23,420
- She is badly hurt. 
- Bed six, bed six.

978
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,900
- Where is he? - There. 
- Chaman.

979
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,700
Oh my God, what happened?

980
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,020
Are you alright?

981
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,140
- I've just sprained my wrist a little. 
- Your pants are torn.

982
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:31,780
Everything else is fine?

983
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:32,620
Yes.

984
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:33,620
Hello.

985
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,780
I'm Apsara's dad.

986
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,140
Apsara's mom.

987
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:42,660
They were together 
when they had an accident.

988
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:43,940
Meaning?

989
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,300
They were together.

990
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:46,940
Oh.

991
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,140
- Hello. 
- Hello.

992
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,380
I'm his mother.

993
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:52,700
His father.

994
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,660
- Hello, sister. 
- Hello.

995
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,700
- Hello, auntie. Hello, uncle. 
- Hello dear.

996
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,500
Oh no.

997
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,460
This looks bad.

998
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:04,380
No, it's just ligament tear.

999
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,020
How did this happen?

1000
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:09,260
Well, he lost the balance of the scooter.

1001
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,660
Chaman never drives it well.

1002
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:14,380
He almost made me fall a couple of times.

1003
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,380
- I drive carefully. 
- Shut up.

1004
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,620
'Take a good look at her.'

1005
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:21,060
'What makes you think 
she can ride pillion?'

1006
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,700
It's your fault.

1007
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:25,380
I've told you a thousand 
times to let Chaman take the car.

1008
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:28,700
He has a social life. 
He'll make good use of the car.

1009
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:35,060
So, when are they getting discharged?

1010
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:37,380
He's getting discharged today.

1011
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:40,260
They will keep Apsara 
under observation for a day.

1012
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:42,940
Wait.

1013
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:45,780
- Chaman will stay here with her. 
- Yes.

1014
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:46,540
What?

1015
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,420
No sister, I'm here for her.

1016
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,380
No, sister. 
He is the one who caused this.

1017
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,940
- So, he's the one who will 
look after her. - Yes.

1018
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:56,620
- No, I mean we cannot 
give him the trouble. - Yes.

1019
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,180
- No. 
- No, it's no trouble.

1020
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,780
It's better to have a man 
to do the running around if required.

1021
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:01,980
- Yes. - You'll stay. 
Do you understand?

1022
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,660
Sir, please clear the bill.

1023
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:05,540
- Okay. 
- Let's go.

1024
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,020
- Should I come along? 
- Yes.

1025
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:07,980
I'll be right back.

1026
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,460
- Let's go, sister. 
- Come on.

1027
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:14,140
Thank God are kids are fine.

1028
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:15,020
Yes, sister.

1029
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,260
And look at how God 
conspired to get us together.

1030
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:18,140
- I swear. 
- Yes.

1031
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:20,420
Kids these days don't 
tell their parents anything.

1032
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,060
- Chaman had given us a hint. 
- Okay.

1033
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:23,660
- But he didn't give 
us any details. - Okay.

1034
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:24,780
- He is shy that way. 
- I see.

1035
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:29,220
- No.. 
- No need, Mr. Kohli.

1036
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:31,220
Don't embarrass me like this.

1037
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:32,820
- No way. I have change. 
- Same here.

1038
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,940
During the phase of demonetisation, 
you need..

1039
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,580
- No, please. 
- You can ask Ms. Shweta here.

1040
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:38,220
- We are frequent this place. 
- Please let me clear the bill.

1041
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:38,860
We are regulars here.

1042
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,340
Please let me clear the bill.

1043
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:42,140
- I'm begging you. 
- Please don't do that.

1044
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:44,620
That's so unfair. Please don't do this.

1045
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,340
Chaman caused that fall 
so he should pay the bill.

1046
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,780
Let's spilt the bill then.

1047
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,220
Let me contribute a little. Here.

1048
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,460
- Here. 
- Here you go.

1049
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:55,140
We are done. 
What are you doing?

1050
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:55,980
Take this back.

1051
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,380
Thank God that your daughter is healthy.

1052
01:00:58,460 --> 01:00:59,940
You know I too fell over once.

1053
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:04,180
Doctor said my bones didn't 
break because of my body fat.

1054
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:07,620
Well, Apsara has a slow metabolism.

1055
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:08,780
Slow what?

1056
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:13,460
The way her bodies processes 
the food she eats is a little off.

1057
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:15,900
- Okay. 
- She eats less than us.

1058
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:18,060
Tell me, who eats just 
two Parathas (stuffed bread)?

1059
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:19,100
No one.

1060
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:22,060
That's my weak spot as well.

1061
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:22,780
Really?

1062
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:24,420
I faced the same problem 
just day before yesterday.

1063
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,820
I made four Parathas.

1064
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:26,860
Cauliflower is in season these days.

1065
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:28,620
So I thought why not eat them. 
They taste so good.

1066
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:32,140
Chaman's father just 
wouldn't stop taunting me.

1067
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:34,340
I ended up having just three of them.

1068
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:35,260
I don't eat much, you see.

1069
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:36,100
- Really? 
- True.

1070
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:41,780
Mummy?

1071
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:46,300
Mummy?

1072
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:48,380
Mummy?

1073
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:57,060
What happened?

1074
01:01:59,020 --> 01:01:59,940
Where's my mom?

1075
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,340
She's asleep.

1076
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:02,620
Do you want anything?

1077
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,180
Well, actually..

1078
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:22,220
Chaman.

1079
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:23,860
I'm hungry.

1080
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:25,340
I'll go get something.

1081
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:26,980
Can I come with you?

1082
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:28,540
I'm bored.

1083
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:30,660
Doesn't your leg hurt?

1084
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:31,940
Please.

1085
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:37,540
I know this is stupid, 
but I am having a lot of fun.

1086
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:39,880
Of course, I am doing all the hard work.

1087
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:41,970
You are doing exercise.

1088
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:46,300
Why are you so happy?

1089
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:48,900
Five year ago, 
in the last year of graduation..

1090
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:51,340
..I had sneaked out just 
like this to have noodles.

1091
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:55,260
It was the last exam so all my friends 
had come to the hostel for group study.

1092
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:57,260
The only difference was 
that we had booze instead of this.

1093
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:59,260
A night before the exam?

1094
01:02:59,340 --> 01:02:59,900
Yes.

1095
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:02,700
It was the last day of college. 
That's the least we could do.

1096
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,500
Actually, 
this is my first hospitalisation.

1097
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:08,220
Have you ever been hospitalised?

1098
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:08,780
No.

1099
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:10,420
New experience.

1100
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,740
New experience?

1101
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:13,300
Be grateful, it wasn't anything serious.

1102
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,980
There is always a reason 
behind everything in life.

1103
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:20,060
There is always something good in it, 
we just don't see it.

1104
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:21,660
What can be good in an accident?

1105
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:23,060
We will learn that later.

1106
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,460
Like if not for the accident..

1107
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:28,140
..we wouldn't be having noodles 
and tea in the middle of the night.

1108
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:29,100
Talking like this.

1109
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,580
We wouldn't have experienced 
the wheelchair ride.

1110
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:32,820
True.

1111
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:35,180
Tell me something.

1112
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:36,820
Why an arranged marriage?

1113
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,940
You don't have a girlfriend?

1114
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:41,580
You have never been in a relationship?

1115
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:43,700
I was.

1116
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:45,740
I have been in many relationships.

1117
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:47,580
In school, in college.

1118
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:49,540
Even until recently.

1119
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:51,540
I just had a breakup.

1120
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:53,700
And why did it happen?

1121
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,140
She was a 20-year-old kid.

1122
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:56,980
Immature.

1123
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:58,740
She had no brains.

1124
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:00,740
She was a headache.

1125
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,620
And.. 
You don't compromise.

1126
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:04,660
I know.

1127
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,780
Anyway, look for someone 
close to your age to get married.

1128
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:10,940
Yes.

1129
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:13,900
And you won't find such girls on Tinder.

1130
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:16,460
You'll have to opt for 
a marriage bureau or shaadi.com.

1131
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:17,700
So please go there.

1132
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:20,260
I know where and how to find a girl.

1133
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,940
You don't need to tell me.

1134
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:24,300
Don't get upset, I was just joking.

1135
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:24,980
Chill.

1136
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:30,060
Shall we leave?

1137
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:33,260
Let's go.

1138
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:47,180
By the way, thank you.

1139
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:49,660
Thank you for the tea, 
noodles and..

1140
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:51,660
The wheelchair ride.

1141
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:53,260
Good night.

1142
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:54,220
Good night.

1143
01:04:58,220 --> 01:04:59,660
I feel cheated, Raj.

1144
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,140
Everything's fake on the internet.

1145
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:03,380
What you see is not what you get.

1146
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:06,060
I gave her a lift and 
we met with an accident.

1147
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,580
Our parents ended up meeting each other.

1148
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:10,460
They were talking to each other 
like they were long lost relatives.

1149
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:13,380
I spent the whole night 
in the hospital for no reason.

1150
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,260
You spent the night in the hospital?

1151
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:16,860
- Yes. 
- Then what happened?

1152
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:19,140
Then what? 
Dawn came and I escaped.

1153
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:21,500
I'll talk to you later.

1154
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:23,220
- I'm getting late for my class. 
- Okay, sir.

1155
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:29,540
This is how it is supposed to be. 
Kids should do whatever they please.

1156
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:30,140
Right.

1157
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:32,980
Chaman is a very decent 
and a well-cultured boy.

1158
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:33,420
Okay.

1159
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:36,700
He doesn't have girlfriends. 
He doesn't like to loiter around.

1160
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:39,060
He's a very ""pure"".

1161
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:42,100
Very pure. 
Just like Ghee (Clarified butter).

1162
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:42,740
Yes.

1163
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:43,820
There he is.

1164
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,020
Come here, son.

1165
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:46,220
- Hello. 
- Hello.

1166
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,340
We were just talking about you.

1167
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:49,780
- Yes. 
- Come and sit with us.

1168
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:50,380
No, I am fine.

1169
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:51,700
It's not fine. Come here.

1170
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,820
Come on, come and sit with us.

1171
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,100
How are you doing, son?

1172
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:59,460
How are you feeling now?

1173
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:00,580
Good.

1174
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:01,460
Thank God.

1175
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,780
- Mr. Kohli? 
- Yes.

1176
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:07,180
- He looks ""pure"". 
- Right.

1177
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:08,140
Absolutely.

1178
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:12,300
It's so hard to find 
such ""pure"" boys these days.

1179
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:14,420
Boys are such creeps these days.

1180
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,460
My son has always respected girls.

1181
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:17,620
That's why he is ""pure"".

1182
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:20,820
- He doesn't drink or smoke either. 
- Right.

1183
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:24,380
We have no issues with that.

1184
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,540
- Really? 
- We too sometimes..

1185
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:28,540
Really?

1186
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:30,540
Mr. Batra, why didn't you tell me? 
I would have got some for you.

1187
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:32,540
- What would you have? 
- No, thanks.

1188
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:34,700
It will be here in no time. 
It won't be a problem.

1189
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:36,300
We'll share a drink or two. 
What do you say?

1190
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:38,860
Come on, don't force him.

1191
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:40,260
He must not be in mood for it.

1192
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:42,300
Some other time then. 
We'll be getting together often now.

1193
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:43,140
Right.

1194
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,220
Okay then, we'll take your leave now.

1195
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:49,500
- How about another round of tea? 
- No, thank you.

1196
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:51,260
- Bye. 
- Bye.

1197
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:53,700
That's okay.

1198
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:57,980
""Pure"" boy.

1199
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:02,380
It is not so, papa.

1200
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:04,020
We are just friends.

1201
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:05,740
That's good, dear.

1202
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:07,620
Friends make good husbands.

1203
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,700
Look at our friendship for example.

1204
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:10,420
Right?

1205
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:11,820
- Here. 
- Cheers.

1206
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:16,380
I agree he doesn't have 
much hair but he is a nice boy.

1207
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:17,780
It's not that, mummy.

1208
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:21,100
I know he is a Hindi professor. 
It's a little boring.

1209
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:23,100
But it is a government job.

1210
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:25,140
And she knows how to 
keep herself entertained.

1211
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:27,300
The important thing 
is that he is a nice boy.

1212
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:28,140
Yes.

1213
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:29,780
It is not so.

1214
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:35,260
The thing is, 
he isn't a loafer like the other boys.

1215
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:36,580
He is a decent boy.

1216
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:38,620
A ""pure"" guy.

1217
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:39,820
A ""pure"" boy.

1218
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:44,020
One look at him and 
I knew that he is ""pure"".

1219
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:47,020
Tell me something, 
how did all this started?

1220
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:50,020
We were just having a conversation 
and they brought up the marriage topic.

1221
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:57,060
Apsara, you are 29 years old.

1222
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:58,900
How much longer do you want to wait?

1223
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:01,900
Look, dear..

1224
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:03,300
Only if you feel like it..

1225
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:04,660
If you like him..

1226
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:05,660
If you think he is genuine..

1227
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:08,620
Then we will go forward.

1228
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:09,980
Right?

1229
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:12,340
Chaman likes me?

1230
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:13,300
- Yes! 
- Yes!

1231
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:16,100
That's why his parents 
brought up the marriage topic.

1232
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,500
Who brought up this topic? 
I don't want to get married.

1233
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:21,940
Open the door! I said open it!

1234
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:23,580
Strange.

1235
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:26,940
Not so long ago he said 
he found a girl and what not.

1236
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:29,060
I just don't understand.

1237
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:31,260
She is so fat.

1238
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:32,220
She won't look good with me.

1239
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:34,700
She isn't fat. 
Her metal-ball..

1240
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:37,700
Something is off balanced.

1241
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:40,820
He will go around with fat 
girls but we won't marry them!

1242
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:42,700
She isn't fat, she is healthy.

1243
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:43,500
- Like you. 
- Right.

1244
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:44,980
That's how Punjabi girls are.

1245
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:46,820
She is not like those matchstick 
thin South Delhi girls..

1246
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:49,420
..who get drunk on empty 
stomach and then puck their guts out.

1247
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,780
Have you taken a good look at her?

1248
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:52,140
Have you seen yourself?

1249
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:53,660
You think you are Tom Cruise?

1250
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:54,900
This isn't my fault.

1251
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:56,180
It's grandpa's fault.

1252
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:59,100
The one you worship every morning. 
He is behind this.

1253
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:01,020
I inherited baldness from him.

1254
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:02,300
How did you get it from him?

1255
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:03,580
How?

1256
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:05,340
It's because of the genes, mummy.

1257
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:06,260
You won't understand.

1258
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:10,820
And why don't I have this hair.. 
heredity?

1259
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:11,380
Right.

1260
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:12,540
- Why doesn't Goldie have it? 
- Right.

1261
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:13,580
You guys are lucky.

1262
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:15,860
These genes went dormant 
for you and Goldie.

1263
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:17,020
That's why they didn't 
have any effect on you two.

1264
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:18,500
I had to suffer all its ill effects.

1265
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:21,540
Oh great! It's not like 
I forced these genes on you.

1266
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:22,620
Strange fellow.

1267
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,380
God decides what you 
get and what you don't get.

1268
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:28,620
What should I do? 
I have no feelings for her.

1269
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:29,980
Listen son..

1270
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:32,820
There is a right time for everything.

1271
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:35,140
You will start getting these 
feelings after you get married.

1272
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:36,340
Get this straight!

1273
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:39,700
You are not in a position to 
choose a girl based on your feelings!

1274
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:41,860
Try to understand. 
You'll be single all your life otherwise.

1275
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:44,780
You'll be banging your head 
on walls in a couple of years.

1276
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:46,860
You will die a virgin! 
A virgin!

1277
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:47,700
Die what?

1278
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:49,460
Forget it.

1279
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:53,220
One more thing, 
all these praises are a lie.

1280
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:56,380
30-year-old guy, and ""pure""?

1281
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:59,140
This is not something to boast about.

1282
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:00,260
It is!

1283
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:01,580
My son is ""pure"". Chaste!

1284
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:03,980
I am not ""pure"". 
You can have it checked.

1285
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:04,700
Right!

1286
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:07,300
I am your father. I know everything.

1287
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:11,700
Please don't put so 
much pressurise on my head.

1288
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:14,700
You are under pressure 
because of your head, son.

1289
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:16,140
Why don't you get it?

1290
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:19,100
We have been getting 
humiliated since five years.

1291
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:21,780
So many families have rejected you.

1292
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:23,740
We cannot take this anymore.

1293
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:24,940
We are tired.

1294
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:28,860
Guddi, talk to him.

1295
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:36,580
Look son, 
you will turn 31 in four months.

1296
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:40,300
Think about it.

1297
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:45,500
I know my son will 
make the right decision.

1298
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:04,670
[I think we can be good friends]

1299
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:06,770
[But we aren't compatible for marriage]

1300
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:17,900
[Can we meet tomorrow evening? 
I need to talk to you]

1301
01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:21,530
[No]

1302
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,290
[Okay]

1303
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:40,900
We can be good friends.

1304
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,140
We aren't compatible for marriage.

1305
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:44,700
We can be good friends.

1306
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:45,580
Hi.

1307
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:47,180
Hi.

1308
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:48,980
How are you?

1309
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:49,860
Good.

1310
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:52,420
How's your hand?

1311
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:55,500
How's your leg?

1312
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:57,740
It's almost healed.

1313
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:59,950
They'll take off the 
bandage in a couple of days.

1314
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,580
- Well.. 
- Chaman, I wanted to say something.

1315
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:11,620
My ex-boyfriend Mohit..

1316
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:16,920
Actually, he dumped me and 
it wasn't the other way around.

1317
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:21,100
He kept using the 
excuse of compatibility.

1318
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,740
But he finally said the 
truth while breaking up with me.

1319
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:30,300
He and his family had a 
problem with me being overweight.

1320
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:38,380
They said he is their only son 
so they wanted an angelic wife for him.

1321
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:44,620
I did the same thing with 
you during our first meeting.

1322
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:47,260
I judged you for your looks.

1323
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,420
So, you are rejecting me?

1324
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:50,780
No.

1325
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:54,500
That accident was destiny.

1326
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:59,620
If not for that, 
we wouldn't have met again.

1327
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:01,700
Our families wouldn't have met.

1328
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:05,740
And I wouldn't have been 
able to see your inner beauty.

1329
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:07,220
'Inner beauty?'

1330
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:13,180
And perhaps, you and your family 
wouldn't be able to see my inner beauty.

1331
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:14,580
'What inner beauty?'

1332
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:19,460
Chaman, somewhere.. somewhere I like you.

1333
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:24,500
I think if our families get along..

1334
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:27,020
..so well then we too 
can consider getting married.

1335
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:32,830
Do you have something to say?

1336
01:13:34,970 --> 01:13:35,840
No.

1337
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:40,260
Looks are superficial, Chaman.

1338
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:42,300
Everyone loses hair eventually.

1339
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,900
Everyone puts on some 
weight after marriage.

1340
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:47,740
If it has to happen eventually 
then why not accept it?

1341
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:52,260
You are very nice.

1342
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:55,620
Everyone on Tinder is only 
looking for a one-night stand.

1343
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:59,940
But you can meet on 
Tinder and fall in love.

1344
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,020
You can get married too.

1345
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:08,460
Well, I have deleted 
the app from my phone.

1346
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:09,540
You too should delete it.

1347
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:16,310
Why don't you just say no to her?

1348
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:19,030
I am not in a position to refuse, Raj.

1349
01:14:19,950 --> 01:14:21,870
My family is tired. 
And what reason would I give them?

1350
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:24,390
I have no other option.

1351
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:26,910
If not for that accident, 
all this wouldn't have happened.

1352
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:30,190
Why don't you talk to the girl? 
Perhaps, she'd agree with you.

1353
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:31,750
I'd gone to talk to her.

1354
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:33,790
She told me the sob 
story about her breakup.

1355
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:36,230
What would have I told her anyway?

1356
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:38,590
That she is fat.. and 
that's why I cannot marry her?

1357
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,910
They are about to match our horoscopes.

1358
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,030
That's how serious things are now.

1359
01:14:52,790 --> 01:14:53,630
What?

1360
01:14:56,790 --> 01:14:57,510
Huh?

1361
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:06,030
Guruji, my parents want 
me to marry a girl I don't like.

1362
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,870
They will come here tomorrow 
to match our horoscopes.

1363
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,750
If you could find 
compatibly issues then..

1364
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:18,990
Then?

1365
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:22,510
I can pay you 5000.

1366
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:31,310
You think these horoscopes..

1367
01:15:32,370 --> 01:15:35,470
planetary positions, astrology..

1368
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:38,510
..are a joke, right?

1369
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:41,510
Do you?

1370
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:42,070
No.

1371
01:15:42,150 --> 01:15:44,550
Then what are you asking me to do?

1372
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:50,350
I should change the planetary positions 
just because you're paying me 5000?

1373
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:51,630
Huh?

1374
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:54,230
Are you asking me to lie? 
Do you have any faith in them?

1375
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:57,070
Do you have any respect for them? 
Do you believe in them?

1376
01:15:57,150 --> 01:15:58,710
- Do you trust them? 
- I do.

1377
01:15:58,790 --> 01:16:00,770
You are lying. 
You are a liar.

1378
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:02,390
You want me to lie for money.

1379
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:04,230
- Get out of here. 
- No.

1380
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:06,310
- Please. 
- I said leave! Get out!

1381
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:10,710
Nonsense.

1382
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,710
Why are you still here?

1383
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:18,870
Why are you crying?

1384
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:21,710
Everything's in your hands now.

1385
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:24,070
Look, nothing's in my hands. 
Stop crying.

1386
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:27,190
What.. what are you doing? 
Please don't cry.

1387
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:28,750
What is the problem?

1388
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:32,310
Neither she nor will 
I be happy after marriage.

1389
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:32,950
Okay.

1390
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:34,750
You are about to ruin two lives.

1391
01:16:34,830 --> 01:16:36,550
Hey! How am I ruining them?

1392
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:39,710
Look son, don't behave like your mother.

1393
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:42,390
Please don't cry and listen to me.

1394
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:44,230
Okay.

1395
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:46,630
Okay tell me what I need to do.

1396
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:50,390
You just need to find 
incompatibility issues.

1397
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:51,950
I don't want to get married to her.

1398
01:16:53,270 --> 01:16:53,990
Fine.

1399
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:59,390
Anyway, what's the use of a marriage 
that won't make you or that girl happy?

1400
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:01,230
Fine, I'll do it.

1401
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:03,590
But get this straight.

1402
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:06,150
I'll have to say there 
are issues in your horoscope.

1403
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:07,670
I won't do this to her.

1404
01:17:08,230 --> 01:17:09,550
She is someone's daughter.

1405
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:11,310
How can I do that?

1406
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:12,430
I won't be able to do that.

1407
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:13,350
Okay, guruji.

1408
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:15,430
You can say there are 
issues in my horoscope.

1409
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:16,310
Okay.

1410
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:20,630
But make sure to create a 
doubt in her mind which scares her.

1411
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:22,710
Okay. 
Consider it done.

1412
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:25,070
- Thank you, guruji. 
- It's okay.

1413
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:26,830
Hey, listen..

1414
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:30,910
The..

1415
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:33,830
5000?

1416
01:17:34,270 --> 01:17:35,030
Tomorrow?

1417
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:36,990
Today.

1418
01:17:37,470 --> 01:17:37,990
Okay.

1419
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,470
I mean right now.

1420
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:42,950
- Right now? 
- Yes.

1421
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:51,430
Can I pay less?

1422
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:55,950
Can I create less doubt?

1423
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:56,830
No.

1424
01:17:57,450 --> 01:17:58,670
No. Good.

1425
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:02,110
Fuel?

1426
01:18:12,350 --> 01:18:14,310
- Thank you, guruji. 
- It's okay.

1427
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:31,550
Well, there is an issue 
in the boy's planetary positions.

1428
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:33,110
Shit.

1429
01:18:36,990 --> 01:18:39,070
Guruji, is it serious?

1430
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:41,110
Yes. No.

1431
01:18:42,010 --> 01:18:42,830
I mean..

1432
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:45,070
..it is very serious.

1433
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:49,590
All the planets are in wrong place.

1434
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:52,670
Ma'am, let me put this in this way.

1435
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:54,150
If he gets married to her..

1436
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:56,870
..a life will be in danger

1437
01:18:57,670 --> 01:18:58,950
Not your life.

1438
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,510
Her life will be in danger.

1439
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:03,990
So Mr. Kohli, I suggest you let her go.

1440
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:06,830
How can we let her go? 
She is like a daughter to us.

1441
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:09,590
That's why I am saying so. 
You should let her go.

1442
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:12,080
Guruji, there has to be a solution.

1443
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,150
There are chances that she could die.

1444
01:19:14,230 --> 01:19:18,590
Guruji, life and death 
are anyway not in our hands.

1445
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:22,880
Even a few days with 
Chaman would be enough for me.

1446
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:30,030
Chaman, mummy, 
papa, they all love me a lot.

1447
01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:33,070
They perhaps love me more than I deserve.

1448
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:34,630
Wow.

1449
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:36,830
- Saw that? 
- I did.

1450
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:38,310
Can I get a better 
daughter-in-law than her?

1451
01:19:38,510 --> 01:19:39,630
She is very..

1452
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:42,350
She is a goddess.

1453
01:19:42,630 --> 01:19:44,070
Don't cry, mummy. Calm down.

1454
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:45,710
- Calm down, Guddi. 
- Shut up.

1455
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:48,470
Look.. Guruji, you are so knowledgeable.

1456
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:50,190
- That's fine. 
- We are nothing compared to you.

1457
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:52,670
Look knowledge and death are not related.

1458
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:54,590
No, I am sure you 
have a solution for this.

1459
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:56,230
- No, this.. 
- Don't cry.

1460
01:19:56,430 --> 01:19:57,710
We will do whatever you ask us to do.

1461
01:19:57,790 --> 01:19:59,510
Any kind of a benediction 
or a prayer you want.

1462
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:02,030
- Yoga, medication, I'm willing to 
do everything. - There is a solution.

1463
01:20:02,190 --> 01:20:03,590
There is a solution.

1464
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:04,390
Please tell us.

1465
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:08,310
But you said that all 
the planets are doomed!

1466
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:09,720
Yes, they are doomed.

1467
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,590
But they can revived by 
performing a certain benediction.

1468
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:17,270
So, you have to perform a benediction 
which will cost you 21,500.

1469
01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:20,230
21,500, guruji?

1470
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:22,710
Do you have a problem with that?

1471
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:24,390
- No. 
- Then do it.

1472
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:27,390
21,500, guruji? 
Can we not bring this down a little?

1473
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:28,910
Just a little, if you could?

1474
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:30,950
What are you doing, Mr. Kohli?

1475
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:34,390
We are trying to get your son 
married and you are bargaining with me?

1476
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:36,870
No bargaining, 
we want him to get married.

1477
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:37,990
Good.

1478
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:39,590
Seek his blessings, dear.

1479
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:41,030
- You are our saviour, guruji. 
- It's okay.

1480
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:42,870
You have saved us.

1481
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:44,270
Hail to thee!

1482
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:45,670
Seek his blessings.

1483
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:46,630
Come on, son.

1484
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:48,390
Bless you.

1485
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:50,370
Mr. Kohli..

1486
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:15,750
What's wrong?

1487
01:21:16,230 --> 01:21:17,510
What are you doing here?

1488
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:19,550
It was quite smoky outside.

1489
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:23,230
Everyone was clicking pictures outside.

1490
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:25,430
We don't click a single picture together.

1491
01:21:30,430 --> 01:21:31,390
Come closer.

1492
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:35,430
Smile.

1493
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,190
Chaman sir?

1494
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:53,070
I was wondering..

1495
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:54,750
.. how about some coffee?

1496
01:21:56,590 --> 01:21:58,110
I'll ask the canteen guy to get it.

1497
01:21:58,300 --> 01:21:59,030
No.

1498
01:21:59,230 --> 01:22:03,350
I meant could we go out in the evening?

1499
01:22:04,270 --> 01:22:06,030
Actually, why go out for just coffee?

1500
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:09,190
How about a movie followed by dinner?

1501
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,790
Why? Don't you have 
plans with your boyfriend?

1502
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:18,230
I just had a breakup.

1503
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:22,790
He was cheating on me.. 
with a girl from his office.

1504
01:22:24,070 --> 01:22:25,070
Chaman sir..

1505
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:31,190
I have learnt that these handsome, 
good-looking boys are playboys.

1506
01:22:32,170 --> 01:22:37,150
One should get married to a sorted, 
sensible, mature man.

1507
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:39,150
Someone like you.

1508
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:43,310
You look loyal and committed.

1509
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:47,310
Ekta ma'am, congratulate him.

1510
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:48,590
Why?

1511
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:50,230
Did he get an increment?

1512
01:22:50,310 --> 01:22:52,190
He stealthily got betrothed.

1513
01:22:52,670 --> 01:22:53,830
He didn't even inform anyone.

1514
01:22:56,940 --> 01:23:00,190
His would-be wife posted a 
picture on Facebook and tagged him.

1515
01:23:00,370 --> 01:23:01,350
That's how I found out.

1516
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:02,630
Otherwise..

1517
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:07,950
Chaman sir looks like a 
decent man but he is very cunning..

1518
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:14,590
A perfect couple.

1519
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:17,140
A match made in heaven, huh.

1520
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:04,950
[Please delete the 
picture posted on Facebook]

1521
01:24:06,150 --> 01:24:08,390
No one should be as unfortunate as I am.

1522
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:11,550
When I was single, 
no one would entertain me.

1523
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:13,830
Suddenly everyone is interested 
in me after that fatso entered my life.

1524
01:24:13,970 --> 01:24:15,510
But sir, think about this.

1525
01:24:15,670 --> 01:24:19,510
She is ready to marry you 
without worrying about her life.

1526
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:21,470
She is without a doubt a good girl.

1527
01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:23,350
She might be a good girl 
but that doesn't work for me.

1528
01:24:25,030 --> 01:24:26,910
She has announced it to the world..

1529
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:28,310
..by posting the picture on Facebook.

1530
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:31,310
Sir, why do you have 
a problem with her being fat?

1531
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:33,670
I have a problem because of this.

1532
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:40,230
The students..

1533
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:43,350
First, they used to tease 
me by calling me baldie.

1534
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:45,230
Now they say I'm marrying a buffalo.

1535
01:24:47,130 --> 01:24:48,430
What do I do, Raj?

1536
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:50,510
I know I am not that handsome.

1537
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:54,630
But I always dreamed 
of having a beautiful wife.

1538
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,070
Someone I can love.

1539
01:24:57,390 --> 01:24:59,330
Look at yourself. 
You have been married for seven years.

1540
01:25:00,650 --> 01:25:02,150
There is so much excitement and love.

1541
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:04,150
You are always talking to her on phone.

1542
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:05,370
Why?

1543
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:08,270
Because you two are a perfect couple.

1544
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:10,910
Yes, sir.

1545
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:14,470
Who is it?

1546
01:25:15,130 --> 01:25:16,230
My wife.

1547
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:17,830
Yes, Shanti.

1548
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:21,230
Sorry, I couldn't call, I was with sir.

1549
01:25:21,310 --> 01:25:22,470
Excuse me, sir.

1550
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:24,270
Yes, yes.

1551
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:25,630
Okay.

1552
01:25:37,390 --> 01:25:38,150
Hello?

1553
01:25:38,230 --> 01:25:39,190
Sorry.

1554
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:42,150
I was applying makeup to a bride. 
My phone was on silent.

1555
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:44,230
I just got free. 
So..

1556
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:47,430
Why did you ask me to delete the photo?

1557
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:49,310
Did you read the comments?

1558
01:25:49,580 --> 01:25:51,110
Yes, I did. 
So?

1559
01:25:51,790 --> 01:25:53,150
Everyone's making fun of us.

1560
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:54,150
Please delete it.

1561
01:25:54,910 --> 01:25:56,190
Everyone's making fun..?

1562
01:25:56,630 --> 01:25:58,110
Who are making these comments?

1563
01:25:58,190 --> 01:25:59,430
University students.

1564
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:01,150
Do you know all of them?

1565
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:02,500
No.

1566
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:03,190
Then?

1567
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:06,510
Some random people's 
comments shouldn't affect us.

1568
01:26:06,690 --> 01:26:08,350
Apsara, they are insulting me.

1569
01:26:09,050 --> 01:26:10,110
Who is insulting..?

1570
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:14,870
Who is insulting you, Chaman?

1571
01:26:15,310 --> 01:26:17,390
People will always have something to say.

1572
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:19,790
Some of it will be good 
and most of it will be bad.

1573
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:21,870
So, should we always react?

1574
01:26:23,390 --> 01:26:27,150
How does it affect our lives..

1575
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:32,150
..if some random people 
pass a comment on us?

1576
01:26:32,910 --> 01:26:35,150
I am only asking you to delete a photo.

1577
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:40,070
This isn't just about the photo, Chaman.

1578
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:44,430
What if someone tell 
you something bad about me?

1579
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:46,630
Will you leave me as well?

1580
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:51,510
Apsara, you don't get it.

1581
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:53,230
I teach in this college.

1582
01:26:53,310 --> 01:26:54,790
I have to come here every day.

1583
01:26:56,590 --> 01:26:58,990
Fine, I'll delete it.

1584
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:03,750
But please Chaman, 
start ignoring these things.

1585
01:27:03,950 --> 01:27:07,030
We cannot react like 
this over every little thing.

1586
01:27:12,370 --> 01:27:13,430
Bye.

1587
01:27:13,990 --> 01:27:14,700
Bye.

1588
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:26,510
Hi, sister!

1589
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:28,790
- Hello. 
- Hi.

1590
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:31,110
- How are you? 
- Busy shopping for the wedding, huh?

1591
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:34,870
- Sushma's son is getting married? 
- Come on!

1592
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:36,390
She doesn't know.

1593
01:27:37,110 --> 01:27:38,910
Let me show you her picture on Facebook.

1594
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:40,990
- She is nice. 
- Yes.

1595
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:42,790
But don't you think she 
is a little on the heavier side?

1596
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:45,550
- I thought so too. 
- Same here.

1597
01:27:46,110 --> 01:27:47,510
She looks elder than Chaman.

1598
01:27:47,590 --> 01:27:48,590
No, sister.

1599
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:51,470
She isn't fat, she is healthy.

1600
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:54,110
She isn't like the other girls 
who are as thin as a matchstick.

1601
01:27:54,190 --> 01:27:56,390
You know it later causes 
complications during pregnancy.

1602
01:27:56,670 --> 01:27:57,950
What's the use of having such a body?

1603
01:27:58,030 --> 01:28:00,430
You should have a body 
strong enough to bear a child.

1604
01:28:00,510 --> 01:28:01,470
That is true.

1605
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:04,310
- You continue with your shopping then. 
- Okay.

1606
01:28:04,390 --> 01:28:06,350
You have to come for the wedding. 
I'll call you.

1607
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:07,590
- Bye. 
- Bye.

1608
01:28:21,310 --> 01:28:25,160
[You are nice, 
but we aren't right for each other]

1609
01:28:26,650 --> 01:28:28,720
[So, let's not get married]

1610
01:28:44,210 --> 01:28:45,010
Hello?

1611
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:45,970
Yes?

1612
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:47,210
We are leaving.

1613
01:28:47,290 --> 01:28:49,570
- Hurry up, Goldie. Put these 
things in the car. - Okay.

1614
01:28:49,650 --> 01:28:51,810
No, you don't need to go. 
Take a left from Hanuman Temple.

1615
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:53,330
Hello, how are you?

1616
01:28:53,410 --> 01:28:54,650
You are looking dashing, Mr. Kohli.

1617
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:56,410
- I just got it stitched. 
- Good.

1618
01:28:56,490 --> 01:28:57,450
How are the preparations going on?

1619
01:28:57,530 --> 01:28:59,530
- Good. They are going on well. 
- Let's go.

1620
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:04,090
Chaman, Apsara will be 
officially yours from today.

1621
01:29:04,170 --> 01:29:05,210
Very good.

1622
01:29:05,290 --> 01:29:06,490
- Come on. 
- Let's go.

1623
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:08,810
Hurry up. Why are you just sitting there? 
We are getting late.

1624
01:29:33,690 --> 01:29:39,190
[I've been wanting to say something... 
I am not happy with this match]

1625
01:29:41,590 --> 01:29:43,150
[Please don't ask me why]

1626
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,770
- Where have you reached? 
- Stop that and take these boxes.

1627
01:29:58,850 --> 01:30:00,160
- Okay. 
- Hurry up.

1628
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:01,530
- Take them quickly. 
- Pass them on.

1629
01:30:01,610 --> 01:30:04,410
- Hurry up, Mr. Kohli. 
- Hurry up, everyone.

1630
01:30:04,490 --> 01:30:05,630
What hurry up?

1631
01:30:05,710 --> 01:30:07,330
Aren't we going to take the 
boy who is about to get engaged along?

1632
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:08,730
I'll call him.

1633
01:30:08,810 --> 01:30:10,010
Chaman!

1634
01:30:10,180 --> 01:30:11,010
Chaman!

1635
01:30:11,090 --> 01:30:13,250
- Calm down. Let him get ready. 
- Go and get him.

1636
01:30:13,330 --> 01:30:14,690
- Let him get ready at least. 
- Yes?

1637
01:30:14,770 --> 01:30:16,380
Why did you take a left? 
Let me talk to Minku.

1638
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:18,080
Mr. Batra is calling.

1639
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:19,810
Yes, Mr. Batra.

1640
01:30:20,490 --> 01:30:21,690
Yes, we have left.

1641
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:24,740
What?

1642
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:26,210
You aren't coming?

1643
01:30:27,230 --> 01:30:28,480
What are you saying, Mr. Batra?

1644
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,440
All our relatives and guests are here.

1645
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,080
What? 
No, listen to me.

1646
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:34,760
Did Chaman say something to her?

1647
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:37,340
We'll convince them if they had a fight.

1648
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,600
It is not so? 
Then?

1649
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:42,320
What?

1650
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:45,660
She isn't sure?

1651
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:47,680
Mr. Batra, please listen...

1652
01:30:47,830 --> 01:30:49,280
He disconnected the call. Strange.

1653
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,400
At the last moment, he is saying that..

1654
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:51,320
..they aren't going 
ahead with the engagement.

1655
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:54,840
Apsara refused to get engaged. 
She says she isn't sure about Chaman.

1656
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:55,760
- Apsara isn't sure? 
- Yes.

1657
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,200
You should have pressed him for details.

1658
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:58,560
There was a lot of 
noise in the background.

1659
01:30:58,640 --> 01:30:59,800
He isn't answering the call.

1660
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:01,760
- He disconnected it. 
- Give me the phone for just a second.

1661
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:03,080
- Come on! 
- Let me call Apsara.

1662
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,280
- Let me talk. 
- Keep quiet for a minute.

1663
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:05,280
- He isn't taking my calls. 
- Let me call Apsara.

1664
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:06,280
- Fine, call her. 
- Come on.

1665
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:08,040
Calm down, Sushma.

1666
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,280
Continue doing your work.

1667
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,160
We will be going there. 
We will surely go there.

1668
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:13,880
Apsara's phone is switched off.

1669
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,040
That's what I have been trying to say.

1670
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:16,720
Give it back. 
This is my phone. Let me call them.

1671
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:39,320
Stop it, guys.

1672
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:40,840
I've had enough of 
these courtesy messages.

1673
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:55,160
Chaman.

1674
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:00,400
I can understand what 
you are going through.

1675
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:07,840
You had been waiting since 
five years for this day and...

1676
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:12,920
On the day of the engagement, 
she says that she isn't sure.

1677
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:15,880
This is wrong.

1678
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,480
I didn't expect this from her.

1679
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,360
She didn't think about 
how everyone would feel.

1680
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:26,800
How you'd feel, how we'd feel.

1681
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,000
Who had thought Mr. 
Batra would do such a thing?

1682
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,960
Kids get off the track sometimes.

1683
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:34,000
Mr. Batra should have met us.

1684
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:35,520
We at least deserve much that courtesy.

1685
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:36,880
He isn't even taking our calls.

1686
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:41,840
Son, tell me something, has 
she ever told you that she wasn't sure?

1687
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:45,360
Or did you say something to her?

1688
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:49,760
You sure?

1689
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:52,240
You cannot trust this generation.

1690
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,010
They think something 
and do something else.

1691
01:32:54,090 --> 01:32:55,840
You never know what's on their mind.

1692
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:00,440
Don't feel disheartened, son.

1693
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:02,200
God will set everything right.

1694
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:03,880
Your mother and I, 
we will set everything right.

1695
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:06,200
We are with you, son.

1696
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:08,360
- Don't worry. 
- Let's go.

1697
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:10,160
Let's go.

1698
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:39,720
Hi, sir.

1699
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:41,320
Hi.

1700
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,600
Sorry I heard about your 
engagement being called off.

1701
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:48,840
It's very sad.

1702
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:56,880
But there isn't much we can do.

1703
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:00,480
You know that.

1704
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:02,760
Take my boyfriend for example.

1705
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:04,400
He did the same thing.

1706
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:12,960
Don't be disheartened.

1707
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:14,800
It doesn't suit you.

1708
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:18,800
Get over her.

1709
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:25,920
Let's go out for dinner this weekend.

1710
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:29,000
I'm sure you'll feel better.

1711
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,040
It's time for my class.

1712
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:35,320
I'll get going.

1713
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:36,680
Bye.

1714
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:52,720
Have some more wine.

1715
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:55,360
Cheers.

1716
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:03,680
Happy birthday to you.

1717
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:07,240
Happy birthday dear Apsara.

1718
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,480
Happy birthday to you.

1719
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,480
She's your ex-fiancÃÂ©e, right?

1720
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:20,560
Hmm.

1721
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,360
Hi. 
Sorry to disturb you guys.

1722
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:32,600
Today is my birthday, so...

1723
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:34,320
So sweet.

1724
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:35,720
Happy birthday.

1725
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:37,080
Thank you.

1726
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:40,520
Happy birthday.

1727
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,000
Thank you.

1728
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:46,440
How are you?

1729
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:47,520
I am good.

1730
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:56,160
Anyways, enjoy your dinner.

1731
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:57,320
Bye.

1732
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:03,720
She's a little weird, isn't she?

1733
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:05,680
I mean...

1734
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:08,000
Forget it.

1735
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,640
I'll just make a quick 
trip to the washroom.

1736
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:22,480
Apsara...

1737
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:32,600
I didn't expect you to be so 
cordial to me after all that happened.

1738
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:38,000
I had no reason to be rude to you.

1739
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:40,720
In fact..

1740
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:43,320
I feel bad for you.

1741
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:46,920
Learn to face your problems.

1742
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:55,120
So that you never have to 
take a decision under pressure again.

1743
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:02,080
So that you never have to feel 
embarrassed about yourself again.

1744
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:09,560
Anyways..

1745
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:11,640
..take care.

1746
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,440
Can you come over 
to my place on Saturday?

1747
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:38,600
I'll introduce you to my parents.

1748
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:44,840
Thank you.

1749
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:50,040
I'd suggest that you wear 
your hair patch when you come.

1750
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:51,720
It suits you.

1751
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:52,880
It makes you look young.

1752
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:33,000
""What does the heart seek, my lost soul?""

1753
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:37,720
""What does the heart want, my lost soul?""

1754
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:42,680
""What does the heart seek, my lost soul?""

1755
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:47,920
""What does the heart want, my lost soul?""

1756
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:50,840
""There is no desire 
for being desired anymore""

1757
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:53,520
""Is that a good thing?""

1758
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:58,520
""Why doesn't anything make 
you happy anymore, my lost soul?""

1759
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:01,640
""My lost soul...""

1760
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:04,000
""My lost soul...""

1761
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:08,760
""It is time to stop 
and take stock of life""

1762
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:11,240
""My lost soul...""

1763
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:13,880
""My lost soul...""

1764
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:19,000
""It is time to stop 
and take stock of life""

1765
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:25,600
""Was what you got not enough?""

1766
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:29,240
""What more did you gain by running away?""

1767
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:31,600
""My lost soul...""

1768
01:39:31,950 --> 01:39:34,760
""My lost soul...""

1769
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:39,200
""It is time to stop 
and take stock of life""

1770
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:40,920
Yes, I had my lunch.

1771
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:43,080
Yes Shanti, I ate my lunch.

1772
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,360
I'll call you back.

1773
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:52,880
Sir?

1774
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,040
Yes, Raj?

1775
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:57,400
Tomorrow is my wedding anniversary.

1776
01:39:57,680 --> 01:39:59,400
We don't celebrate.

1777
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:01,640
We'll just have dinner together.

1778
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:02,920
Will you join us, sir?

1779
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:04,560
Yes, I will.

1780
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:05,720
Thank you, sir.

1781
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:07,720
I'll Whatsapp you the address.

1782
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:08,640
Thank you.

1783
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:14,280
""O' wandering traveller...""

1784
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:18,880
""O' lonely bird, please come back""

1785
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:26,560
""My heart already aches, 
please don't hurt me anymore""

1786
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:32,040
""With open windows 
and doors of the heart...""

1787
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:37,080
""I ask you to please come back""

1788
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:39,720
""I love you""

1789
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:42,240
""It's time to make 
yourself a better being""

1790
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:46,110
""Don't push me away, I am your destiny""

1791
01:40:46,190 --> 01:40:48,680
""My lost soul...""

1792
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:51,360
""My lost soul...""

1793
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:56,000
""It is time to stop 
and take stock of life""

1794
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:59,000
""My lost soul...""

1795
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:01,560
""My lost soul...""

1796
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:07,320
""It is time to stop 
and take stock of life""

1797
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:13,000
""Was what you got not enough?""

1798
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:16,680
""What more did you gain by running away?""

1799
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:19,320
""My lost soul...""

1800
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:21,960
""My lost soul...""

1801
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:27,320
""It is time to stop 
and take stock of life""

1802
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:29,560
""My lost soul...""

1803
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:32,000
""My lost soul...""

1804
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:36,720
""It is time to stop 
and take stock of life""

1805
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:12,160
- Please have some more, sir. 
- No thank you, Raj.

1806
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:13,560
Just a little.

1807
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,240
Thank you, sister-in-law.

1808
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,640
It's delicious.

1809
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:19,520
Why are you not eating?

1810
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:22,720
She'll have it later, sir.

1811
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:25,120
Please have it.

1812
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:27,880
She'll eat later, sir.

1813
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:30,920
Are you upset over something?

1814
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:35,760
No, sir. She cannot talk.

1815
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:37,820
What do you mean?

1816
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:40,160
She is mute, sir.

1817
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,800
But those phone calls?

1818
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,440
I do all the talking, sir.

1819
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:48,560
She just listens.

1820
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:52,920
I understand what her silence means.

1821
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:55,160
I know what she will ask.

1822
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:57,440
I take a guess and reply back.

1823
01:42:58,520 --> 01:42:59,640
I love her, sir.

1824
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:01,680
I love her a lot.

1825
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:07,560
I love both the good 
and the bad things about her.

1826
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:10,680
She can make a big list 
of my shortcomings too.

1827
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:11,760
Ask her.

1828
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:15,320
Yet she loves me a lot.

1829
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,160
This is what our life is.

1830
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:23,720
Remember you had once said 
that we are a perfect couple?

1831
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,240
Do you still feel the same?

1832
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:33,560
This is a strange world, sir.

1833
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:35,880
We all talk about winning hearts...

1834
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,920
...yet, we need to fall 
in love with the face first.

1835
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:49,680
Sir?

1836
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:52,640
Are you feeling comfortable here?

1837
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:55,960
I know it's a small house.

1838
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:00,440
It's not small, Raj.

1839
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:02,960
It's very big.

1840
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:04,320
Sir...

1841
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:07,240
Please have some rice pudding, sir.

1842
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,590
Baldhead!

1843
01:44:24,870 --> 01:44:26,000
Baldie!

1844
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:49,500
[Where I was, there God cannot be, 
where God is, there is no me]

1845
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:54,680
[Very narrow is the street of love 
divine, two cannot pass at the same time]

1846
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:56,000
Say that again.

1847
01:44:58,280 --> 01:44:59,680
Say it. Don't feel scared.

1848
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:06,360
Baldpate, baldhead, boiled egg, hairless...

1849
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,200
Or baldie.

1850
01:45:11,050 --> 01:45:13,280
These are the words we use 
to address a hairless person, don't we?

1851
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:16,800
You haven't said anything wrong.

1852
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:23,760
We are bound call this white 
wall white and this green board green.

1853
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:28,780
The problem doesn't lie 
in the person who says baldie.

1854
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:33,080
The problem lies in the 
person who gets irritated by it.

1855
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:36,080
The problem lies in me.

1856
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:39,560
Where is it written..

1857
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:42,680
..that fair skin is 
good and dark skin is bad?

1858
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:49,440
That the one with hair is 
handsome and the one without is ugly?

1859
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:55,080
That you should laugh at a 
fat person and not at a thin person?

1860
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:56,240
Where is this mentioned?

1861
01:45:58,240 --> 01:45:59,160
We made this.

1862
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:01,560
Our society made this.

1863
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:05,310
We told everyone that 
this is good and this is bad.

1864
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:08,760
We decided who should 
and should not we make fun of.

1865
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:16,840
We taught everyone to say baldhead, 
baldie, dwarf, midget, black.

1866
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:20,850
To laugh and make fun of them.

1867
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,360
And the people at the 
receiving end too have learnt...

1868
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:28,080
..to take offence and 
then try to change themselves.

1869
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:30,240
Why change?

1870
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:35,120
So that no one makes fun of you again?

1871
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:38,360
So that no one teases you again.

1872
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:43,040
I feel sad because..

1873
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:48,160
..what you did to me...

1874
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:52,480
...I ended up doing 
the same to someone else.

1875
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:57,080
I ridiculed her.

1876
01:46:58,040 --> 01:46:58,920
I teased her.

1877
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:02,440
I behaved badly with her.

1878
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:11,200
I judged her for her looks.

1879
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,280
Looks..

1880
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:17,720
..which are given to us by God.

1881
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:21,000
Scientifically speaking, 
our genes decide that.

1882
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:26,160
We have no control over them.

1883
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:37,320
Therefore, henceforth, 
anyone can call me anything they want.

1884
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:40,640
Baldhead, baldpate, baldie.

1885
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:44,600
I wouldn't mind it.

1886
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:50,280
Yours' truly, the bald Hindi professor.

1887
01:48:58,680 --> 01:48:59,360
Sorry...

1888
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:07,720
For calling you fatso in 
my mind the first time I saw you.

1889
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:12,520
Sorry...

1890
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:19,920
For leaving before you 
could finish your noodles.

1891
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:22,720
Sorry...

1892
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:30,840
For making you delete 
our picture from Facebook.

1893
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:35,920
Sorry...

1894
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:45,120
For being so stupid.

1895
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:50,240
Sorry...

1896
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:00,000
For making you feel 
that you lack something.

1897
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:04,640
I don't deserve you.

1898
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:06,280
But...

1899
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:09,160
I love you.

1900
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:19,360
Can you drop me to the Metro Station?

1901
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:32,320
Wait.

1902
01:50:46,230 --> 01:50:47,970
By the way, don't lose your weight..

1903
01:50:48,050 --> 01:50:49,420
You are looking cute in this.

1904
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:51,520
Don't do the hair transplant.

1905
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:52,810
You are looking hot in this.

1906
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:59,360
Mr. Batra, ask the professor 
is he going to Apsara out on a honeymoon?

1907
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:00,880
Or will he take her 
out only for family dinners?

1908
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:02,520
Will you?

1909
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:04,800
- Speak up. 
- I will, next week.

1910
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,480
- Good. 
- Next week.

1911
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:09,800
- Sister-in-law, may I say something? 
- Sure.

1912
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:11,080
They make a lovely couple.

1913
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:12,440
Thank you so much, sister.

1914
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:14,720
By the way, where did you two meet?

1915
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:16,120
- We... 
- Facebook. - Tinder.

1916
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:19,040
What's Tinder?

What happens to this city?
Either there is ash or smoke.

2
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,979
Why doesn't anyone say anything?

3
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:16,211
Why do they tolerate
this smoke quietly?

4
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,848
It's the limit to tolerance.

Let's douse cigarettes and cigars.

00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,317
There is a ban on smoking

Don't smoke, don't let others smoke.

You've to pay dearly for smoking.

Everyone desires happiness.

11
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:46,075
But at what cost?

12
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,017
Smoking costs dearly.

Ram, the name of God,
is eternal truth!

96
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,328
Dad, I'll light the stove
and be back.

97
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,833
- And Sikandar?
- He's up... on his way here.

98
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,744
<i>Mr. Motilal...</i>

99
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,210
Come, have some sweets.

100
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,883
<i>I can't leave my shop unattended.</i>

101
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,044
Come on! Nobody's going
to steal anything.

102
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,715
They've got sweets.
They're from the university, right?

103
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,657
We're doing an anthropology project.

104
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,826
They want to know about our ghats,
enlighten them.

105
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,467
You're our ghat scholar!

106
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,003
And you, our scholar on shady alleys!

107
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,595
The sleazy ones at night!

108
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,671
You're recording this?

109
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,309
Yes sir, one tends to miss
details while writing.

110
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,545
History... Huh?

111
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:07,946
Earlier, the banks of Mother
Ganges were a vast forest.

112
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,279
Cremation rituals began
in the Holy River.

113
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,290
So, various kings set up ghats.

114
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:19,027
Priests from all over
started settling here.

115
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:20,865
Ghats were assigned...

116
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,493
according to state, caste...
and priests.

117
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,195
Did you understand?

118
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,667
The ghat we're sitting on right now...

119
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,207
is under dispute.

120
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,971
Like Kashmir - Yes, like Kashmir.

121
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,443
The Maharasthrians claim
it to be theirs...

122
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:38,506
as so do the Gujratis.

123
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,347
What do we do with this brat?

124
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:45,287
Meet Jhonta. Ghat hero,
running for president...

125
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:49,089
but ask him to get me customers
and he runs like an athlete!

126
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,720
- What happened?
- I was about to...

127
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,331
Bring me my phone!
Hurry up! Now!

128
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:57,297
The Scindia ghat, the one
right next to ours...

129
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,498
I'll look for customers, master!

130
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:04,603
Kids these days are so restless,
always on the run.

131
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,675
And so is this wretched phone.

132
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,112
Misery of modern times!

133
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:13,617
Hello?

134
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:16,448
Yes, speaking.

135
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,523
Look at the ingenuity of
these kids.

136
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,659
She changed into a
saree, all spruced up.

137
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,654
<i>They barely knew each other...</i>

138
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,461
<i>and just look ham!</i>

139
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,191
What for?

140
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,470
What did you tell us a while back?

141
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,300
Say it out loud.

142
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:37,871
Enlighten your father.

143
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,739
<i>What was that phrase?</i>

144
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,074
<i>""Curbing curiosity!""</i>

145
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,046
If l tip off a journalist...

146
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,045
it would make the front page.

147
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:50,945
What is this?

148
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,488
A ï¬le of another department
on my desk?

149
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:55,751
What shit!!

150
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:59,024
Make the corrections and
get out of my face!

151
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,493
What is your name again?

152
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:05,536
Pathak.

153
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,507
Vidhyadhar Pathak

154
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,005
I offer ritual services
at Nandeshwar ghat

155
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,478
I used to be a Sanskrit
professor at the university.

156
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,449
- Now I translate.
- We'll call you in 3 days.

157
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,362
Pay the bail here, and take
your daughter for now.

158
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,360
Mr. Mishra,
what do you mean ""for now""?

159
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,671
If anything happens to the boy...

160
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,468
it'll be a case of
abetment of suicide.

161
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:48,673
Court, media, journalists,
the whole shebang!

162
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,543
No pleading!
Go pay the bail over there.

163
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,813
We're from the same community.

164
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,355
Go pay the bail and get out!

165
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:09,684
Centrifugal force turned into centripetal
and people hit a deadlock there...

166
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,018
so they started moving upwards.

167
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:15,924
And this led to the birth of
Civil Engineering.

168
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,086
Any question?

169
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,630
No, sir!

170
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,466
- You can do this alone.
- Come on, I need the support.

171
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:32,109
Add some flavored corn in it.

172
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,508
Some green chilies on the side.

173
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,636
Roast it properly!

174
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,142
Like always.

175
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,046
Of course, madam!
Exactly the way you want it.

176
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,140
Pooja!

177
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:40,942
Pooja!

178
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,612
Happy Birthday to you!

179
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:49,489
Please?

180
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,687
Thank you.

181
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:51,963
Did you like it?

182
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,130
So when is the birthday treat?

183
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,000
How will she explain
this to her folks?

184
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:58,130
As in?

185
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:01,400
How will she explain who
gave this huge gift?

186
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,506
I'm cool with any excuse.

187
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,634
Oh really? Give this to me.

188
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:06,968
Here, take this back.

189
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,774
No, I got this as a gift.

190
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,816
Gifts are not supposed to be
returned. Come on now!

191
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,407
But what will she tell her folks?

192
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,214
Add more of these peanuts.

193
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,688
- Say something.
- She can say you've gifted it to her.

194
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,282
Like her folks are going
to believe that!

195
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,588
Enough, don't roast it more!
A dash of green sauce too.

196
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,222
More of these chilli ï¬akes as well.

197
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,899
Last time you put very
little garlic in it.

198
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,425
- Be generous this time.
- Yes, madam.

199
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:35,171
Have you ever heard of a girl gifting a
teddy bear to another girl?

200
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:36,703
Don't they?

201
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:41,407
Nor have I ever seen a girl
fuss over a 5 rupee snack!

202
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:44,946
<i>We need to go.</i>

203
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,814
Take this teddy with you.

204
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,978
No, thanks, we're in a hurry!
Let's go.

205
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:54,555
Good morning, master!

206
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,487
I had an early bath today!

207
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,299
You haven't shown up for 3 days.

208
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,963
<i>Mind your own business.</i>

209
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,690
Is your father home?

210
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,094
He's gone to the ghat.

211
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,091
Call him.

212
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,074
The boy is dead.

213
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,393
Did you offer some tea?

214
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:41,493
Have a seat.

215
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,498
Sorry, I'm late.

216
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,669
Well, the boy didn't survive.

217
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,474
They're doing an autopsy and
we'll have the report soon.

218
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,742
Here are the court papers.

219
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:00,985
Please ï¬ll them up.

220
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,248
Wait...

221
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,990
what do we have to do
with the court?

222
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,187
It's a case of abetment of suicide.

223
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,367
But the boy...

224
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,965
killed himself on your watch

225
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,504
I mean... because of
police intimidation.

226
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,311
So now you are acting the Professor?

227
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,708
Here's the thing...

228
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:37,683
you can save your lecture to jerk off
your ghat customers.

229
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:39,818
Okay?

230
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,152
You must have seen it on TV?

231
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,856
The R.K Puram sex scandal,
Jammu and Kashmir sex scandal.

232
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:49,295
<i>Your</i> daughter <i>is</i> now part of
a big sex scandal!

233
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,968
Sir, please suggest a way out.

234
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,305
How much do you earn?

235
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:09,821
Around 8 to 10 thousand rupees.

236
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,483
She earns as well, right?

237
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,183
Yes... at a computer
coaching institute

238
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,791
I won't beat around the bush.

239
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,030
Abetment...

240
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,507
media, court...
I can handle all of that.

241
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,638
But you'll have to
make arrangements

242
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:34,009
3 lakh rupees.
I'm giving you 3 months.

243
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,875
Sir, you've got us wrong.

244
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,709
We're principled people.

245
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:45,020
We can hardly manage 50,000 rupees!

246
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,990
From now on...

247
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:48,451
never ever...

248
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,190
ever... negotiate with me.

249
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,598
Am I selling you a bloody soap?!

250
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,898
I'm hereto save your honour

251
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,804
I have your daughter's sex
scandal video on my phone.

252
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:16,278
One upload and the whole city
will get off on your daughter!

253
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,259
Arrange 1 lakh Rupees in two days.

254
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,622
Don't just nod like a horse!

255
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,722
What will you do?

256
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,925
Arrange 1 lakh Rupees
in two days.

257
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,167
And, after 2 months?

258
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:36,663
2 lakh Rupees.

259
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,942
Is the math really that hard?

260
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,893
Where to Madam?

261
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,335
- To the cremation ghat.
- It's forbidden for women.

262
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,633
Hit the skull hard, 5 times.

263
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,018
Deepak, give him a hand.

264
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,926
Piyush! My son!

265
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:34,694
Harder! Smash the skull
to release the soul!

266
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,035
How many more days
left in college?

267
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,213
Two more months, Dad.

268
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,074
Then exams and placements!

269
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,755
- What?
- I mean job placements.

270
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,590
Don't you need to
pay something to get a job?

271
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:01,425
Not anymore, Mother.

272
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,885
The Railway and Electric companies...

273
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,259
hire on merit.

274
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:19,767
Instead of supervising the ash cleaning,
you're feasting here?

275
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,170
What if the boys steal the
silver?

276
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,641
Uncle Shambhu is supervising it.

277
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,405
Shambu is a pothead!

278
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,315
So? Am I not even
supposed to eat?

279
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,490
How much will the job pay?

280
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,790
They will let me know
after the interview.

281
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:44,958
Great! Get out of this place.

282
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,807
The sooner, the better.

283
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:54,371
Otherwise, even your life will
end up torching bodies.

284
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,244
Bread!

285
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,922
Look what I found,
I think it's silver!

286
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:12,896
Show me!

287
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,763
<i>Throw it you fool. It's aluminium.</i>

288
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,070
Will you ever explain yourself?

289
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,010
I met him at the coaching center

290
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,671
I used to type out his thesis...

291
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,807
and we became friends.

292
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:12,248
That's all?

293
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:18,087
Yes, I felt nice talking to him.

294
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:24,436
Did you even think twice
before doing it?

295
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:27,895
Even once?

296
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:29,698
Did you?

297
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:31,174
Answer me!

298
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:37,939
What?

299
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:46,521
- Cat got your tongue?
- I don't know.

300
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,019
A boy just killed himself.

301
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:56,256
A ransom of 3 lakhs on our heads

302
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,929
l just broke my 1 lakh Rupees
ï¬xed deposit.

303
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,238
You're one step away from jail...

304
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,906
and you say ""l don't know""

305
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,748
I ï¬shed out 26 Rupees.

306
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,687
Please, let me be part
of the competition.

307
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,889
Are you actually asking me
to let you gamble?

308
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:26,897
It's not gambling!

309
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,297
It's sport and
I have become a pro at it.

310
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,768
Why are you acting so smart?

311
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,302
Today I will play, no matter what.

312
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:37,908
Why don't you shut up
and do some work!

313
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,035
Got screwed over by a bull or what?

314
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:45,108
Pooja looks so pretty with the teddy.

315
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,840
Cute, isn't she?

316
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,821
Can you ask
for her friend's name?

317
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,117
How would I ask?

318
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:56,957
""My friend has a crush
on your poetry-reading friend...

319
00:29:57,028 --> 00:30:00,726
give me her name
so he can ask her out?""

320
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,933
OK, how about we send
her a written request?

321
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,799
Deepak is getting
emotional about her.

322
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,665
Like they say...

323
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,206
""Shake the mango all night,

324
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,673
it'll only fall off the tree
when it's time is ripe"".

325
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,141
What is that noise there?

326
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:15,804
Okay, listen...

327
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,344
do you remember what
she looks like?

328
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,483
- Sure?
- Yes.

329
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:24,879
Okay.

330
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,522
This is her college group page.
She's got to be here.

331
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:31,226
Won't you ï¬nd her
in Pooja's album?

332
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:34,290
Of course! She'll be in
Pooja's friend list.

333
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:36,524
Is that her?

334
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:38,167
No.

335
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,295
There... there... That's her!

336
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:43,704
Shaalu Gupta.

337
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,534
Gupta family, eh?

338
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:46,977
Awesome, dude!

339
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:51,107
Now create your Facebook account
and let the ï¬reworks begin!

340
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,050
I mean send her a friend request.

341
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:56,748
Should we?

342
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,122
Yeah.

343
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:04,860
Come one, come all, make big money!
Here's the super competition!

344
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:09,924
In half an hour, increase your gain!
10 rupees turns to 50! 50 turns to 200!

345
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,935
Now listen to the rules.

346
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:16,167
These kids will dive in
and bring out coins!

347
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,537
Bet on the boy you think
will get the most coins.

348
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:22,306
Great! We have your 20 Rupees on Lokua.

349
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,576
Don't think twice!
Just place your bets!

350
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,375
20 Rupees on Netwa.

351
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,280
The competition is about to begin!

352
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:34,049
1... 2...

353
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:44,660
Now let's see who
gets the most coins!

354
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:48,368
<i>Lokua has 3 coins!</i>

355
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:51,966
- Netwa, hurry! Faster!
- Babua's got only one coin this time.

356
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:56,378
Let's see who's winning...
Munna has 6 coins in one dive.

357
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:57,710
Hold your breath folks.

358
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:01,116
- Please let me join in!
- No, just watch.

359
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:09,483
Those who've bet on Netwa,
will get three times their money!

360
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:01,806
Hello?

361
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:02,846
<i>Hello Devi?</i>

362
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,479
Yes?

363
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,675
Where were you hiding
your phone all this while?

364
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,678
<i>You think l am an idiot?</i>

365
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,117
<i>I</i> know what dirty
business you've been upto.

366
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,020
<i>Bloody witch...</i>

367
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:49,319
Move!

368
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:15,842
Hey!

369
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,451
What are you doing here?!

370
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:18,683
Who let you in?

371
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:20,850
I came hereto collect my stuff...

372
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:24,060
and if you make those ï¬lthy calls again,
I'll thrash the hell out of you!

373
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:25,652
He was our top student!

374
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,822
Weren't you ashamed to do it?

375
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,865
Whatever it was, we both
were equally involved.

376
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,957
But he was the only one to die.

377
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:38,368
Sikandar!

378
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,440
Thrust the leg into the
pyre, you idiot!

379
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:46,211
Sikandar!

380
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,046
Looks like the old man is drunk.

381
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,855
Pour me another drink
'King of the Doms'!

382
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:53,717
One more for your health!

383
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,429
Do I look like a king to you?

384
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:04,167
Come on! There are only
two kings in Banaras!

385
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:07,794
One is Kashi Naresh and
the other is the Dom king.

386
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,900
One on that side...

387
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:11,237
and one on this side.

388
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,671
Look at that miserable Shambu.

389
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:18,245
How many 'bonus days' in a year?

390
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,285
Hey! Shambu!

391
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,953
Yes, sir!

392
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,717
Once every 10 years.

393
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,116
Shambhu gets a 'bonus day'
every 10 years!

394
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:31,557
Meaning?

395
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,196
That day...

396
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:38,966
he gets all the money
from every cremation here.

397
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:42,669
Shambu's father...

398
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:47,375
got his 'bonus day' once in a year.

399
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:50,810
Overjoyed by that,
he had ten children.

400
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:52,746
The 'bonus day' got split.

401
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,585
Since the father
had one day in a year...

402
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,458
Shambhu inherited
a tenth of the 'bonus day'

403
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:07,262
Now he has one every 10 years.

404
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,967
When is your next 'bonus day', Shambu?

405
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,332
Never again

406
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:17,766
I sold my rights to Lala.

407
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:21,172
<i>He gave me 1 lakh Rupees for it.</i>

408
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:24,240
<i>I'll live the rest of my life off alms.</i>

409
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,340
If l sell my 'bonus day'...

410
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,680
I'll get over 10 lakh Rupees.
Right, lala?

411
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,944
As if you are ever going
to sell it to me.

412
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,315
Should we sell?

413
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,357
<i>Asking your ignorant son?</i>

414
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,620
He has nothing to do with
our cremation ghat!

415
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,986
He's nothing but an educated fool!

416
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:40,929
You're insulting my son?

417
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,523
I'll never sell my 'bonus day' to you!

418
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,931
As if you'd ever think to do so!

419
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:50,736
Father, I need some money.
For the Durga Puja Carnival.

420
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,943
There, in my shirt.

421
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:54,969
May I take 300 Rupees?

422
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,871
Take as much as you want.

423
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,143
You're the only one!

424
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:11,092
Are you going to the Durga puja
carnival tonight?

425
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,859
20 rupees.

426
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,204
Put the watch in the hat.

427
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,505
Easy! Right inside.

428
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,238
Now it's inside.

429
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:04,577
Now blow into the hat.

430
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,378
The watch has...

431
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:09,746
vanished!

432
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,657
The watch will re-appear...

433
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:14,884
in someone's pocket.

434
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,291
He has it!

435
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,120
Man in the red shirt!

436
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:20,996
Check your pockets.

437
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,290
He found the watch.

438
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,597
Come on stage, young man!

439
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,838
- Your name?
- Deepak

440
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:51,456
I'll never smoke again.
Yesterday, my friends forced me to

441
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:25,387
I deserve at least 12,000 a month
with my qualiï¬cations.

442
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,958
Don't negotiate.
He was my best student.

443
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,818
Professor taught us
till 10th grade.

444
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:34,659
It's thanks to him
that we are what we are.

445
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,490
Tea, please.

446
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,558
No thank you, I have to go...

447
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:41,001
and ï¬nish the book translation.

448
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:43,768
Glass of water?
From the earthenware pot

449
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,767
I received your CV by e-mail.

450
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:49,605
Unfortunately...

451
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,212
we have no positions open
for instructors.

452
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:53,975
We need a receptionist.

453
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:57,516
Welcoming and counseling
new students.

454
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:01,282
<i>Some database work, paid extra.</i>

455
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,486
Comes to 5.5K a month.

456
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,689
Perfect!

457
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,991
She'll start tomorrow.

458
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:09,525
- Thank you so much, Sanjay!
- Oh! Come on, Sir.

459
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,998
<i>It's the least l could do</i>

460
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,866
I must take this call.

461
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,031
Please, have some water.
The new Earthenware pot...

462
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,302
<i>makes the water taste very sweet!</i>

463
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:25,746
He meant 5,500 rupees only.

464
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:29,448
What he meant was a lot of
respect for your father.

465
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,355
Thank you.

466
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:44,835
So you're studying
at the Polytechnic Institute?

467
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:48,566
Yes. Civil engineering, ï¬nal year.

468
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,867
We had a college strike
last year...

469
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:56,538
otherwise, I would have a job by now.

470
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:00,247
What are your hobbies?

471
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:01,981
Music.

472
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:03,645
- Are you a singer?
- No

473
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:08,618
I listen to music,
on radio and on CDs too.

474
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,453
Just music?

475
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,355
I also like poetry a lot!

476
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:13,953
- Poetry?
- Yes.

477
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,624
Bashir Badr...

478
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,027
Akbar Allahabadi...

479
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:18,295
Mirza Ghalib...

480
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,333
You must have at least
heard of Ghalib's name?

481
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:23,367
Yeah.

482
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:28,667
Here, please have some.

483
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:32,715
May I get some sauce?

484
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,147
Schezwan sauce?

485
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,186
May I get some please.

486
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:38,648
Please start - No, after you.

487
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,156
No, you go ï¬rst.

488
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,094
So...

489
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:48,525
now we're friends right?

490
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,305
By the way,""-

491
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:05,847
if you're ever in trouble,
let me know.

492
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:09,520
What will you do?

493
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:11,413
Ill...

494
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,252
sort things out for you...

495
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:15,421
if anyone bothers you...

496
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:17,654
teases you or makes you cry.

497
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:20,622
There are lots of nasty boys
around here.

498
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:21,927
Okay.

499
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,429
What if...

500
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,633
you make me cry?

501
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,068
Me? No... Why?

502
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,645
I'd sort that out for you too.

503
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,990
Write the student's name here,
in capital letters.

504
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:49,856
This is our prospectus
with a complimentary CD.

505
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,450
All the information is in here.

506
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:54,520
Come back tomorrow and it'll be done.

507
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:56,191
Thank you - Thank you.

508
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:07,271
You're quite a sweet talker!

509
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,511
Is this your ï¬rst job?

510
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,310
No.

511
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:16,979
What happened to the previous job?

512
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:19,854
I didn't like the job

513
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,923
I know exactly where
your previous job was.

514
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,696
Enter our ""Match the Face"" contest!

515
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:37,138
Guess the actors
and send us the answers.

516
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:41,144
If you get it right,
you could win a brand new car!

517
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:43,307
Lines are open now...

518
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:58,154
- Do you want to go in?
- Yes!

519
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:00,247
- Please!
- How many coins did you ï¬nd today?

520
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:03,453
More than their fathers ever will!
Please let me compete!

521
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:04,824
OK, relax.

522
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:06,995
Let's go.

523
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:08,694
Run along!

524
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:18,038
Ladies and gentlemen,
the competition has begun!

525
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:20,611
Let's see who ï¬nds the most coins.

526
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,118
Put the coins here.

527
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,124
Dive over there!

528
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:42,660
20 rupees on Jhonta?

529
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:43,791
How much?

530
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,196
Over here!

531
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:53,474
Piyush Agarwal.

532
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,672
HOMETOWN: Allahabad?

533
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:01,781
He passed away.

534
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:04,251
Something tragic happened to him

535
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:06,887
I read about it

536
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,229
I'm from his coaching center.

537
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:14,497
We have some ï¬les
that belonged to him.

538
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:17,090
And he owed us some money.

539
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:20,302
He was to return some
books as well, so...

540
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,234
could I have his address please?

541
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:27,110
Come out now! The game's over.

542
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,509
Who has the most coins?

543
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,509
Hey, Munna!

544
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,413
Who is the winner?

545
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,015
Jhonta!

546
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:38,414
I told you I would win.

547
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:40,718
<i>Jhonta has won 980 Rupees.</i>

548
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:42,519
You were great!

549
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:56,133
<i>Hello?</i>

550
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:09,686
<i>Hide these</i> stars <i>safely in my eyes,
the night</i> will <i>be</i> along <i>one.</i>

551
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:18,152
Wanderers like us, will meet somewhere,
perhaps in the morning light.

552
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:21,025
Then?

553
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:22,155
""And then?""

554
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:24,398
That was it.

555
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:28,905
Sorry, I didn't get it. I mean
I got some of it... it was terriï¬c!

556
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:31,134
You're such a dumbo!

557
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:34,835
And very cute!

558
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:36,537
What did you just say?

559
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:37,910
I didn't say anything.

560
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,178
But I heard that!

561
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,251
If l recite Chakbast, you'll faint!

562
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:49,359
Your birthday's soon, right?
I saw on Facebook.

563
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:50,292
Really?

564
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:52,686
Facebook didn't tell you everything.

565
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,128
What?

566
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:55,693
A Picnic!

567
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:57,197
<i>Shaalu?</i>

568
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:01,132
Mom's calling. We'll talk later.

569
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:01,932
Hold on...

570
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:03,598
What is it?

571
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:07,876
Please call me by my name.

572
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:12,580
Only if you memorize two poems...

573
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,214
then I'll decide.
I have to go now.

574
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:15,977
Hello?

575
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:17,383
Bye.

576
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,751
<i>A poem by Dushyant Kumar.</i>

577
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:28,664
<i>You move like the misty morning train.</i>

578
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:31,234
<i>I tremble like a bridge in the rain.</i>

579
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,694
<i>In the deep jungle of your gaze.</i>

580
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,500
<i>I lose my way, no trail to blaze.</i>

581
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:38,600
<i>Who is it?</i>

582
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:41,639
May I speak with Ramdhari Agarwal?

583
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:44,613
<i>Speaking. Who is this?</i>

584
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,912
I... I...

585
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:51,854
<i>What do you want? Hello?</i>

586
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:54,817
I'm calling from Kashi
Co-operative bank.

587
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:56,984
We have a new scheme

588
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,654
<i>l don't need anything, thank you!</i>

589
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:28,451
I'll come straight to the point.

590
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:31,492
Will you sleep with me?

591
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:32,986
<i>Tell me</i>

592
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:35,598
I won't tell anyone.

593
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,361
You had sex with him too, right?

594
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:43,564
Why are you worried about your wife?
This is good quality stuff.

595
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:46,335
It's too expensive - It is not!

596
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:49,508
Let me give you a discount.

597
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:54,583
Think it over
and come back later, okay?

598
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,248
I quit my job.

599
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,918
<i>Pathak...</i>

600
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:07,123
<i>your daughter hasn't visited
for</i> ages.

601
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:08,364
Good morning.

602
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:14,034
Get out of here.

603
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,831
What?

604
00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:19,738
Should I drown myself with shame?

605
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:21,836
Go away.

606
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,746
Madam just quit her job!

607
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:32,022
What were you thinking?

608
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:33,287
Nothing.

609
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:36,223
""Nothing"", ""l don't know"",
that's all you know!

610
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:38,855
Was I ever hard on you?

611
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:42,722
I've always been liberal...
raised you like a boy.

612
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:45,828
What did I do to deserve
such a scandal?

613
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:47,301
I haven't created any scandal.

614
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,735
Then what is this?

615
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,708
All this scampering for loose
change! What is this?

616
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,574
On the ghat, in the streets...

617
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:58,740
I'm constantly afraid someone
will ask about you! What is this?

618
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:00,112
That's your fear.

619
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,283
Hence, I've decided
not to live here anymore.

620
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:06,951
The smaller the city, the
narrower the world-view.

621
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:09,924
After all this, you're still living
in this house with dignity...

622
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:10,983
- And my world-view is narrow?
- Wow!

623
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,790
How considerate of you, Father!

624
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,295
Should I start paying rent as well?

625
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:18,833
Look at me.

626
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:20,366
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

627
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,960
Why are you taking revenge?

628
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:23,802
Revenge for what?

629
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,000
For Mother!

630
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:33,274
You don't even remember
what she looked like.

631
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,681
You were just 6 years old.

632
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:38,086
Are 6 year-olds blind?

633
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:41,054
I took her to the hospital, didn't l?

634
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:45,595
For 2 days, she begged you
to take her, but you didn't.

635
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,288
Your students mattered more.

636
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:48,727
<i>You did nothing!</i>

637
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,699
I thought it was just fever.
I messed up.

638
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:54,298
But I never neglected you, did l?

639
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:56,863
I left my job at the university,
for your sake!

640
00:52:56,973 --> 00:53:00,637
I ended up selling books
on the ghat, for your sake!

641
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:01,836
You think I killed your mother?

642
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:04,505
So do you think I killed that boy?

643
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,143
Answer me?

644
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:11,148
He killed himself!

645
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:18,454
You're crazy.
You're getting confused

646
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:23,824
I'm not getting confused

647
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:27,861
I will defend my honor

648
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:30,803
I won't go to prison.

649
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,203
You have decided
everything for yourself!

650
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,472
I'm the fool who arranges the money

651
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,810
I'll arrange the ransom too.

652
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,975
Next you'll say you don't even
need a father.

653
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:43,584
Do what you feel like.

654
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:47,450
<i>I tremble like a bridge in the rain.</i>

655
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:50,455
<i>In the deep jungle of your gaze.</i>

656
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,859
<i>I lose my way, no trail to blaze.</i>

657
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,495
<i>I never thought about it.</i>
I <i>like</i> them <i>all.</i>

658
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,900
<i>How can you like all the seasons?</i>

659
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,229
<i>I like the monsoons!</i>

660
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:13,410
You recorded her voice?

661
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:14,245
Brilliant!

662
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:16,115
First, I recorded it on my phone...

663
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:18,245
then I cued songs
based on her words.

664
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:21,655
Well done! The student
has become the master!

665
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:24,024
That's a smart gift, bro!

666
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:27,927
Dude, she's from an upper-caste.

667
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:30,058
Don't get too emotional about her.

668
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:31,964
Does she know
you're from a lower caste?

669
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:38,574
Let her know about it,
then do as you please.

670
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:40,833
Not everyone is progressive.

671
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,811
OK, I'll tell her later.

672
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,641
Come on!
There's lot of time for that.

673
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:50,982
When he gets a job,
none of this will matter.

674
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:53,489
- Give him your motorbike keys.
- Why?

675
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:55,518
He has one more surprise for her.

676
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:57,990
Give the keys!
He'll pay you for the fuel.

677
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:00,321
First word.

678
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:02,292
Plant?

679
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:03,522
Lamp?

680
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,691
Bowl!

681
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:19,243
DeePak!

682
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,250
It's a ï¬ower, not Deepak.

683
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:22,410
DeePak!

684
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,172
Where to?

685
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:53,473
Wherever you want.

686
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:55,313
Get on.

687
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:57,584
Your bag?

688
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:58,586
Sorry!

689
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:02,091
- Shall I sit?
- Yes, sure.

690
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:08,129
You know what we
boys call your bus?

691
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:09,129
What?

692
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:10,629
Chick-Wagon!

693
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:17,437
<i>What is this?</i>

694
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,669
- Is it an eraser?
- Yes.

695
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:27,112
You have ï¬nal year
Civil Engineering books?

696
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:28,173
No sir.

697
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:31,014
- Concrete design?
- No sir.

698
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:32,782
- Structure analysis?
- No sir.

699
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:34,657
You got all your books?

700
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:37,653
Pack these please!

701
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:53,272
You never told me where you live.

702
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:01,108
You know Bhelupur?

703
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:03,652
- Bhelupur?
- Right after that.

704
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,785
My friend Prerna lives there

705
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:09,458
I'll say I'm going there and
I'll visit you.

706
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:11,221
Great idea, right?

707
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:15,632
You'll come to my house?

708
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:19,158
I mean... your parents won't mind?

709
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:22,827
If you don't feel like it, I won't.

710
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:26,136
No, I didn't mean that.

711
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,943
Hey, hold this for a second.

712
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:39,815
This is your birthday gift.

713
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,152
Put them on.

714
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:54,497
Is it audible?

715
00:57:58,675 --> 00:57:59,801
Thank you.

716
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:40,009
Have you ever been to Sangam?

717
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:43,277
I come here often.

718
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:54,295
In few days we'll be off on
a pilgrimage in a bus.

719
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,527
ALL OF US: Uncle, aunt,
grandpa, and grandma.

720
00:58:58,568 --> 00:58:59,694
Will you come along?

721
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,360
- Where?
- With us.

722
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:03,462
With you?

723
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:10,075
I'll have to think about it.

724
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,290
What is it?

725
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:34,160
You must be the youngest
in your family, right?

726
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:37,903
Right! How did you know?

727
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:42,274
The youngest are always chatterboxes.

728
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:48,448
That hurts! Your hand is
like a hammer!

729
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:49,781
It's the ring.

730
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,253
My uncle gave it to me
when I was a kid.

731
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:56,281
It's stuck now.

732
00:59:56,492 --> 00:59:57,982
My ï¬ngers grew...

733
00:59:58,127 --> 00:59:59,925
the ring stayed the same.

734
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:03,728
Everybody loves me
because I'm the youngest.

735
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:08,933
What is it?

736
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:11,169
I don't know.

737
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:29,719
You're the youngest, right?
So I kissed you.

738
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,359
Shaalu.

739
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:47,161
Will you marry me?

740
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:53,034
I don't know.

741
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:57,839
Will your folks agree?

742
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:00,244
I don't know.

743
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:02,613
You want to meet them?

744
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:04,416
Will you introduce me?

745
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:07,549
You won't tell me where you live...

746
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:10,251
but you are in a hurry to
come to my place?

747
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,813
- Shall I go?
- You stay near by?

748
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:40,383
Around the corner,
the house on the left.

749
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:43,891
Where's your house?

750
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:47,023
You said it was near Belupur...

751
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:48,693
Shivala?

752
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,525
Kamacha!

753
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:54,564
OK, I got it.

754
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:56,862
- Durgakund, right?
- Why?

755
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:58,969
What's bothering you?

756
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:04,844
I told you I stay near Bhelupur.
You have nothing else to talk about?

757
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:06,506
I was just joking.

758
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,175
You think this is funny?

759
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:12,180
Want to know where I live?
Come, I'll take you.

760
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:18,358
Come, let me take you there and
curb your curiosity!

761
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:20,359
You want the truth?

762
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,694
I live by Harischchandra Ghat.
I was born and raised there.

763
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:26,560
We burn bodies, light pyres.

764
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:29,498
Me, my father, my uncles,
my brother... all of us, for ages.

765
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,365
Ever see a body burn?

766
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:35,133
Tell me, have you?

767
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:39,582
I see them all day, every day.
I burn the dead, day and night.

768
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:44,142
In the ï¬re, the skin melts
and all that's left is the bones.

769
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:48,987
We smash the skull
and wash the ashes into the Ganges.

770
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:52,187
Can you imagine?
Want to come and see?

771
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:55,397
What happened? Won't you use
your friend's pretext now?

772
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:14,413
Where's my tip?

773
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:15,978
Why?

774
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:20,645
An employment letter from the
government deserves a good tip.

775
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,480
You're the new employee right?

776
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:49,950
Yes.

777
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:51,483
Please have a seat.

778
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:19,980
Just 2 minutes later...

779
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:22,816
and you could have ï¬lled
my water bottle too

780
01:05:23,786 --> 01:05:25,015
I'm Sadhya.

781
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,513
Hello.

782
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:29,525
The railway has printed a great guide.

783
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:36,524
We had to learn without
books, the hard way!

784
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:40,993
Look at this...

785
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:43,334
This is Mr. Mukherjee.

786
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,206
He used to work here
before you joined.

787
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:48,677
He refused to learn computers.

788
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:50,974
- May I use this?
- Yes, sure.

789
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:56,350
Railways relocated him to a remote
area in Rajasthan.

790
01:05:57,386 --> 01:06:00,014
Now he issues train tickets manually.

791
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:04,316
You must be well trained
in computers?

792
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:05,761
Yes.

793
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:07,091
Very nice.

794
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:08,094
Ticket!

795
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:09,159
Good morning.

796
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:11,029
- Where to?
- Lalpur.

797
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:32,678
<i>Shaalu, aunt is calling you.</i>

798
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:47,726
You know...

799
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:50,304
you're not like the other boys!

800
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:52,034
Really? How?

801
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,970
There is a certain
sense of honesty in you.

802
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:58,146
Like the honesty in
Nida Fazli's poetry.

803
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:01,412
Now who is this Nida Fazli?

804
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:05,454
That's how honest you are!

805
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:11,118
The food was delicious...

806
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,689
but the salad was stale.

807
01:07:12,928 --> 01:07:14,794
Even the lentils were brilliant.

808
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:18,597
It better be.
The owner's from our caste.

809
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:48,660
<i>So, you finally called, huh?</i>

810
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,529
It was you who
overreacted that day...

811
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,132
and now you're mad at me?

812
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:54,497
<i>Sorry!</i>

813
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:56,929
I didn't ask for an apology.

814
01:07:57,473 --> 01:07:59,635
- I'm so stupid!
- That's true

815
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:01,642
I have no manners.

816
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:03,612
Even that is true!

817
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:06,581
Where've you reached?

818
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:08,750
<i>Haven't even crossed the state yet.</i>

819
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:10,217
<i>Near the border.</i>

820
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,016
OK, listen...

821
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:14,612
My parents...

822
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:16,682
they...

823
01:08:17,326 --> 01:08:19,260
they'll never approve of you.

824
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:24,422
<i>They're stuck in the past
with their old-fashioned ideas.</i>

825
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:27,399
But I'm with you.

826
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:31,098
With time, parents
do come around.

827
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:34,243
<i>Just get yourself a good job.</i>

828
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:39,446
Yes, I'm doing my best.

829
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:44,711
Placements season is approaching.
I will do my best!

830
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:47,546
That's the spirit!
I'll handle the rest.

831
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:53,494
If it comes to it,
I'll run away with you.

832
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:56,495
<i>OK, lake care! Bye!</i>

833
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:12,143
Hey man! Let's go back!

834
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:13,744
We just came in!

835
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,875
I have a lot to study.

836
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:18,244
Hey, turn the boat around.

837
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:22,618
Sir... extra sheet, please.

838
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:24,952
Thank you

839
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:28,256
I'm doing my ï¬nal year
in civil engineering...

840
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:31,331
from Seth Kinaram Agarwal
Polytechnique College.

841
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:35,028
My career objective is to
pursue a career in engineering...

842
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:37,899
with focus on mechanical drafting.

843
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:42,008
DEEPAK: Can't wait to see you.
I'm about to get a job!

844
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:58,191
Shove the skull inside

845
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:02,687
I'll go get Deepak to help.

846
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:06,026
Hey, Deepak.

847
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:07,534
- What is it?
- Hurry up.

848
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:10,628
Dad's drunk again and there
are lots of bodies to burn.

849
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:12,668
Wake up!

850
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:18,640
<i>Everybody wants to avoid
work in</i> this family!

851
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:20,879
<i>I'm bloody tired of this</i>
bonded <i>labor!</i>

852
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:22,541
<i>Hell, Deepak!</i>

853
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:40,763
Wait up, you thief!

854
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:44,703
One more time and I'll
throw you in these pyres!

855
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:01,356
They have not even covered
the bodies properly.

856
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:04,523
Shambu! Light some pyres there

857
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,050
I'm on it.

858
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:07,788
Bathe this one ï¬rst.

859
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:09,326
DeePak!

860
01:11:13,202 --> 01:11:16,832
Light some pyres over there and
then some more over there.

861
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:17,997
There?

862
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:20,337
Near the edge.
As many as you can.

863
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:22,809
- Shall I ï¬nish here ï¬rst?
- Yes.

864
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:35,555
More sawdust!

865
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:54,371
Sikandar needs more wood.
Go help him.

866
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:07,646
Deepak! Give us a hand.

867
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:24,671
Be careful.

868
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:28,337
Easy.

869
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,474
Did the cops say anything?

870
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:38,376
That the pilgrims' bus fell
into the Ganges.

871
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:39,549
Really?

872
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:42,488
Public aid workers dumped
all the bodies here.

873
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:44,852
Not a single survivor?

874
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:45,984
No.

875
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:55,454
You know...

876
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,351
28 trains stop at this station.

877
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:01,296
Guess how many don't?

878
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:04,928
64!

879
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:08,596
Which means, it's
easy to come here...

880
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:10,496
but it's difï¬cult to leave!

881
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:29,817
Could you check
the status of this ticket?

882
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:31,319
<i>Listen... l know it was fun.</i>

883
01:15:31,426 --> 01:15:32,689
But we need to get back now.

884
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:33,920
One more day.

885
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:35,563
Not conï¬rmed yet.

886
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:38,258
Could you check the last
minute availabilities?

887
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:40,358
Even one seat for both of us is ï¬ne.

888
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:42,368
One seat? I like that...

889
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:54,039
No seats available.

890
01:15:54,516 --> 01:15:56,382
- Any cancellations?
- None whatsoever!

891
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:04,457
Come and see this amazing competition!

892
01:16:04,526 --> 01:16:06,392
Never before seen!

893
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:07,428
Jhonta!

894
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:09,528
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

895
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:11,326
these kids will dive.

896
01:16:11,433 --> 01:16:12,332
Jhonta!

897
01:16:12,434 --> 01:16:15,768
He's not here. Bet on someone else.

898
01:16:16,471 --> 01:16:19,133
Put your money on Babua.
He's sure to win!

899
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:20,665
Put it on Babua.

900
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:22,141
- How much?
- 200 Rupees.

901
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:24,178
Professor bets 200 on Babua!

902
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:27,044
Get ready

903
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:28,440
1...

904
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:29,541
2...

905
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:35,654
- Can you see anything in my mouth?
- No!

906
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:38,284
Now I'll put this ball in my mouth.
Watch closely!

907
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:50,839
Now... 1... 2... and...

908
01:16:56,078 --> 01:16:57,705
Here's your share.

909
01:16:57,813 --> 01:17:00,976
- I deserve at least 500 Rupees.
- We'll adjust it next time.

910
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:04,878
How much did you lose?

911
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:23,535
Look how late it is!

912
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:32,803
Do you hear me?

913
01:17:33,448 --> 01:17:35,007
Turned mute, have you?

914
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:38,151
Where were you?

915
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:39,243
Having fun.

916
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:43,656
Are you hereto work or have fun?

917
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:46,461
I'm having fun with my own money!
Why is your ass on ï¬re?

918
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:47,518
Shut up!

919
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:50,127
Those other orphan kids
have ruined you.

920
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:51,723
Show some respect!

921
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:57,537
You will not go anywhere
during a competition.

922
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,008
Acting like the king of Banaras!

923
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:01,570
Throwing money down the drain!

924
01:18:01,643 --> 01:18:02,872
I'll tell Devi!

925
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:05,072
Do what you want.

926
01:18:05,947 --> 01:18:07,574
Sit your butt here!

927
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:09,417
Don't you dare move.

928
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:11,614
Sit down!

929
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:13,883
Such arrogance!

930
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:17,159
From now on,
I want all your winnings.

931
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:36,274
<i>The internship discussion topic is...</i>

932
01:18:36,678 --> 01:18:39,545
the effects of industrialization...

933
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:42,611
on human life and on society at large.

934
01:19:13,815 --> 01:19:15,476
Say something, Deepak.

935
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:21,317
You've been quiet for
a really longtime.

936
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:28,686
No, it's okay. Take your time

937
01:19:32,834 --> 01:19:34,825
""l like poetry...""

938
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:45,641
""You move like the
misty morning train...""

939
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:50,611
I tremble like a bridge in the rain"".

940
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:17,307
""If it comes to that,
I'll run away with you.""

941
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:39,291
When does this grief ever end?

942
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:53,114
Deepak, get up!

943
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:00,355
You're being crazy!

944
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:13,461
You need to control yourself.

945
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:21,466
Hey Deepak, take my bike keys.

946
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:24,546
Shaalu!!!

947
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:50,767
You promised the translation
would be done by today.

948
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:53,072
The printers are sitting idle.

949
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:55,070
Mr. Pathak?

950
01:21:55,844 --> 01:21:57,243
Is everything OK?

951
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:01,508
I'll deliver it within 3 days

952
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:03,273
3 more days?

953
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:05,410
Devi's not keeping
well these days.

954
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:10,117
Mr. Verma...

955
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:13,127
could you give me an
advance please?

956
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:16,528
You've already kept me
hanging like a bat.

957
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:21,200
<i>Still, I can't say no.</i>

958
01:22:21,636 --> 01:22:23,070
Here you go.

959
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:25,562
It's ï¬ne.

960
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:27,467
Good bye!

961
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:39,754
Sorry for the delay!

962
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:50,359
How much is this?

963
01:22:53,168 --> 01:22:54,829
30,000 Rupees for now...

964
01:23:00,508 --> 01:23:01,634
Come with me.

965
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,674
See that gate over there?

966
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:12,845
Yes.

967
01:23:12,954 --> 01:23:15,013
There's a shop opposite.

968
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:17,180
""Pappu scrap dealer.""

969
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:20,052
Sell this crappy old engine
for 10 or 15,000 Rupees.

970
01:23:21,129 --> 01:23:23,257
The thing is we are trying...

971
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:26,266
I think we'll be able to complete
the payment soon.

972
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:27,961
You think this is a joke?

973
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:33,368
This is not enough.

974
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:36,876
Are you a child?

975
01:23:37,145 --> 01:23:39,739
I'll pay the rest this week.

976
01:23:40,448 --> 01:23:41,882
Please take this.

977
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,550
You better clear it this week...

978
01:23:51,726 --> 01:23:53,524
and complete the balance
by next month.

979
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:07,908
Money?

980
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:13,715
Please hurry, sir!

981
01:24:15,283 --> 01:24:17,183
- Where to?
- Howrah.

982
01:24:17,285 --> 01:24:18,252
As a ""Devi""...

983
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:20,617
you should have 4 arms on each side

984
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:23,783
8 tickets in record speed!

985
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:28,056
Sir, please hurry.

986
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:30,194
What's the rush?

987
01:24:34,202 --> 01:24:36,000
My father says...

988
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:37,730
if you haven't tasted kheer...

989
01:24:38,173 --> 01:24:41,370
you're missing one of life's
greatest pleasures.

990
01:24:43,812 --> 01:24:45,075
Here, have some.

991
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:47,038
No, you have it.

992
01:24:47,148 --> 01:24:48,582
That goes without saying.

993
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:51,209
Father's cooked it himself.

994
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:52,983
It's his birthday today.

995
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:55,156
Oh, OK.

996
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:03,697
Wow - Isn't it delicious?

997
01:25:03,798 --> 01:25:04,788
Yes very.

998
01:25:12,807 --> 01:25:14,241
Do you live alone?

999
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:16,536
No, I live with my father.

1000
01:25:17,045 --> 01:25:18,535
Father lives alone

1001
01:25:21,483 --> 01:25:23,349
I mean, he's alone during the day.

1002
01:25:30,492 --> 01:25:31,960
'Kheer""?

1003
01:25:33,661 --> 01:25:36,460
Haven't cooked it in
a while, so I thought...

1004
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:41,529
l just had dinner. Keep it,
I'll have it tomorrow.

1005
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:46,535
Have it, please.

1006
01:25:48,543 --> 01:25:50,443
You're so fond of it.

1007
01:25:57,886 --> 01:25:59,183
It's good.

1008
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:01,987
Is there any milk left for
tomorrow morning?

1009
01:26:04,526 --> 01:26:05,516
What is it?

1010
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:08,225
I completed a month
at work today. So...

1011
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:09,794
it's my salary cheque.

1012
01:26:11,132 --> 01:26:12,531
How much?

1013
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:13,965
20 thousand Rupees.

1014
01:26:15,537 --> 01:26:16,902
Great!

1015
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,408
Come, sit next to me.

1016
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:28,141
You never told me your
job was conï¬rmed.

1017
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:30,607
It's temporary

1018
01:26:31,286 --> 01:26:34,688
I'll work until we arrange
the ransom money.

1019
01:26:34,989 --> 01:26:35,854
Then...

1020
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:37,049
And then?

1021
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:47,459
I'm planning to take up a
course at Allahabad university

1022
01:26:48,803 --> 01:26:52,137
I'll work part-time
near the university.

1023
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:54,138
You want to move out?

1024
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:03,876
Yes.

1025
01:27:05,653 --> 01:27:06,814
Why?

1026
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:10,981
If it wasn't for this <i>case,</i>
I would have already left.

1027
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:18,495
Maybe I'm better off alone.

1028
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:20,961
Allahabad isn't too far.

1029
01:27:21,269 --> 01:27:23,636
- I'll come back here once in a while.
- What about your father?

1030
01:27:31,312 --> 01:27:33,440
I don't ï¬t in your life anywhere?

1031
01:27:38,152 --> 01:27:40,678
If you've ï¬gured out so much then...

1032
01:27:42,457 --> 01:27:43,515
Go

1033
01:27:46,995 --> 01:27:49,430
I did not kill your mother!

1034
01:27:54,569 --> 01:27:57,061
I'll quietly sleep on the ghat!

1035
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:01,902
Father, please!

1036
01:28:06,748 --> 01:28:08,580
Don't cry, please.

1037
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:15,329
Narrow gauges are still used
in hilly areas.

1038
01:31:15,837 --> 01:31:20,206
Broad-gauge technology
will eventually replace it.

1039
01:31:20,675 --> 01:31:23,076
- Graduated ï¬rst in your class?
- Yes.

1040
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:25,947
You're hired for a six-month trial
in Allahabad.

1041
01:31:26,881 --> 01:31:28,815
Thank you, sir - Congratulations.

1042
01:32:00,181 --> 01:32:02,548
<i>Now we're on it completely.</i>

1043
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:08,555
Even Devi's now got a temporary job

1044
01:32:12,159 --> 01:32:14,685
I have a feeling we'll
pay the dues soon

1045
01:32:17,732 --> 01:32:20,497
6th of the next month
is your last day to pay up.

1046
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:24,529
Or else the video's going up
on YouTube

1047
01:32:26,274 --> 01:32:28,072
I'm sure you know
what YouTube is?

1048
01:32:37,084 --> 01:32:38,574
Dad, shall we leave?

1049
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:45,590
Yes, let's go.

1050
01:32:50,531 --> 01:32:53,159
<i>Today on the eve of Maha Shivratri.</i>

1051
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:55,566
We <i>will</i> have the
biggest competition till date.

1052
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:56,967
<i>So on this note.</i>

1053
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:59,234
All hail in the name of...
Lord Mahadev!

1054
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:01,274
All okay?

1055
01:33:01,909 --> 01:33:04,344
Take down my bet - How much?

1056
01:33:05,046 --> 01:33:06,275
10,000 Rupees.

1057
01:33:06,347 --> 01:33:09,044
- You'll win right?
- Obviously!

1058
01:33:14,055 --> 01:33:16,149
Did you know Devi...

1059
01:33:18,192 --> 01:33:21,162
there's always one
friend in every group...

1060
01:33:21,495 --> 01:33:23,463
who is considered the most wise.

1061
01:33:23,864 --> 01:33:24,456
Yes.

1062
01:33:24,532 --> 01:33:27,934
Back in college... I used
to be that intellectual.

1063
01:33:30,972 --> 01:33:34,670
All my friends used to seek
my help with their problems.

1064
01:33:35,142 --> 01:33:37,133
My advice to everyone...

1065
01:33:37,678 --> 01:33:41,046
whatever is in your heart,
say it out loud!

1066
01:33:41,148 --> 01:33:43,344
Hiding will get you nothing.

1067
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:55,859
<i>Let's see who is going to win today!</i>

1068
01:33:56,364 --> 01:33:57,991
Jhonta, dive there!

1069
01:34:01,435 --> 01:34:03,096
Hurry up! Faster!

1070
01:34:04,505 --> 01:34:05,529
On the extreme end.

1071
01:34:07,308 --> 01:34:09,834
Now that you're leaving...

1072
01:34:10,277 --> 01:34:14,339
I think it's time I should
listen to the ""intellectual"" inside me...

1073
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:19,685
and tell you what is in my heart.

1074
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:26,793
Jhonta!

1075
01:34:32,066 --> 01:34:33,056
Jhonta!

1076
01:34:34,735 --> 01:34:36,635
Dive, Munna!

1077
01:34:42,009 --> 01:34:43,204
Everything okay?

1078
01:34:45,946 --> 01:34:47,038
<i>Sorry</i>

1079
01:34:48,015 --> 01:34:49,540
I have to leave.

1080
01:34:59,593 --> 01:35:01,687
Give way, move!

1081
01:35:01,796 --> 01:35:03,821
Everybody move from here!

1082
01:35:03,931 --> 01:35:04,898
Give way!

1083
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:07,964
Jhonta!!!

1084
01:35:08,035 --> 01:35:10,902
I won't ever let you play
this game, my child!

1085
01:35:31,058 --> 01:35:31,957
What?

1086
01:35:32,026 --> 01:35:34,290
I lost all your money, isn't it?

1087
01:35:36,363 --> 01:35:37,159
No.

1088
01:36:01,956 --> 01:36:03,082
What happened?

1089
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:05,423
Want to see a magic trick?

1090
01:36:07,528 --> 01:36:09,394
Do you see anything in my hand?

1091
01:36:11,632 --> 01:36:14,260
Anything in this one?

1092
01:36:14,502 --> 01:36:15,469
No.

1093
01:36:15,669 --> 01:36:17,535
Anything in my mouth?

1094
01:36:22,176 --> 01:36:24,167
1...2... 3...

1095
01:36:32,153 --> 01:36:33,177
Whose is it?

1096
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:34,785
It's for you.

1097
01:36:35,956 --> 01:36:36,855
Where did you ï¬nd it?

1098
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:39,722
Found it in the river
while diving.

1099
01:36:58,078 --> 01:36:59,477
Yes, great!

1100
01:37:04,585 --> 01:37:05,575
Thank you.

1101
01:37:44,992 --> 01:37:46,050
It's hot!

1102
01:37:47,061 --> 01:37:49,291
I've packed lunch.
Have it on the train.

1103
01:37:49,463 --> 01:37:50,931
You eat, I'll pack.

1104
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:02,274
It's lovely.

1105
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:14,215
Shall we go?

1106
01:38:25,532 --> 01:38:26,658
Blessings.

1107
01:38:26,767 --> 01:38:28,292
Call me once you reach

1108
01:38:29,603 --> 01:38:31,401
I'm off - Hurry up.

1109
01:38:31,839 --> 01:38:33,136
Step back.

1110
01:38:40,114 --> 01:38:42,515
Go sit - See you soon, Dad.

1111
01:39:43,944 --> 01:39:45,173
Hello!

1112
01:39:46,046 --> 01:39:48,845
I'm hereto see Mr. Ramdhari Agarwal

1113
01:39:49,249 --> 01:39:51,047
I am Devi Pathak.

1114
01:39:51,919 --> 01:39:55,412
Piyush was my friend. That day...

1115
01:39:55,489 --> 01:39:58,254
Hold on. It's better we talk inside!

1116
01:40:25,152 --> 01:40:28,452
- What are you doing? Are you crazy?
- Why have you come here?

1117
01:40:28,522 --> 01:40:29,990
Are you okay?

1118
01:40:31,058 --> 01:40:32,150
Why?

1119
01:40:32,726 --> 01:40:34,751
What harm did he ever do to you?

1120
01:42:27,141 --> 01:42:28,438
Water?

1121
01:43:11,351 --> 01:43:14,252
30 rupees to go to Sangam!

1122
01:43:15,455 --> 01:43:16,945
Come on, miss!

1123
01:43:17,457 --> 01:43:18,856
And you, sir?

1124
01:43:19,126 --> 01:43:20,651
I'll take you to Sangam.

1125
01:44:15,148 --> 01:44:17,014
Is this your ï¬rst visit to Sangam?

1126
01:44:17,451 --> 01:44:18,441
Yes.

1127
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:20,978
And you?

1128
01:44:21,822 --> 01:44:23,119
Second time.

1129
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:29,122
Someone once said you must visit
Sangam twice in a lifetime.

1130
01:44:29,663 --> 01:44:30,630
Why?

1131
01:44:30,697 --> 01:44:32,995
Alone the ï¬rst time, and with
someone the second time around

1132
01:44:33,019 --> 01:44:49,019

tt5946128,Dear Zindagi,"1
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:55,339
Priya, listen to me

2
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,538
Let go of me

3
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,446
You always do this,
it's always other women

4
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,002
I didn't mean to hurt you

5
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:02,602
Every time you say the same thing

6
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:04,005
You know how much I love you

7
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:05,546
Please, listen to me

8
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,106
I love you so much

9
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:13,534
Cut!

10
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:18,569
Kaira, good for you?

11
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:43,507
Guys we'll do one more

12
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:45,271
We got this shot right?

13
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,540
We are running out of time, we don't
have permission for the whole day...

14
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,944
Kaira has a nice idea,
we'll do one more

15
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,439
What's the point of finishing
on time if we don't get a good shot?

16
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:57,309
Look, no respect for producers

17
00:02:57,567 --> 00:03:00,878
Especially these new
cameramen... sorry... women

18
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:03,172
Come on, hurry up, let's do this!

19
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,211
Fatima, we are going to change the guy

20
00:03:06,267 --> 00:03:07,109
You want the other guy?

21
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:10,207
He's got to look a little sexy

22
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,404
Get the camera

23
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:35,237
Cut!

24
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:36,104
Got that?

25
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:37,407
Fantastic!

26
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,408
Superb execution!

27
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:40,138
Good shot

28
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,806
I shot it at 48 frames,
speed up the end if you like

29
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:44,574
I'm going to take a
plate of the building now

30
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:48,369
Saw the shot Raghuvendra?

31
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:52,575
That one expression of the girl
checking out the passing guy says so much

32
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:57,176
I wish I had met Kaira earlier, I
would have shot the whole film with her

33
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:02,343
I got that

34
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:04,007
It's a wrap guys! Thank you!

35
00:04:07,267 --> 00:04:09,804
Told you, don't have to carry my bag

36
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,808
I'm so sorry

37
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:18,176
Your mom called on
my cellphone earlier...

38
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,006
you never pick up yours...

39
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:21,746
please call her back,
before you take off

40
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,270
I will, you enjoy your mini holiday

41
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,747
You could have enjoyed
Singapore with us...

42
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:30,270
but you wanted to
fly with someone else

43
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,243
Shut up

44
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,779
Go go

45
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:39,779
I tried to upgrade you, couldn't do it

46
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:40,937
Please

47
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:42,439
Hi guys what can I get for you?

48
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,911
Beer
- Coke

49
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:45,468
Just Coke?

50
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:50,138
I drink only on two occasions,
when I am in love and when I am not

51
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:52,434
<i>Okay...</i>

52
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,338
Cheers!

53
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:02,271
Kaira, everything okay?

54
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,209
As in we're good right?

55
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:07,248
What are you talking about,
what happened to us?

56
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:09,407
Cheers!

57
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:21,681
Raghuvendra, I want to
shoot an entire feature film...

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,274
enough of this patchwork

59
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,337
I mean I can't keep waiting
for other cameramen to fall ill...

60
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:28,845
no one will even know
that I've shot this scene

61
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,403
I want to shoot my own film

62
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,678
You will

63
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:36,408
Who wouldn't want to work
with a hot DOP like you?

64
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:37,338
Hot!

65
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,743
Is that my only talent, seriously?

66
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,938
Seriously

67
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,370
Don't talk to me

68
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:45,071
Of course you're talented...

69
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:47,875
You are shooting so many
ads...earning good money

70
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:49,435
Ads and all are fine

71
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,407
I want to shoot a film

72
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:53,810
You will, you will, soon

73
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,779
And you're so young, I mean...

74
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,404
you wear zero number
glasses to look older

75
00:05:58,767 --> 00:05:59,802
Excuse me?

76
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:03,872
If actresses can be at their peak at
a young age then why not technicians?

77
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:06,277
Have you heard of the word 'Patience'?

78
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,607
No I haven't, tell me about 'Patience'

79
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,905
Pick up...

80
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:16,878
pick up the cook's call...

81
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:20,342
if you want I can
just go and come back

82
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,308
He is not a cook,
he is the owner of a restaurant

83
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:25,313
Not even a cook?

84
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:30,976
That shot was your idea right?

85
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:34,310
Girl with guy, checking out other guy?

86
00:06:34,633 --> 00:06:37,375
Inspired from life?

87
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,102
Listen Kaira...

88
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:43,974
you take my seat, I'll take yours...

89
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,272
I can sit in Economy class,
no need to sacrifice

90
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,177
Your long legs won't
fit in there anyway

91
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:51,168
That is true

92
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:52,234
It is very true

93
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,347
Yes Mom, it was good

94
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:59,914
Can't talk now,
the plane is going to take off

95
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:01,002
Bye!

96
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,043
So...

97
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,238
can I come up?

98
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,075
I'm really tired

99
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:50,111
Dinner?

100
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,078
I'm busy, but I'll see you

101
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:02,907
Alka!

102
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,035
<i>Didi! (Sister)</i>

103
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:06,469
You've become so fat!

104
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:10,104
L-low was your flight'?

105
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:25,774
Your mother called 3 times

106
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:35,205
You are so sweet Alka

107
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:36,810
Thank you!

108
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,843
Do you want coffee
or shall I serve breakfast?

109
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:42,645
Later

110
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,679
Didi...

111
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:52,742
this guy is so cute

112
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,738
Was cute!

113
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:56,571
Was!

114
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:59,044
I don't find him cute anymore...

115
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,637
just take down his photo

116
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,011
I just put it all in perfect order

117
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,471
Now it's perfect

118
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:42,674
So then, how was your trip'?

119
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,039
It was good

120
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:46,073
Just good?

121
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:48,912
Okay, great

122
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:56,910
You look beautiful sweetheart

123
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:12,673
Sorry, I'll just...

124
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:17,478
No it's okay, go ahead

125
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:19,910
Table for 4 please?

126
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:22,504
I'm sorry guys,
we have a strict dress code

127
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:23,773
No shorts and slippers please

128
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,608
Come on, it's his birthday

129
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,805
I'm sorry, wish I could

130
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:29,739
But she's wearing shorts!

131
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,939
It's okay for girls, I'm sorry guys

132
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:52,573
Just this once, only for you

133
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:58,808
Next time I'll come along
on shoot with you, as your caterer

134
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:00,803
What do you say?

135
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,341
I slept with Raghuvendra

136
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,476
I should go...

137
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,874
Sid...

138
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:50,378
I'm sorry

139
00:12:58,467 --> 00:13:00,344
What are you doing!

140
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:14,447
It's all good!

141
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,712
It's okay, it's all good...

142
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,903
Hey look, Sid!

143
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,508
Shit! Where?

144
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,641
That's not Sid, Jackie

145
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,871
He looked so much like him...cute

146
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:45,838
Poor thing, nice guy he was

147
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,504
Really nice

148
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:49,911
Little too nice for you right?

149
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,779
Oh my God! This jacket!

150
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,181
It reminds me of school,
our 'Famous Five' gang

151
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:03,778
Was that the 8th or 9th grade?

152
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,143
10th grade, same one

153
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,680
See, I can have a long
term relationship too

154
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:11,406
Yes, with things

155
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:13,346
So are we things too?

156
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,437
Yes, you are a thing

157
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:17,802
Sorry

158
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:20,643
Have you gone blind in love?
Am I invisible?

159
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,872
We said sorry

160
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,838
Staring into her eyes!

161
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,844
They are a couple

162
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,779
'Oh my coochie coo'
'So sweet I love you'...

163
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,313
The same rubbish crap it's irritating

164
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:33,778
What are you doing?

165
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:35,841
Go to hell!

166
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:40,178
Stupid! Hate couples!

167
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:50,246
Are you guys here to help
me or to do a comedy show?

168
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,210
Both

169
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:54,373
Guys I have a deadline, I have
to show the director the costumes

170
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:55,571
Fine

171
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,437
Raunak do you need help?

172
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,208
Listen, I've to go,
I have my 'BD' appointment

173
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,405
What's this 'BU?

174
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:04,208
'Brain Doctor', my therapist

175
00:15:04,267 --> 00:15:07,248
Oh 'BD'... Raunak you're
still going to that 'BU?

176
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,176
I have to

177
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:10,770
'Brain Doctor'?
Why are you seeing a therapist?

178
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:11,777
Are you mad?

179
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:14,272
Who isn't? Look at him

180
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,577
That's a cut, nice

181
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:27,636
<i>Good for you Kara?</i>

182
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,770
Good for me

183
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:33,638
<i>Rubbish I
can direct better than this!</i>

184
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:50,069
Tell me something...

185
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:54,437
Why did you start
seeing your therapist?

186
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,646
So that you could
tell everyone you're gay?

187
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:01,407
<i>No</i>

188
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:06,143
So that I could tell myself, I'm gay

189
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:15,273
When is your flight to Goa?

190
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:18,780
Don't remind me I can't
believe I'm going to Goa

191
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:22,242
You're the first human
being who's saying this so sadly

192
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,741
It's Goa! Enjoy

193
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:26,311
Shut up

194
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:27,773
And yes it is sad...

195
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:29,546
Because I'm going on duty

196
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:32,511
Every 2-3 months
have to go show my face

197
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,778
Raghu?

198
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:36,273
Duty!

199
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:39,577
Yes mom, I'm coming tomorrow

200
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,043
What's with this food every time!

201
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:48,309
Make what you like,
don't ask me I'm busy

202
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,704
Mothers! Same standard
question every time...

203
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:55,474
'What will you eat' 'What to make'

204
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:58,480
Either she isn't my real
mother or she's had a memory loss

205
00:16:58,533 --> 00:16:59,341
Kaira!

206
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,505
At least eat my food...

207
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:03,476
Only way to handle the torture...

208
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:06,241
I think this time I'll
work on my short film

209
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,438
Short film

210
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:11,038
The longest project of this century

211
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:12,043
That's so bitchy

212
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:12,634
It's true

213
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,577
l-low do you like my French food'?

214
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,373
Landlord? I'm not answering

215
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:19,175
I don't know about French
food but this dip is amazing

216
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:21,213
Full Indian spice, try it

217
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:24,976
The dip is from Kaira's fridge
I have made the puff pastries

218
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:28,473
Jackie, at last you made something

219
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:30,035
What do you mean, at last?

220
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:33,703
You film people think that
only you do important work...

221
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:35,537
and the rest of us are useless?

222
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:38,570
I have decided to work on myself

223
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:41,011
That's tough work

224
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,306
Do n, do it

225
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,938
What's wrong with you?

226
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,206
I'm not going to Goa

227
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,075
Guess what?

228
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:51,374
'Raghu' your friend called...

229
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:55,210
and I have to shoot
a music video here in 3 days

230
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:56,075
Now get ready

231
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:56,508
<i>0K6'!</i>

232
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:59,275
I have never seen anybody
so excited not going to Goa

233
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,870
No Goa

234
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,404
What happened to her?

235
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:11,135
It's not because of my food

236
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,644
Okay everybody,
just get away from the table

237
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,208
This food is contaminated

238
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,311
<i>Hey Fats.</i> . <i>.you good?</i>

239
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:21,902
<i>Koko</i>

240
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:22,274
Yes

241
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,471
Guess what?

242
00:18:24,133 --> 00:18:25,043
What's up?

243
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,440
I'm pregnant!

244
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,410
What?

245
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:29,241
It wasn't Jackie's food

246
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,873
Oh my God Fatty! Congratulations!

247
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:34,578
I mean we're supposed
to be happy right?

248
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:38,144
I don't know...
I want to throw up right now

249
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:44,109
Should I go?

250
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:45,145
Yes please

251
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,137
No I'm just kidding

252
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:48,910
I'm just very excited

253
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:50,512
Are you pregnant too?

254
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:55,179
So I was working on a co-production
with this New York film company...

255
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:56,571
and it has come through

256
00:18:58,867 --> 00:18:59,868
Thank you

257
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,938
Wow, you are going to be
shooting a feature in the US?

258
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,501
Yes

259
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,108
Tell me more...good script?

260
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:05,872
Superb

261
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:08,140
Are you going to be
filming 'in' New York?

262
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,009
You are going to
be filming in New York

263
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,340
As in 'we' are going
to be filming in New York

264
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:17,979
If you're not available
we'll get another camera person...

265
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:20,138
Oh my God...l will kill you!

266
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:24,843
Told you, not going to Goa is lucky

267
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:28,080
Lucky for you, unlucky for me...

268
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,108
I want to kill my husband...

269
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:32,176
You're sure right?

270
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:35,442
It's not because
you think I'm hot right?

271
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:38,277
Obviously... you think
it's because you're talented?

272
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:44,238
What's wrong with your head?
Why are you so complicated?

273
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,280
You're the best,
that's why you got the job...

274
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,311
Simple

275
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,271
Thank you, appreciate it

276
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,241

00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:27,110
<i>Basically basically basically.</i> ..

290
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:29,841
<i>I</i> 'm a rascal

291
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,141
It's a wrap!

292
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:45,110
Hi mommy, congratulations!

293
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:46,737
Fatima the fatty!

294
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,870
Cute gUY

295
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:57,173
So many men in your life

296
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:57,768
Shut up

297
00:21:57,867 --> 00:21:59,972
You'll also get to spend
time with Raghu also...

298
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:02,843
when you're in New York,
shooting for 3 months

299
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,709
Hello ladies, and one gent

300
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,439
Oh hello?

301
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,236
Oh sorry two gents

302
00:22:07,933 --> 00:22:11,312
Can I steal Kaira for a minute?

303
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:14,109
Thief! Even we want to hear

304
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:14,702
What?

305
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,938
Even we want to hear!

306
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,843
What? I can't hear anything

307
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,972
Okay pose

308
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,743
Nice one

309
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:33,004
So I'm off to New York tonight

310
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:34,177
What?

311
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:35,211
Yes

312
00:22:35,433 --> 00:22:38,414
The financiers want to meet urgently

313
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:42,877
Someone has to fly so that you can

314
00:22:44,167 --> 00:22:47,740
OK go, fly...

315
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,369
Have a nice flight

316
00:22:49,433 --> 00:22:50,377
That's it?

317
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:53,007
Have a nice flight?

318
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:54,434
What else do I say?

319
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,737
Say something

320
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,371
You pulled me here,
you say something

321
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,806
Firstly stop looking so hot

322
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:04,769
Tie your hair up

323
00:23:09,267 --> 00:23:11,338
And behave yourself,
just for two weeks

324
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:14,943
Here you g0, haPPW'

325
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:16,109
Very happy

326
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:17,077
l-low do I look'?

327
00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:18,908
Lovely

328
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:23,805
So I had to talk to
you about something...

329
00:23:25,233 --> 00:23:27,110
Do you want to hit the dance floor?

330
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:29,207
<i>Hi Justin Bieber</i>

331
00:23:30,067 --> 00:23:32,104
We're just in the
middle of a conversation

332
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:38,139
Anyway, you were saying

333
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,077
I was saying that...

334
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:42,968
Gautami...

335
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:43,702
Who?

336
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,974
Gautami Sharma will be
the line producer of the film...

337
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,972
OK, so?

338
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,337
The financiers have recommended her...

339
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,375
they think she is the
best person for this job

340
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,079
What are you trying to say?

341
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,672
Gautami and I, many years ago...

342
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,642
were in a relationship

343
00:24:06,867 --> 00:24:10,110
Okay, it's a reunion! That's amazing

344
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,708
Reunion my foot...

345
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,212
It's going to be a
really awkward situation

346
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:17,180
I mean she was such a weird one...

347
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:18,906
I don't even feel like seeing her

348
00:24:19,867 --> 00:24:25,044
I just want the job to go smoothly,
and I thought you should know

349
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:27,908
Cool, whatever

350
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,273
What Whatever'? Come here...

351
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,141
Anyway I've had someone else
on my mind for a while now

352
00:24:47,967 --> 00:24:49,742
Look I think...

353
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:55,848
it's time that we got
serious about each other

354
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,905
I think it's time that you go

355
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:03,140
Do you want to miss your flight?

356
00:25:04,034 --> 00:25:06,776
Kaira I'm serious, I'm not kidding

357
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,902
We really should...

358
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:17,113
We have a flight to catch...

359
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:18,202
It's late

360
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:20,139
Okay 0K3)'

361
00:25:20,233 --> 00:25:24,477
Go, it's okay, it's cool

362
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:25,535
Really?

363
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:28,078
You don't have anything to say?

364
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:32,505
No, that's it for now

365
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:34,046
Bye

366
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,110
What did I miss?

367
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:39,202
Shots!

368
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,677
<i>So, let's break up</i>

369
00:26:16,767 --> 00:26:18,644
<i>Oh my dear</i>

370
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:20,144
<i>Let's break up</i>

371
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,778
<i>Oh please say yes</i>

372
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,439
<i>You and I will never work out,
oh let me go</i>

373
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:45,912
<i>When I see</i>

374
00:26:46,467 --> 00:26:47,969
<i>A beautiful girl</i>

375
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,677
<i>I get excited</i>

376
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,104
<i>Basically basically basically</i>

377
00:26:54,933 --> 00:26:56,105
<i>I</i> 'm a rascal

378
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,405
<i>But you're no less baby</i>

379
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,108
<i>Somedays youTe nice</i>

380
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:05,903
<i>Somedays youTe crooked</i>

381
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,642
<i>Basically basically basically.</i> ..

382
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:12,045
You're a rascal too

383
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:40,447
Koko, why don't you think
seriously about Raghuvendra?

384
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,845
He is so right for you...

385
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,939
This is why some
people should not drink

386
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:49,910
Why should she think
about Raghuvendra?

387
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:51,742
Is he the last man in the world?

388
00:27:51,867 --> 00:27:54,006
Why shouldn't she consider him?

389
00:27:54,467 --> 00:28:01,544
I will tell you point by point why
Raghuvendra is the perfect guy for Koko

390
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,507
Point no. 1...

391
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,476
And this is the most
important point in the world

392
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:10,406
He is good looking

393
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:15,974
Hardly two percent of people
in the world look good...

394
00:28:16,367 --> 00:28:18,711
and if you have to spend
your life with somebody...

395
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,942
every morning you should
at least see a handsome face

396
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,940
Point no. 2...

397
00:28:25,634 --> 00:28:27,875
He has a great sense of humour...

398
00:28:28,634 --> 00:28:32,548
and more laughter means more sex

399
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,604
Where are you getting
this information?

400
00:28:36,267 --> 00:28:37,940
Point no. 3...

401
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:42,342
He understands your profession

402
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:47,710
If you marry a software
engineer or a farmer...

403
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,871
what will you discuss at dinner?

404
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:52,311
Virus or cow dung?

405
00:28:52,367 --> 00:28:54,347
Hello, my husband
is a software engineer

406
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,504
And we have many
interesting discussions

407
00:28:57,567 --> 00:28:58,272
Like what?

408
00:28:58,433 --> 00:28:59,844
Like a lot of things

409
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,380
And I'm sure farmers
are interesting too...

410
00:29:02,434 --> 00:29:04,778
they can tell us
about organic vegetables

411
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:07,575
They can tell you
where to get cow's milk

412
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,402
Go, marry a farmer

413
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:12,776
Ganju, tell them I'm right

414
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:15,814
Yes, please give us
your male point of view

415
00:29:15,867 --> 00:29:18,575
Guys, just shut up

416
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:20,271
This is all pointless

417
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:25,544
He's going to meet his
ex-girlfriend in New York

418
00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:29,681
E><-girlfriend! That's just great

419
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:33,906
Ex is an ex, that's in the past

420
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,837
Just punch her

421
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,507
No, the important question is...

422
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:42,875
are you his present?

423
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,473
William Faulkner once said...

424
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:50,540
""The past is never dead,
in fact it's not even the past""

425
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,905
What?

426
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,301
<i>Your 'BU taught you âis?</i>

427
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:57,904
Hey I want to go to this 'BD'

428
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:26,403
<i>Raguu!</i>

429
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,608
Take it take it...

430
00:30:29,567 --> 00:30:32,309
No I don't need it

431
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:35,678
<i>Stop acting pricey...
1 know you like Raguu</i>

432
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,974
No, I don't

433
00:30:38,567 --> 00:30:43,983
Take it, keep it, very tasty so yum

434
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:46,474
Yuck Jackie, so cheap

435
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:49,737
<i>I love the taste of Raguu</i>

436
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:51,844
Have you gone mad?

437
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,511
Limited offer, grab now

438
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,311
You've gone mad

439
00:31:06,133 --> 00:31:07,373
Pasta!

440
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,239
<i>No don 'I be so desperate,
let him call</i>

441
00:31:31,434 --> 00:31:33,607
New photo?

442
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:36,871
Yes, nice?

443
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:41,376
Eat quickly, it will get cold

444
00:31:43,733 --> 00:31:46,373
<i>Raguu Raguu Raguu.</i> ..

445
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:50,313
Just crush the blacks

446
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,311
More...

447
00:31:54,867 --> 00:31:55,868
See...

448
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:03,539
Let's Play

449
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:07,305
Much better see...

450
00:32:07,367 --> 00:32:08,573
Yes, it's looking nice

451
00:32:08,733 --> 00:32:11,304
Okay now pause and zoom in

452
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:15,506
Ganju! I told you to remind me at 3 PM

453
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:18,104
I had to take Fatty to the doctor

454
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:22,180
Fatty! I'm so sorry, I'm just leaving

455
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:26,478
<i>No, you wait I'm coming there,
to eat the canteen Veda Pav</i>

456
00:32:26,533 --> 00:32:28,535
My doctor's appointment got cancelled

457
00:32:33,634 --> 00:32:35,341
This landlord...

458
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:37,271
Hello...

459
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,077
What?

460
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:44,608
You are not going to believe this

461
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,512
Being single is now a crime!

462
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:49,438
What?

463
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,107
My landlord is kicking
me out of my apartment!

464
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:53,845
What?

465
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,081
I'm going to join the
ranks of homeless in Mumbai

466
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,811
And you want to know why?

467
00:32:59,067 --> 00:33:00,512
Did I damage the apartment? No!

468
00:33:00,567 --> 00:33:02,444
Did I forget to pay rent? No!

469
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,242
The building committee
just got together and decided...

470
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,143
that only married couples
and families can live there

471
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,372
Is that even legal?

472
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:10,138
This just happened?

473
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,146
Yes he just called!

474
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,407
I've been avoiding his calls for days

475
00:33:14,467 --> 00:33:17,311
Gosh Fatty, I have to vacate
by the end of the month...

476
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:18,243
I don't know what to do

477
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,007
Damn these people

478
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:24,047
Mumbai, India's most
modern cosmopolitan city

479
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,440
Seriously

480
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:29,448
Listen, you know you can stay with me

481
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:32,377
That's not the point

482
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:36,303
In a way, thank God...

483
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:41,239
thank God I'm leaving this city
and this country for this project...

484
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,241
But seriously what thinking

485
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,247
No marriage means no home for women?

486
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:51,713
Why don't they make this lavv instead 'no
staying with your in-laws after marriage'?

487
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,204
Forget it

488
00:33:58,167 --> 00:34:02,138
So, when is the New York shoot?

489
00:34:02,433 --> 00:34:03,537
I don't know

490
00:34:03,633 --> 00:34:06,546
I will know the exact
dates in a month...

491
00:34:06,967 --> 00:34:08,537
when the man returns

492
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:10,271
The man has not called?

493
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:13,047
Raghuvendra has not called?

494
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:14,402
<i>No</i>

495
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:21,009
What 'hmm'?

496
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,944
Why you looking so suspicious?

497
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,602
Fatty? Tell me

498
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,543
He got engaged

499
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,604
He got engaged!

500
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,306
I'm sorry, who got engaged?

501
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:40,307
Raghuvendra

502
00:34:41,067 --> 00:34:42,205
When?

503
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,202
Last week

504
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,674
Last week?

505
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,470
L-le was just here,
I mean, he just left...

506
00:34:50,533 --> 00:34:51,477
I know...

507
00:34:51,534 --> 00:34:54,014
Who told you? Hovv do you know?

508
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,273
Ajay, that guy from production...

509
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:59,505
Just one second...
he's not even messaged...

510
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,204
Who told you?

511
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:04,339
Ajay, from production,
he went to New York with Raghuvendra

512
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,277
He got engaged?

513
00:35:07,934 --> 00:35:10,210
I don't believe this to whom?

514
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,507
Just please, one second, how can he'?

515
00:35:13,434 --> 00:35:14,276
Koko...

516
00:35:14,334 --> 00:35:16,575
God! This is just getting worse

517
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:39,002
You okay?

518
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,970
It's just the chilli

519
00:35:47,867 --> 00:35:49,904
You want to know to whom?

520
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:54,877
<i>No</i>

521
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,377
Okay playback

522
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,004
Sorry it slipped

523
00:36:47,967 --> 00:36:50,243
<i>Where do I go from here</i>

524
00:36:50,933 --> 00:36:53,209
<i>Where do I hide</i>

525
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,107
<i>This half heart</i>

526
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,144
How do <i>I</i> share?

527
00:36:59,734 --> 00:37:02,112
<i>We parted from myself</i>

528
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:05,038
<i>Pm separated from myself</i>

529
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:08,007
<i>This half heart</i>

530
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,803
<i>How do I settle?</i>

531
00:37:11,267 --> 00:37:13,474
<i>Oh hurting heart</i>

532
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:20,171
<i>Oh Dying heart</i>

533
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:26,139
<i>Oh broken heart</i>

534
00:37:28,934 --> 00:37:31,141
<i>What's your problem</i>

535
00:37:31,967 --> 00:37:34,243
<i>Oh heart, just go to heâ</i>

536
00:37:37,367 --> 00:37:41,509
<i>Just go to heâ, Oh heart</i>

537
00:37:56,967 --> 00:38:01,438
<i>Just go to heâ, Oh heart</i>

538
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,074
I don't believe this

539
00:38:04,134 --> 00:38:07,013
Back to Goa, back to square one

540
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,211
It's just for 1 month...

541
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:12,348
then the New York shoot will start...

542
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,405
won't it?

543
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,040
I don't know...

544
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,281
Personal and professional...

545
00:38:19,334 --> 00:38:22,713
always keep it separate

546
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,278
You always say this

547
00:38:24,334 --> 00:38:26,143
When will you ever use this?

548
00:38:26,933 --> 00:38:28,879
Such strange things you buy

549
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:31,244
Damn, I have to live
with my parents for a month

550
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,007
l-low am I going to do it'?

551
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:34,835
Stay with me...

552
00:38:34,967 --> 00:38:36,412
I'm also going to be in Goa

553
00:38:36,834 --> 00:38:38,108
We'll do yoga together

554
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:41,205
Do yoga in your fancy holiday house...

555
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,213
I wish my parents would
buy me a villa in Goa

556
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,804
Guess what?

557
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:51,347
When I reach Goa, I have
to do a beautiful shoot for my dad

558
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:54,040
Uncle also joined the film business?

559
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,374
No Jackie...

560
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:58,903
he wants me to shoot a promotional
video for his friend's restaurant...

561
00:38:58,967 --> 00:38:59,843
Who knows?

562
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,240
This could be the
turning point in my life

563
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:14,678
<i>Are you my fault</i>

564
00:39:14,733 --> 00:39:17,111
<i>Or your own mistake</i>

565
00:39:17,867 --> 00:39:20,108
<i>Shamed heart</i>

566
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:23,610
<i>Please tell me so</i>

567
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,178
<i>What do we gain now</i>

568
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,213
<i>What do we lose now</i>

569
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,146
<i>Shamed heart</i>

570
00:39:32,634 --> 00:39:35,240
<i>Crying is no use</i>

571
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,247
<i>Oh hurting heart</i>

572
00:39:41,134 --> 00:39:47,107
<i>Oh Dying heart</i>

573
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:52,674
<i>Oh broken heart</i>

574
00:39:52,734 --> 00:39:55,715
<i>What's your problem</i>

575
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:59,340
<i>Oh heart, just go to heâ</i>

576
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:01,679
So Koko

577
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,609
Have you met 'Salman Khan' yet?

578
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:05,710
Oh my God, 'Sallu'!

579
00:40:05,867 --> 00:40:08,746
Is he so handsome in real life?

580
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,244
Does he actually have a 6 pack?

581
00:40:11,767 --> 00:40:13,769
Or is that just how
it looks on screen'?

582
00:40:14,067 --> 00:40:16,638
Tell me Koko, I'm dying to know

583
00:40:16,934 --> 00:40:18,675
First of all,
I haven't met your 'Sallu'...

584
00:40:18,733 --> 00:40:20,041
and if I ever meet him...

585
00:40:20,134 --> 00:40:21,044
I'm not going to tell him...

586
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,741
'Take off your shirt
I want to see your 6 pack abs'

587
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,642
Exactly

588
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:29,374
Tell us about your ad with 'Dhoni'

589
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,770
One second dad

590
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,281
'Salman Khan'? Abs? Really?

591
00:40:38,067 --> 00:40:41,105
Stop bugging her...

592
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,343
talk about the main topic

593
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:51,677
Yes Ashu,
she should be doing a proper job...

594
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:53,175
in an office...

595
00:40:53,634 --> 00:40:56,114
something more respectable

596
00:40:56,667 --> 00:40:59,546
That's when we can talk to
people seriously about marriage

597
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,306
Why will she do some otherjob?

598
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,180
She's done a cinematography
course in New York

599
00:41:05,634 --> 00:41:08,114
She is brilliant at her
job and she's still young

600
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:10,010
She won't be young forever...

601
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,547
all the good boys will be taken

602
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,602
That's my biggest worry you know...

603
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,878
come baby...

604
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,278
So Kaira, tell me...

605
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:30,907
Are you a...

606
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:33,877
Are you a Lebanese?

607
00:41:37,867 --> 00:41:42,009
It's not Lebanese', it is lesbian!

608
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:48,580
Yes, are you a Lesbian'?

609
00:41:59,034 --> 00:42:00,479
Oh my God...

610
00:42:00,634 --> 00:42:04,878
If I were, would that stop
you from talking about marriage?

611
00:42:05,067 --> 00:42:08,947
Even if you are,
it won't make a difference...

612
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,671
all this gay stuff is
cool in the film industry

613
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,106
You're right...

614
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:15,670
from big stars to spot boys,
everyone's gay...

615
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,470
we call it 'Gollyvvood' now

616
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,704
Really?

617
00:42:19,067 --> 00:42:20,137
Really?

618
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,043
Of course not!

619
00:42:22,934 --> 00:42:25,471
Do you people even
listen to yourselves?

620
00:42:25,534 --> 00:42:27,138
It's such rubbish

621
00:42:27,767 --> 00:42:30,509
The film industry doesn't have more
gay people, it's just more accepting...

622
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:34,980
there must be many gay
people in your office too...

623
00:42:35,634 --> 00:42:37,978
but sadly they have to hide the fact

624
00:42:40,234 --> 00:42:44,580
So, are you?

625
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,001
A 'lesbd?

626
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,980
No, unfortunately not

627
00:42:55,034 --> 00:42:58,481
So why don't you settle down?

628
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,413
We're just worried about you Koko

629
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,440
If you keep hanging
with these filmy men...

630
00:43:04,567 --> 00:43:06,547
how will you find a nice boy'?

631
00:43:06,733 --> 00:43:11,512
Filmy men are okay for checking
out abs, but not okay to marry?

632
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,110
L-low much junk you Keep eating

633
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,480
I've made all this for you...

634
00:43:16,534 --> 00:43:17,171
eat this

635
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,947
For me? Have you
ever seen me eat this?

636
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,637
<i>I thought you like paneer...</i>

637
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,545
you used to eat it...

638
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,814
that's why I keep
asking what you want...

639
00:43:30,867 --> 00:43:32,540
anyway, dinner is put...

640
00:43:35,467 --> 00:43:37,640
come baby, come...

641
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,509
You know Koko

642
00:43:49,567 --> 00:43:53,071
getting married before 25...

643
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,045
can reduce the divorce rate by 50%

644
00:43:59,367 --> 00:44:02,075
There is a 100% chance
of not getting a divorce...

645
00:44:03,467 --> 00:44:04,946
...by not getting married

646
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,002
I'm going to stay with Jackie

647
00:44:07,967 --> 00:44:09,002
Koko?

648
00:44:16,067 --> 00:44:21,608
<i>Pm addicted to pain</i>

649
00:44:21,967 --> 00:44:26,973
<i>Even my tears, laugh at me</i>

650
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:32,573
<i>Why do I give myself new scars</i>

651
00:44:32,934 --> 00:44:39,010
<i>Somebody save me from myself</i>

652
00:44:40,067 --> 00:44:42,946
What about the New York project...

653
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,646
What is this question,
'did you sleep well'?

654
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,611
If I say no what can you do?

655
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:36,978
I don't care what people think...

656
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,514
I'm not going to stay
with you for other people...

657
00:45:40,934 --> 00:45:43,346
don't irritate me please

658
00:45:44,034 --> 00:45:46,014
'Good morning' is it?

659
00:45:48,367 --> 00:45:50,278
Now it's a 'good morning'...

660
00:45:50,867 --> 00:45:52,813
If your night is not good...

661
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,811
how will your morning be good'?

662
00:45:54,967 --> 00:45:56,776
I think I should
be a night watchman...

663
00:45:56,867 --> 00:45:59,279
Should I take an
appointment with a doctor?

664
00:46:02,434 --> 00:46:03,242
Who is that?

665
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:07,806
He moved here a few weeks ago,
to write...

666
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,501
Nice gUY

667
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,643
Take an appointment with him

668
00:46:14,967 --> 00:46:17,538
There she is, my talented daughter...

669
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,610
She shoots with all
'Bollywood' celebrities

670
00:46:20,867 --> 00:46:20,969
Really?

671
00:46:22,467 --> 00:46:23,946
I know this is a small job for you...

672
00:46:24,234 --> 00:46:27,443
but this new restaurant
video is very important for us...

673
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,808
thank you so much for doing this

674
00:46:28,867 --> 00:46:29,971
No, it's cool

675
00:46:30,267 --> 00:46:32,713
Actually we should start,
the camera setup will take a while

676
00:46:32,767 --> 00:46:35,338
Yes, she is very professional

677
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,778
During work, only work, nothing else

678
00:46:37,834 --> 00:46:38,744
Dad!

679
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:41,210
Can we stop all these
useless formalities?

680
00:46:41,267 --> 00:46:41,972
I need to get this done

681
00:46:42,234 --> 00:46:43,611
I only have a day

682
00:46:45,667 --> 00:46:47,305
Get the 24-70

683
00:46:47,367 --> 00:46:48,744
Tried everything Ganju...

684
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,542
even sleeping pills, nothing works

685
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,440
Try 'Reiki'...
my grandmother also tried it

686
00:46:56,367 --> 00:46:57,778
Shut up and setup

687
00:46:58,234 --> 00:47:00,339
Remove all this,
what's all this rubbish...

688
00:47:04,634 --> 00:47:07,240
I am sorry,
this can't be moved right now...

689
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,779
only after this session ends

690
00:47:08,834 --> 00:47:09,778
What?

691
00:47:09,867 --> 00:47:12,313
We have to wait? Then why call us?

692
00:47:12,367 --> 00:47:13,675
Ma'am, the session is going on

693
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,245
Madness!

694
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,638
National Convention for
Mental Health Awareness...

695
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,609
it's a festival for therapists...

696
00:47:20,667 --> 00:47:23,477
RaunaKs playground...should we go in?

697
00:47:23,534 --> 00:47:25,241
Shut up and sit

698
00:47:28,467 --> 00:47:29,241
Here?

699
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,301
Just sit

700
00:47:40,867 --> 00:47:43,177
I've done a shot breakdown,
you want to see?

701
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,378
I'm sleeping

702
00:47:44,434 --> 00:47:47,779
<i>Dr. Chopra,
therapy, counselling, analysis...</i>

703
00:47:47,834 --> 00:47:49,336
<i>so many big terms...</i>

704
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,471
<i>what do they actually mean?</i>

705
00:47:51,867 --> 00:47:57,476
<i>A proper map can be drawn after defining
commonly accepted medical terms...</i>

706
00:47:57,534 --> 00:48:01,448
<i>if your prob/em or illness
falls in those definitions...</i>

707
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,310
<i>your prognosis will
tell you your diagnosis</i>

708
00:48:04,433 --> 00:48:08,711
<i>it will become clear whether you need
intensive therapy or counselling...</i>

709
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,671
<i>whether you need an
analyst or psychiatrist...</i>

710
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,108
<i>it's quite simple actually</i>

711
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,406
It's very simple

712
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,276
What are they talking
hovv to understand?

713
00:48:17,334 --> 00:48:21,248
<i>Dr. Pereira, how does one decide which
type of doctor they should be going to?</i>

714
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,836
<i>A psychiatrist or</i> a <i>psychologist?</i>

715
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:25,675
<i>Each model has it's own
strengths and weaknesses.</i> ..

716
00:48:25,734 --> 00:48:29,409
<i>Ah individual may find one approach
more appropriate than another...</i>

717
00:48:29,767 --> 00:48:31,838
<i>depending on his
persona! preferences...</i>

718
00:48:32,134 --> 00:48:34,842
<i>and the depth and severity
of the problem presented</i>

719
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,280
If I hear another minute of this...

720
00:48:38,567 --> 00:48:39,443
I'll go nuts

721
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,070
<i>This question is for Dr. Khan</i>

722
00:48:41,267 --> 00:48:45,579
<i>Dr. Khan, how do you know
if someone is crazy or normal?</i>

723
00:48:46,134 --> 00:48:46,373
What?

724
00:48:46,434 --> 00:48:47,708
Take me for example...

725
00:48:47,834 --> 00:48:51,338
<i>many of you might
think that Pm crazy...</i>

726
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:56,408
<i>I've come for this formal
seminar in these torn jeans...</i>

727
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:58,605
so, am <i>I</i> crazy?

728
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:04,443
<i>Or maybe all I need is</i> a <i>good stylist</i>

729
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,312
Crazy! Very scary word

730
00:49:08,467 --> 00:49:10,640
Because here we still believe that...

731
00:49:11,434 --> 00:49:14,438
a problem of the mind
is something to be ashamed of

732
00:49:15,234 --> 00:49:17,510
If you have a problem with your body,
that's normal...

733
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,079
you can tell everyone...

734
00:49:19,534 --> 00:49:22,208
'hey I'm in hospital...

735
00:49:22,367 --> 00:49:24,347
with a kidney failure...

736
00:49:24,634 --> 00:49:26,739
lung infection, jaundice'

737
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,673
But if it's a problem of the mind...

738
00:49:29,734 --> 00:49:33,307
then the whole family goes silent...

739
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,071
hush hush hush...

740
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:44,705
as if the mind is not
even a part of the body

741
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,579
Don't laugh just yet...

742
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,037
the joke begins now

743
00:49:49,434 --> 00:49:53,541
Here in Goa,
my parents used to tell everyone...

744
00:49:53,767 --> 00:49:57,544
that I'm a gynaecologist,
not a psychologist

745
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:01,045
Which means the doctor's
own family is ashamed...

746
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,679
to admit that their son is a therapist,
dealing with problems of the mind

747
00:50:05,067 --> 00:50:06,512
Imagine my plight...

748
00:50:07,034 --> 00:50:14,475
many of my pregnant relatives landed
up at the clinic for a free check up...

749
00:50:15,234 --> 00:50:18,477
and you know what,
I delivered a few babies too...

750
00:50:18,534 --> 00:50:20,707
for the extra pocket money

751
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:23,044
No, I'm just kidding

752
00:50:29,534 --> 00:50:33,141
Dr. Jehangir Khan

753
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:10,243
Thank you

754
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,177
You'll close it please?

755
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:35,175
So I'm Jehangir Khan...

756
00:51:35,334 --> 00:51:37,974
but you can call me '.Jug'

757
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,108
May I have a glass of water...

758
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:42,579
from that jug, Jug?

759
00:51:45,067 --> 00:51:47,980
<i>I'm sure you can
crack better yokes Kama</i>

760
00:51:49,667 --> 00:51:51,613
May I call you Kaira?

761
00:51:51,667 --> 00:51:53,669
I have only one name

762
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:02,112
So, how does this work'?

763
00:52:04,067 --> 00:52:06,547
I have no idea how that works...

764
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,273
you tell me

765
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,637
Can I lie down here?

766
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:13,537
Why, are you sleepy?

767
00:52:13,867 --> 00:52:16,143
I'm not able to sleep

768
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,208
That's the reason I am here

769
00:52:19,967 --> 00:52:21,446
Did you see a doctor?

770
00:52:21,534 --> 00:52:23,070
Isn't that what I'm doing?

771
00:52:24,167 --> 00:52:27,876
You mean the white coat,
stethescope, pill-giving doctors...

772
00:52:27,934 --> 00:52:30,312
I tried pills, they didn't work

773
00:52:30,367 --> 00:52:31,937
That's why I'm here

774
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,245
Sometimes I use this to
knock my patients off to sleep

775
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,943
You're funny

776
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,276
But, you need to work on your jokes

777
00:52:44,034 --> 00:52:45,308
So tell me

778
00:52:46,367 --> 00:52:50,975
Any major change in your life?

779
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,107
I just moved from Mumbai to Goa...

780
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,145
is that a major change?

781
00:52:56,233 --> 00:52:58,406
Yes that's a major change...and?

782
00:52:59,233 --> 00:53:03,943
And nothing,
the moving out, the settling in...

783
00:53:04,167 --> 00:53:07,546
Or the leaving, the unsettling?

784
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,212
No, that's not a problem for me...

785
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,210
I like to move,
not being in one place...

786
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,903
in fact I love to travel...

787
00:53:15,967 --> 00:53:18,140
it's just this sleeping problem

788
00:53:18,967 --> 00:53:23,074
So why did you move
from Mumbai to Goa'?

789
00:53:29,867 --> 00:53:31,210
You know...

790
00:53:33,034 --> 00:53:38,108
I came to Goa to be
with my best friend...

791
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,403
she's having issues with this guy...

792
00:53:41,467 --> 00:53:47,816
who she really likes,
really 'lil<ecl'...

793
00:53:47,867 --> 00:53:52,373
and she thought he liked her too...

794
00:53:52,434 --> 00:53:55,074
but then he suddenly
got engaged to someone else

795
00:53:55,267 --> 00:53:58,908
So your best friend, is she okay now?

796
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,311
I don't think so...

797
00:54:02,734 --> 00:54:03,940
I don't think she is okay

798
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,239
I think her main problem
is her profession

799
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:11,907
She got this dream job,
which is linked to him...

800
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:15,107
his new fiance will
also be on this project

801
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,737
So how will she handle that'?

802
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,311
I don't know

803
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:20,877
What if everything gets messed up?

804
00:54:20,933 --> 00:54:23,743
I don't know what to advise her...

805
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,007
should she just deal with it?

806
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,246
It is her dream job after all

807
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,109
Sometimes I feel I should tell her -

808
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,043
'Grit your teeth and just do it...

809
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:35,240
you won't get another
opportunity like this'

810
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,902
And sometimes I feel I should say -

811
00:54:36,967 --> 00:54:38,275
'Shut up! And say no!...

812
00:54:38,433 --> 00:54:39,878
don't you have self respect?'

813
00:54:39,933 --> 00:54:43,745
So I don't know what to tell her

814
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:49,145
So you are not able to sleep,
because you are up all night...

815
00:54:49,234 --> 00:54:54,980
wondering whether to tell
your best friend to shut up or not?

816
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,438
My grandfather used
to tell me a story...

817
00:55:01,134 --> 00:55:04,707
please narrate it to your best friend

818
00:55:05,667 --> 00:55:08,841
My grandfather was a mountain-climber

819
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:13,940
Before any expedition,
he would be thoroughly prepared

820
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,280
<i>Sad/y, poor Pyare/a/ji
was not like this</i>

821
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:21,212
<i>Who Pyareiaiji?</i>

822
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:25,007
A very old friend of my grandfathers'

823
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:26,971
He was also a
mountain-climbing enthusiast...

824
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:31,171
whose life-long desire
was to climb the toughest peak...

825
00:55:31,434 --> 00:55:33,209
Mt. Everest!

826
00:55:34,767 --> 00:55:37,407
<i>Finally one day, Pyare/a/ji
got the chance to climb Mt. Everest...</i>

827
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:40,113
with a Chinese trekking
expedition group

828
00:55:40,334 --> 00:55:45,875
Without thought or preparation,
he said yes and left

829
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:48,038
But the group was Chinese...

830
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,305
so they could speak only
in their own language...

831
00:55:50,367 --> 00:55:52,210
no English Vinglish

832
00:55:53,167 --> 00:55:55,807
So the trek began

833
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,177
As they slowly and
steadily climbed higher...

834
00:56:00,634 --> 00:56:07,609
<i>PyareÂ§aÂ§ji paced ahead of
the group with much enthusiasm...</i>

835
00:56:08,033 --> 00:56:10,707
while the Chinese people kept waving
from behind and shouting in Chinese...

836
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:14,180
<i>'Don't go ahead! hatahau hatahau/L.</i>

837
00:56:14,233 --> 00:56:18,204
<i>but Pyare/a/ji thought
they were cheering him</i> oh...

838
00:56:18,267 --> 00:56:21,908
and saying 'go ahead,

839
00:56:22,267 --> 00:56:23,712
You can speak Chinese?

840
00:56:24,067 --> 00:56:24,909
Can you?

841
00:56:24,967 --> 00:56:25,672
<i>No</i>

842
00:56:25,733 --> 00:56:26,939
Then this works

843
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,172
Don't laugh, listen

844
00:56:28,367 --> 00:56:33,612
<i>Sudden/y, Pyare/a/ji saw</i> a <i>growling
snow leopard in front of him...</i>

845
00:56:33,667 --> 00:56:37,615
<i>PyareÂ§aÂ§ got screâ""
1 mean he got bloody scared</i>

846
00:56:37,667 --> 00:56:39,977
Now he started waving his hands
frantically and shouting 'Help, Help!'

847
00:56:40,033 --> 00:56:44,743
But the Chinese people
thought he is just happy

848
00:56:44,967 --> 00:56:49,712
So he kept crying for help,
and they kept waving back

849
00:56:50,767 --> 00:56:51,939
Then?

850
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,773
<i>Then the snow leopard
ate up poor Pyare/a/ji</i>

851
00:56:55,934 --> 00:56:56,275
What?

852
00:56:56,334 --> 00:56:57,108
Yes he was hungry

853
00:56:57,234 --> 00:56:59,236
You don't find many
people on Mt. Everest...

854
00:56:59,567 --> 00:57:00,773
And the group kept shouting...

855
00:57:00,867 --> 00:57:02,778
'don't go ahead'

856
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:06,144
What a strange story

857
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,204
No, it's not a strange story

858
00:57:09,667 --> 00:57:11,806
Please tell your friend...

859
00:57:11,867 --> 00:57:16,043
that sometimes we choose
the tough path only because...

860
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,110
we feel that to achieve
important things...

861
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,578
we have to take the tough path

862
00:57:22,767 --> 00:57:26,613
We feel we need to punish ourselves...

863
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,538
but why?

864
00:57:31,067 --> 00:57:32,910
Why not choose the easy way out?

865
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,809
What is so bad about it?

866
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:40,912
Especially when we are
unprepared for the tough path

867
00:57:44,233 --> 00:57:46,110
Why climb mountains
when you are not ready to?

868
00:57:46,567 --> 00:57:47,705
Excuse me

869
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,912
You will tell your
friend the story right?

870
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,976
It's important

871
00:58:05,667 --> 00:58:08,546
Okay, I think...

872
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:11,205
My sleeping problem began...

873
00:58:11,467 --> 00:58:15,142
when Raghuvendra got engaged

874
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,107
Raghuvendra?

875
00:58:17,567 --> 00:58:18,477
The guy in my story?

876
00:58:18,534 --> 00:58:21,140
Right, your friend's...

877
00:58:21,767 --> 00:58:24,543
No, mine

878
00:58:25,567 --> 00:58:28,878
At least I thought he was mine

879
00:58:34,767 --> 00:58:37,111
We used to work together

880
00:58:40,867 --> 00:58:42,039
Jack!

881
00:58:48,134 --> 00:58:49,545
What are you doing here?

882
00:58:50,167 --> 00:58:51,737
What are you doing here?

883
00:58:53,067 --> 00:58:56,776
You don't answer my calls,
you moved here without telling me

884
00:58:56,834 --> 00:58:57,938
Without telling you

885
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,704
Why would I tell you?

886
00:59:00,567 --> 00:59:01,671
Who are you?

887
00:59:02,767 --> 00:59:04,713
Actually I have one
thing to tell you...

888
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:07,102
I've made my decision

889
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,837
What decision?

890
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,708
Kaira, I have to talk to you...

891
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,802
Just shut up, one second

892
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,043
Listen to this story

893
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,912
This man wants to climb Mt. Everest...

894
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,106
but without any preparation
he leaves for Mt. Everest...

895
00:59:24,534 --> 00:59:25,911
with Chinese companions...

896
00:59:26,067 --> 00:59:27,808
and as he's about to fall...

897
00:59:27,867 --> 00:59:30,575
the Chinese people don't understand...

898
00:59:30,634 --> 00:59:31,806
obviously, because they are Chinese...

899
00:59:31,867 --> 00:59:33,403
and they keep waving their flag...

900
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,478
and the man is stuck...

901
00:59:34,533 --> 00:59:36,137
and then a tiger eats him up!

902
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,772
Got it?

903
00:59:45,467 --> 00:59:47,947
The difficult option
is not the only option

904
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,880
We can choose the easy option
also because the easy option is easy

905
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,107
You know, forget it

906
00:59:58,167 --> 00:59:59,942
It's too much for your small mind

907
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,809
It's a very deep thought

908
01:00:02,667 --> 01:00:05,671
Are you talking about
working on the film?

909
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,707
I was talking about
NOT working on the film!

910
01:00:08,834 --> 01:00:10,177
That's my decision

911
01:00:10,534 --> 01:00:12,810
Okay, okay good

912
01:00:12,933 --> 01:00:14,139
Good?

913
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,571
Yes I think that's the best...

914
01:00:16,634 --> 01:00:17,908
You think?

915
01:00:18,634 --> 01:00:19,704
Did you hear that?

916
01:00:19,767 --> 01:00:20,905
You think?

917
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:26,779
I have already taken the
decision to not work on your film...

918
01:00:26,834 --> 01:00:28,905
What do you mean by 'you think'?

919
01:00:31,067 --> 01:00:34,844
I guess someone really
does need therapy...

920
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:36,970
You told him?

921
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:37,875
No Koko

922
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:38,776
Him?

923
01:00:38,834 --> 01:00:40,939
Yes, she told me, so?

924
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,041
And anyway why do you need therapy?

925
01:00:44,167 --> 01:00:47,705
What's the big tragedy in your life?

926
01:00:48,034 --> 01:00:50,640
You didn't want to get serious,
didn't want to commit

927
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:53,476
So I don't understand,
what is the problem?

928
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,908
You don't understand?
- No!

929
01:00:54,967 --> 01:00:56,037
Then get out

930
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,879
Oh God Kaira...

931
01:00:59,867 --> 01:01:01,904
You really need to grow up

932
01:01:05,567 --> 01:01:11,813
Good thing you've decided
not to work on my film...

933
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,677
I'm looking for mature
people to work with

934
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:17,870
What did I just say?

935
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,810
Get out right? Get out!

936
01:01:25,867 --> 01:01:27,676
Bye, see you Jackie

937
01:01:27,734 --> 01:01:30,010
I'm not mature enough to
handle your big fat project...

938
01:01:30,067 --> 01:01:32,479
but mature enough to sleep with you?

939
01:01:32,534 --> 01:01:34,571
Amazing! What a revelation

940
01:01:34,633 --> 01:01:35,907
Kaira I came here to...

941
01:01:36,367 --> 01:01:38,608
I don't want to do this, get out

942
01:01:38,667 --> 01:01:40,442
What are you doing Kaira?

943
01:01:40,734 --> 01:01:41,769
Just get out!

944
01:01:50,867 --> 01:01:53,040
Koko, are you sure about this?

945
01:01:54,567 --> 01:01:56,376
I know with all these
personal issues...

946
01:01:56,434 --> 01:01:58,812
working with Raghu will be tough...

947
01:01:59,467 --> 01:02:01,777
but this was your big break

948
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,606
Okay Jack

949
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:10,313
Sometimes we choose
a tough path just because...

950
01:02:10,367 --> 01:02:12,973
we believe that to
achieve important things...

951
01:02:13,334 --> 01:02:16,338
we have to choose the tough option

952
01:02:16,767 --> 01:02:21,944
But sometimes you need
to choose the easier option...

953
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:28,040
because at that time that
is the best option for you

954
01:02:29,434 --> 01:02:30,412
Right?

955
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:35,874
Especially when you are
not ready to face that tough path

956
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,938
Damn! Wish I had said
it right when he was here

957
01:02:49,634 --> 01:02:51,409
You want some tea?

958
01:03:03,667 --> 01:03:06,648
Tonight I'm going to sleep so well,
so <i>well...</i>

959
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,440
Very well!

960
01:04:36,534 --> 01:04:39,481
I was at this construction site...

961
01:04:39,534 --> 01:04:41,912
with all these construction workers...

962
01:04:42,167 --> 01:04:45,171
all short and strange people

963
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:48,639
Suddenly, I lose my balance...

964
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:51,806
and I go falling down...

965
01:04:51,867 --> 01:04:54,370
this big fall...

966
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,840
and land in muck

967
01:04:57,267 --> 01:05:00,077
I think it was a gutter

968
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:07,113
All these workers are just staring,
but no one is helping...

969
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,375
I look up...

970
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,576
and I see my camera dangling...

971
01:05:13,334 --> 01:05:16,577
and then suddenly out of nowhere...

972
01:05:16,734 --> 01:05:19,772
this group of newly married women...

973
01:05:19,834 --> 01:05:25,409
<i>in saris, pal/us & bind/s
all land up there...</i>

974
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:31,273
and they start pointing
at me, laughing at me

975
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,804
Bam! I woke up

976
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,410
It was 4 am...

977
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:41,277
I went straight to the bathroom
and stood under the shower

978
01:05:41,467 --> 01:05:42,844
Why shower?

979
01:05:44,433 --> 01:05:45,468
I don't know

980
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:51,775
I felt dirty, I felt
like I needed to clean up

981
01:05:52,267 --> 01:05:55,680
So this Raghuvendra,
he is tall and handsome?

982
01:05:56,367 --> 01:05:58,278
That's your conclusion of my dream?

983
01:05:58,334 --> 01:06:00,007
Just asking

984
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:05,738
You know what I felt...

985
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:13,748
I felt I am ugly, trashy, cheap, dirty

986
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:14,671
That's funny

987
01:06:15,067 --> 01:06:16,239
What's funny?

988
01:06:16,667 --> 01:06:18,340
I mean...

989
01:06:19,267 --> 01:06:25,377
all this from a girl who is
the opposite of ugly, trashy or dirty

990
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:30,171
That's funny... not ""ha-ha"" funny

991
01:06:31,134 --> 01:06:32,477
<i>0K6'!</i>

992
01:06:34,267 --> 01:06:35,371
Oops!

993
01:06:35,767 --> 01:06:37,178
What's With this?

994
01:06:37,534 --> 01:06:43,416
It only creaks when you really like
someone, but can't do anything about it

995
01:06:49,034 --> 01:06:53,346
Yes, Raghuvendra is tall and handsome

996
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:59,314
So you like tall people,
not short and strange

997
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,947
Maybe...Sid was also tall

998
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,502
So there's a Sid too?

999
01:07:04,567 --> 01:07:06,137
Yes so?

1000
01:07:06,934 --> 01:07:10,381
So I mean you're a young
and beautiful woman...

1001
01:07:10,467 --> 01:07:11,377
you will have admirers

1002
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:12,701
What do you mean?

1003
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,308
What do you mean by admirers?

1004
01:07:14,467 --> 01:07:16,504
I mean you're a young
and beautiful woman...

1005
01:07:16,567 --> 01:07:17,477
you will have admirers

1006
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:18,512
Admirers?
- Yes

1007
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:20,069
You're trying to say
that there are lots of men!

1008
01:07:20,134 --> 01:07:21,272
That's what you're trying to say

1009
01:07:21,334 --> 01:07:23,075
No, what do you want me to say?

1010
01:07:23,267 --> 01:07:24,337
Why would I say that? No

1011
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,470
That's what you are saying

1012
01:07:25,534 --> 01:07:30,142
You actually mean that I'm a fast girl, a cheap girl...
- No come on!

1013
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,508
Fast dirty cheap...

1014
01:07:31,567 --> 01:07:34,411
...why use these words?

1015
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:36,174
Isn't that what the world thinks?

1016
01:07:37,334 --> 01:07:40,611
If a girl has more than
one relationship then that's it!

1017
01:08:06,567 --> 01:08:08,137
Kaira...

1018
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:11,073
have you ever bought a chair?

1019
01:08:11,433 --> 01:08:12,036
What?

1020
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:14,410
<i>A chair, kursi
have you ever bought one?</i>

1021
01:08:14,967 --> 01:08:16,071
Yes

1022
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:20,012
And did you just go into a
shop and buy the first chair you saw?

1023
01:08:21,233 --> 01:08:22,234
<i>No</i>

1024
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:23,608
Exactly my point

1025
01:08:23,867 --> 01:08:28,077
We look at so many different
chairs until we find the right one

1026
01:08:29,367 --> 01:08:32,348
Some chairs may be comfortable
but look like shit...

1027
01:08:32,467 --> 01:08:34,947
others look nice but
are hard on the butt...

1028
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,006
So the process starts,
chair after chair...

1029
01:08:40,067 --> 01:08:42,547
how many chairs we
check out before we find...

1030
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,604
that one chair!

1031
01:08:49,934 --> 01:08:51,572
It doesn't creak with me

1032
01:08:53,534 --> 01:08:58,540
If we look for so many
options just to buy a chair...

1033
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,007
then shouldn't we look at options...

1034
01:09:01,367 --> 01:09:03,347
when choosing a life partner?

1035
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,108
So...dirty cheap fast...no

1036
01:09:08,134 --> 01:09:12,241
Smart clear fine...actually superfine!

1037
01:09:13,034 --> 01:09:14,980
Wait wait wait

1038
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:19,046
So the women in my
dream who believe that...

1039
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:23,105
marriage is the only
acceptable relationship...

1040
01:09:23,234 --> 01:09:26,215
I felt dirty because of them

1041
01:09:26,267 --> 01:09:31,148
See? You figured it out yourself...
you don't need anyone's help

1042
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:35,942
But the dangling camera?
What does that mean?

1043
01:09:36,333 --> 01:09:40,110
Just like my future,
it's hanging in the air

1044
01:09:40,567 --> 01:09:43,275
Maybe you should sit on my chair...

1045
01:09:43,334 --> 01:09:46,941
and I should sit here from today

1046
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,104
It's so cool

1047
01:09:50,267 --> 01:09:55,979
I wish the whole world could
hear about your chair theory

1048
01:09:56,300 --> 01:10:01,579
Why is it important for
the whole world to hear this?

1049
01:10:02,034 --> 01:10:03,479
No I just...

1050
01:10:03,934 --> 01:10:08,405
if they understand this chair theory
they will stop judging others...

1051
01:10:08,467 --> 01:10:10,913
and what a beautiful world it will be

1052
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,135
No Kaira...

1053
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,842
when you understand yourself <i>well...</i>

1054
01:10:16,067 --> 01:10:19,207
then what others think
of you doesn't matter

1055
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:28,907
If you don't take charge
of your own life somebody else will

1056
01:10:31,067 --> 01:10:35,516
I pity those who don't shop for chairs

1057
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:42,009
Kaira, will you go
back to your chair please?

1058
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,446
Looked like you wanted
to take my chair home with you

1059
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:50,449
And speaking of home,
I have homework for you

1060
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:51,210
Homework?

1061
01:10:51,267 --> 01:10:53,440
Yes I'm very strict
with my homework assignments

1062
01:10:53,501 --> 01:10:54,275
<i>0K6'!</i>

1063
01:10:54,401 --> 01:10:56,813
I want you to chat
with your mom and dad

1064
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,077
1O minutes with each please

1065
01:10:59,134 --> 01:11:00,943
Please, what will I say to them?

1066
01:11:01,134 --> 01:11:02,340
Time's up, see you next week

1067
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,971
What! We have 2O seconds more

1068
01:11:06,267 --> 01:11:10,340
Hey you saw that?

1069
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,072
What happened?

1070
01:11:13,267 --> 01:11:14,405
2O seconds happened

1071
01:11:17,134 --> 01:11:19,740
I don't like this buzzer

1072
01:11:20,367 --> 01:11:21,846
Homework Kaira

1073
01:11:24,034 --> 01:11:27,481
Hey, those are really
nice looking glasses...

1074
01:11:27,967 --> 01:11:28,968
Thanks

1075
01:11:29,434 --> 01:11:32,381
You're going to see Jug?

1076
01:11:32,434 --> 01:11:35,005
Yup, I have an appointment

1077
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:36,441
Really?

1078
01:11:36,734 --> 01:11:38,042
You have problems too?

1079
01:11:38,134 --> 01:11:39,169
YUP

1080
01:11:40,067 --> 01:11:42,274
I am going to get my cycle repaired

1081
01:11:44,334 --> 01:11:46,314
Repairs cycles too?

1082
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,276
Hi dad

1083
01:11:49,334 --> 01:11:51,314
Hi darling, when will you come home?

1084
01:11:51,367 --> 01:11:52,277
I'll come

1085
01:11:52,334 --> 01:11:55,178
You will be home before
Kiddo arrives right?

1086
01:11:55,467 --> 01:11:58,038
There's enough time for that,
of course I'll be there

1087
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:00,011
Your mom is in high spirits...

1088
01:12:00,067 --> 01:12:02,013
full planning for the party

1089
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:05,276
Obviously, her prince is arriving

1090
01:12:05,334 --> 01:12:09,783
Those restaurant guys
loved your film...

1091
01:12:09,834 --> 01:12:11,871
They said it was very well shot

1092
01:12:12,067 --> 01:12:13,375
Oh the hotel video

1093
01:12:13,767 --> 01:12:15,337
<i>Close up of Prawn Ba/chao?</i>

1094
01:12:16,234 --> 01:12:18,236
Anyway I'll call later

1095
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,404
<i>0K6'!</i>

1096
01:12:19,767 --> 01:12:20,905
Bye

1097
01:12:23,434 --> 01:12:25,072
4 minutes!

1098
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,338
Yes Koko, you called?

1099
01:12:30,401 --> 01:12:32,881
Yes, why didn't you pick up
- I was cleaning Kiddds room...

1100
01:12:34,967 --> 01:12:36,412
I didn't have my phone

1101
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:38,977
Okay but I'm busy now,
can't talk bye

1102
01:12:39,134 --> 01:12:40,238
<i>0K6'!</i>

1103
01:12:41,134 --> 01:12:42,704
Shift that!

1104
01:12:43,867 --> 01:12:46,814
'Talk to mom and dad
for 1O minutes'...is he mad!

1105
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,937
Beach?

1106
01:13:11,034 --> 01:13:13,344
Are we having the session out here?

1107
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,746
Why not? Problem?

1108
01:13:16,067 --> 01:13:18,911
No, but is it allowed?

1109
01:13:20,067 --> 01:13:21,876
Whose permission do I need?

1110
01:13:22,234 --> 01:13:25,147
I don't know,
but aren't there some rules?

1111
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:28,975
Like privacy,
closed door, couch and all that?

1112
01:13:29,234 --> 01:13:30,372
There are rules

1113
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:35,206
But one should know which
ones to break and which ones to not

1114
01:13:36,367 --> 01:13:39,780
Now people will know I am crazy

1115
01:13:39,834 --> 01:13:44,078
Who are these people
who keep following you?

1116
01:13:50,234 --> 01:13:56,048
Despite the mess, Goa is
the most beautiful place in India

1117
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:59,005
I wish I could agree

1118
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:01,671
Why? You don't like Goa?

1119
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:04,602
I was born here

1120
01:14:04,767 --> 01:14:09,614
This is where my parents live,
how can I like it'?

1121
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,546
Did your homework?

1122
01:14:14,067 --> 01:14:15,239
Only half...

1123
01:14:15,834 --> 01:14:17,780
I managed to talk
to dad for 5 minutes...

1124
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:21,704
okay 4 minutes,
but that's a record in itself

1125
01:14:21,767 --> 01:14:24,145
And your mom?

1126
01:14:24,934 --> 01:14:27,210
I tried, but she was busy

1127
01:14:28,234 --> 01:14:30,145
So you've only done a quarter

1128
01:14:30,234 --> 01:14:32,942
What did you chat with your dad?

1129
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,237
About Kiddo, my brother...

1130
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,939
he's studying at
the London University...

1131
01:14:39,034 --> 01:14:43,244
he's coming home soon, so
my parents are hosting a big party...

1132
01:14:43,301 --> 01:14:44,837
for his homecoming

1133
01:14:45,267 --> 01:14:49,113
When I got here nobody
even said 'welcome'

1134
01:14:50,267 --> 01:14:51,905
So you don't like Kiddo?

1135
01:14:51,967 --> 01:14:56,541
No no I love Kiddo, I really do

1136
01:14:56,901 --> 01:15:00,007
He's the only one
who can make me smile...

1137
01:15:00,134 --> 01:15:01,875
just by being there

1138
01:15:05,967 --> 01:15:10,143
When he was little,
I would read him his favorite comic...

1139
01:15:10,567 --> 01:15:13,173
<i>you know Tinkle, have you read it?</i>

1140
01:15:13,567 --> 01:15:14,102
Yes

1141
01:15:14,167 --> 01:15:19,674
<i>Hunter Shambhu,
Kaafia the Crow & Supands'...</i>

1142
01:15:19,967 --> 01:15:22,743
<i>So Supandi! was Kiddds favourite...</i>

1143
01:15:22,934 --> 01:15:26,939
So <i>I would rep/ace Supandfs
with Kiddds name...</i>

1144
01:15:27,534 --> 01:15:28,604
and read it to him

1145
01:15:29,601 --> 01:15:32,582
He loved hearing the story in my voice

1146
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:36,204
Even today, he says it's
his best childhood memory

1147
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,910
And your best childhood memory?

1148
01:15:44,034 --> 01:15:46,810
Come on, there must be something...

1149
01:15:48,967 --> 01:15:50,969
I don't know

1150
01:15:52,801 --> 01:15:55,941
What are your favourite childhood
memories?

1151
01:16:00,467 --> 01:16:02,879
My dad used to bring
me here every Sunday...

1152
01:16:06,167 --> 01:16:07,737
<i>To play Kabaddi with the sea</i>

1153
01:16:08,567 --> 01:16:10,137
<i>Kabaddi with the sea?</i>

1154
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:21,506
<i>Kabaddi kabaddi</i>

1155
01:16:22,834 --> 01:16:23,938
Go back!

1156
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:49,437
Just two more

1157
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:50,137
<i>0K6'!</i>

1158
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:04,543
I can do this all day long

1159
01:17:05,667 --> 01:17:11,049
It's important that parents create
happy memories for their children

1160
01:17:11,667 --> 01:17:14,375
Now I am a parent myself

1161
01:17:16,367 --> 01:17:19,075
So I'm hoping...

1162
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:23,407
my son has at least
some happy memories...

1163
01:17:25,334 --> 01:17:27,837
to tell his therapist

1164
01:17:32,367 --> 01:17:35,007
He stays with his mom

1165
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:39,473
In divorce cases kids
usually end up with the mother

1166
01:17:42,667 --> 01:17:50,381
I just regret not being
able to spend enough time with him

1167
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,308
I remember Shaira...

1168
01:18:04,267 --> 01:18:05,871
my doll

1169
01:18:08,734 --> 01:18:11,510
My dad's birthday gift to me

1170
01:18:12,667 --> 01:18:17,309
When I used to live with my
grandparents, Shaira was with me

1171
01:18:18,501 --> 01:18:24,417
I never played with her,
just kept her close to me

1172
01:18:24,701 --> 01:18:31,050
At night,
I would hug her tightly and sleep

1173
01:18:43,701 --> 01:18:45,874
You were shy?

1174
01:18:46,867 --> 01:18:48,005
Yes

1175
01:18:48,767 --> 01:18:50,269
l-low did you know'?

1176
01:18:51,934 --> 01:18:55,882
Shaira-Shy... I'm a genius, really

1177
01:18:55,934 --> 01:18:58,278
When I was little I was shy...

1178
01:18:58,334 --> 01:19:01,213
dad used to call me Kaira-Shaira

1179
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:02,779
But now I'm fully Kaira

1180
01:19:02,834 --> 01:19:04,814
Kaira-Shaira, now fully Kaira

1181
01:19:04,867 --> 01:19:05,845
Yes

1182
01:19:09,334 --> 01:19:10,870
Are you sure?

1183
01:19:15,367 --> 01:19:16,607
Come on

1184
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:22,773
Listen tell me...

1185
01:19:22,834 --> 01:19:25,872
why did you want me to talk
to Mom and Dad for 1O minutes?

1186
01:19:25,934 --> 01:19:29,575
Is there some Chinese
mountain story behind this?

1187
01:19:30,201 --> 01:19:32,511
Someday you'll have
to climb Mt. Everest right?

1188
01:20:03,267 --> 01:20:04,644
Where is Shaira?

1189
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,543
Who Shaira?

1190
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:07,873
My doll!

1191
01:20:07,934 --> 01:20:09,641
The one dad gave me

1192
01:20:09,701 --> 01:20:11,977
l-low come you thought
of that doll all of a sudden'?

1193
01:20:12,234 --> 01:20:13,372
Do you know where she is or not?

1194
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:14,572
She may be in the storeroom...

1195
01:20:14,667 --> 01:20:17,375
along with your and Kiddds old things

1196
01:20:17,434 --> 01:20:19,380
What do you mean by maybe?

1197
01:20:19,434 --> 01:20:21,380
She must be there somewhere

1198
01:20:21,434 --> 01:20:24,347
l-low will I remember
after all these years'?

1199
01:20:26,867 --> 01:20:29,313
Do you remember anything
at all about those years?

1200
01:20:32,767 --> 01:20:33,905
<i>Taste this Bibik</i>

1201
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:35,540
<i>What is Bibik now?</i>

1202
01:20:35,634 --> 01:20:38,274
<i>Bebinca! Kiddo's favourite</i>

1203
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:39,642
No I'm leaving

1204
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:42,237
<i>Pm making coconut Iaddoos for you...</i>

1205
01:20:42,301 --> 01:20:43,302
your favourite...

1206
01:20:43,601 --> 01:20:44,807
see I remembered

1207
01:20:44,901 --> 01:20:46,938
You just want to make me fat!

1208
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,770
Coconut laddoos/

1209
01:20:54,467 --> 01:20:58,438
I feel like breaking
a coconut on someone's head

1210
01:20:59,334 --> 01:21:03,544
No, no violence, do deep breathing

1211
01:21:03,667 --> 01:21:06,671
What memories will
parents leave behind?

1212
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,473
When they can't remember
anything themselves?

1213
01:21:08,534 --> 01:21:12,380
Let's drink to Shaira, wherever she is

1214
01:21:29,734 --> 01:21:33,307
<i>In my street</i>

1215
01:21:33,367 --> 01:21:35,745
<i>The moon that appears</i>

1216
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,246
<i>That brings Eid with it</i>

1217
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:41,179
<i>is that you?</i>

1218
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:43,576
<i>My</i> mom

<i>Has made me a suit</i>

1220
01:21:46,267 --> 01:21:48,406
<i>Has shown me a dream</i>

1221
01:21:48,467 --> 01:21:50,447
<i>is it of you?</i>

1222
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:53,504
<i>My heart is destroying

<i>Who is it?</i>

1224
01:21:55,367 --> 01:21:57,176
<i>Ifs you</i>

01:22:01,134 --> 01:22:03,614
<i>My heart is protecting

<i>Ifs you</i>

<i>Who is that so far</i> away

Who is that so close

1230
01:22:21,067 --> 01:22:25,743
<i>Who is that so specie!</i>

1231
01:22:25,801 --> 01:22:27,803
<i>Ifs you</i>

1232
01:22:47,334 --> 01:22:49,837
<i>The one for whom</i>

<i>I'd break all other hearts</i>

<i>is it you?</i>

01:23:07,267 --> 01:23:08,712
The one who's presence

<i>Makes all come alive</i>

1241
01:23:10,134 --> 01:23:11,670

<i>Who is in my poetry?</i>

<i>Who is in my diary?</i>

<i>Ifs you</i>

1251
01:24:05,001 --> 01:24:05,945
Hi!

1252
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,440
Oh hello...

1253
01:24:09,034 --> 01:24:10,445
That was a beautiful song

1254
01:24:10,534 --> 01:24:13,242
You have a beautiful voice

1255
01:24:13,667 --> 01:24:15,305
You totally rocked it

1256
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:20,276
If your audience is so rocking,
the song has to match up

1257
01:24:21,634 --> 01:24:24,137
I'm Jackie, this is Kaira

1258
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:28,644
And you are?

1259
01:24:30,034 --> 01:24:31,138
Rumi

1260
01:24:31,267 --> 01:24:32,507
Rumi?

1261
01:24:34,334 --> 01:24:35,278
Girls night out?

1262
01:24:35,334 --> 01:24:36,312
Yes

1263
01:24:36,367 --> 01:24:38,210
They are the best nights

1264
01:24:38,267 --> 01:24:40,713
Hey, great song bro...

1265
01:24:42,167 --> 01:24:44,010
...you killed it!

1266
01:24:44,067 --> 01:24:44,568
Did I?

1267
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:48,170
Killed who? We're all alive here

1268
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,503
Girls night, don't mind, cheers

1269
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,140
What a voice you have,
you should be singing in films

1270
01:24:55,200 --> 01:25:00,309
Why only films?
There are all kinds of music...

1271
01:25:00,967 --> 01:25:05,609
there is rock, pop, jazz, blues...

1272
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:09,380
do you like blues?

1273
01:25:09,967 --> 01:25:11,640
Blues?

1274
01:25:12,434 --> 01:25:14,573
You seem more red to me...

1275
01:25:17,234 --> 01:25:18,611
What?

1276
01:25:22,467 --> 01:25:24,606
<i>Vorresti fuggire con me?</i>

1277
01:25:25,001 --> 01:25:26,378
That was Greek to me...

1278
01:25:26,501 --> 01:25:27,946
It's Italian actually

1279
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,880
Does that mean that I'm
so deadly and gorgeous...

1280
01:25:32,001 --> 01:25:33,071
that you can't take your eyes off me?

1281
01:25:33,134 --> 01:25:34,579
Not at all

1282
01:25:35,967 --> 01:25:39,346
It means that I'm heading to a private
beach with some of my friends...

1283
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,004
to play some music

1284
01:25:41,967 --> 01:25:44,573
Would you like to run away with me?

1285
01:25:58,534 --> 01:25:59,979
Not bad

1286
01:26:56,901 --> 01:26:58,744
Somebody seems to be
in a musical mood today

1287
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:06,913
<i>""My heart is destroying itself
for someone, who is it? It's you""</i>

1288
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:09,106
Excuse me?

1289
01:27:11,767 --> 01:27:17,877
<i>""Last night! went
out to listen to</i> a <i>band""</i>

1290
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:24,176
<i>âWhich band was it,
where did you go where did you go?â</i>

1291
01:27:24,967 --> 01:27:29,814
<i>""The name of the band I don't know
I don't know. ..but singer! know""</i>

1292
01:27:29,934 --> 01:27:34,508
So <i>tell</i> me more...
<i>tell</i> me moremtel/ me more

1293
01:27:35,867 --> 01:27:39,041
We didn't talk, only music

1294
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:40,904
What to tell?

1295
01:27:41,734 --> 01:27:43,736
So what was his name? Banjo?

1296
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:47,748
Or the fellow was called Cello?

1297
01:27:48,067 --> 01:27:49,410
Rumi
- Wow!

1298
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:52,037
<i>My new kursi, my new chair</i>

1299
01:27:53,967 --> 01:27:54,945
So, comfortable?

1300
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:55,944
What?

1301
01:27:56,067 --> 01:27:58,069
New chair, comfortable?

1302
01:27:59,034 --> 01:28:02,413
Yes but it's a musical chair...

1303
01:28:02,667 --> 01:28:04,669
twenty four hours will
have to listen to music...

1304
01:28:04,734 --> 01:28:05,735
how to listen'?

1305
01:28:06,234 --> 01:28:09,738
Why don't you tell him straight,
that you like dialogue too

1306
01:28:09,834 --> 01:28:13,179
l-low can you tell a musician
to stop the music and talk'?

1307
01:28:13,301 --> 01:28:15,941
He'll think I'm a musical idiot...

1308
01:28:16,034 --> 01:28:18,036
have you ever felt like an idiot?

1309
01:28:20,267 --> 01:28:22,338
I've sat through a
three hour Italian Opera...

1310
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,911
pretended it touched my heart...

1311
01:28:25,067 --> 01:28:28,276
when every minute was torture

1312
01:28:29,301 --> 01:28:32,009
I wanted to stand up on the chair
and scream even louder than them...

1313
01:28:32,234 --> 01:28:33,941
<i>Pm an opera idiot!</i>

1314
01:28:39,067 --> 01:28:40,774
Wow, okay

1315
01:28:41,001 --> 01:28:44,005
What would you do if you
were dating an opera singer?

1316
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:46,137
I would say, 'Darling,
I will do anything for you...

1317
01:28:46,334 --> 01:28:48,280
but don't make me hear the opera'

1318
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,041
Then end of story right?
She would dump you and run

1319
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:54,240
Or after 6 months of suffering,
I would run away

1320
01:28:54,867 --> 01:28:59,077
If one is going to suffer,
the other person should at least know

1321
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:02,113
What is the point
of suffering in silence?

1322
01:29:04,867 --> 01:29:05,902
See when...

1323
01:29:08,034 --> 01:29:10,378
I'm so sorry - It's okay

1324
01:29:10,701 --> 01:29:11,873
I will get a new one for you

1325
01:29:12,034 --> 01:29:13,707
I'll do it, don't touch it...

1326
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:17,944
I think it's safer to have
our sessions outdoor

1327
01:29:19,201 --> 01:29:21,613
Go on, Rumi

1328
01:29:46,934 --> 01:29:49,938
I like people who smell nice

1329
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:53,610
I hate smelly people

1330
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:55,077
Really? Why'?

1331
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,973
So you like smelly people?

1332
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:01,104
Everyone has a different smell...

1333
01:30:01,367 --> 01:30:05,247
that's how people get
attracted to each other

1334
01:30:07,001 --> 01:30:10,642
Eeks! Who goes around smelling
people to get attracted?

1335
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,206
Dogs

1336
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:15,778
Dogs

1337
01:30:17,001 --> 01:30:18,981
Ya dogs!

1338
01:30:19,867 --> 01:30:22,814
Ganju, we should record
our conversations...

1339
01:30:23,134 --> 01:30:25,876
they're true genius sometimes

1340
01:30:25,934 --> 01:30:26,344
Genius!

1341
01:30:26,601 --> 01:30:27,636
Yes please

1342
01:30:28,034 --> 01:30:35,179
""Genius is not one
who has all the answers...

1343
01:30:36,134 --> 01:30:42,847
genius is one who has the
patience to find every answer""

1344
01:30:45,001 --> 01:30:45,672
Deep

1345
01:30:45,801 --> 01:30:47,337
Which genius said this?

1346
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,037
Dr. Jehangir Khan

1347
01:30:50,267 --> 01:30:51,940
Khan...khh

1348
01:30:52,001 --> 01:30:54,038
So does he smell nice?

1349
01:30:54,167 --> 01:30:55,373
Who?

1350
01:30:59,734 --> 01:31:00,144
There you go

1351
01:31:01,034 --> 01:31:05,141
Wait let it breathe...cheers

1352
01:31:12,534 --> 01:31:13,911
Listen to this bit

1353
01:31:15,134 --> 01:31:16,169
I love chocolate

1354
01:31:16,301 --> 01:31:17,871
Okay this bit

1355
01:31:26,934 --> 01:31:28,140
Wait one second

1356
01:31:30,067 --> 01:31:32,775
Pink Floyd's first album,
you have to get this

1357
01:31:35,934 --> 01:31:41,976
<i>""I agree,
you're the most beautiful of all""</i>

1358
01:31:43,667 --> 01:31:46,705
<i>""I agree,
you find</i> a <i>place in every heart""</i>

1359
01:31:46,767 --> 01:31:48,144
You like strawberries?

1360
01:31:50,967 --> 01:31:58,647
<i>âYes you are a dream
your every move is a charm...â</i>

1361
01:31:58,767 --> 01:32:04,115
""but, you're not one
to be wooed <i>by</i> praise""

1362
01:32:16,901 --> 01:32:17,242
Try some?

1363
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,946
Can we just have the music off please!

1364
01:32:23,067 --> 01:32:27,243
I'm sorry, I just need some silence

1365
01:32:35,534 --> 01:32:36,877
Everything okay'?

1366
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:40,606
I wrote this song for you

1367
01:32:41,167 --> 01:32:43,238
But it's okay,
silence is good sometimes...

1368
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,776
there is beauty in silence too...

1369
01:32:46,101 --> 01:32:48,012
let's be silent

1370
01:33:10,434 --> 01:33:11,435
That's not silent

1371
01:33:11,967 --> 01:33:13,503
I'm sorry

1372
01:33:19,401 --> 01:33:20,880
Okay play your song

1373
01:33:20,934 --> 01:33:22,845
No forget my song...

1374
01:33:23,467 --> 01:33:24,741
let's talk about you

1375
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:26,777
I want to know everything about you

1376
01:33:27,167 --> 01:33:30,148
Come, sit

1377
01:33:31,434 --> 01:33:32,674
Tell me about you

1378
01:33:32,734 --> 01:33:35,681
What was your first film about?

1379
01:33:36,034 --> 01:33:39,675
When did you decide
to be a cameravvoman?

1380
01:33:39,734 --> 01:33:40,804
What's your journey?

1381
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:46,046
You know, I haven't even
shot a selfie in my life

1382
01:33:46,867 --> 01:33:47,971
Isn't that funny?

1383
01:33:48,434 --> 01:33:48,878
So tell me...

1384
01:33:48,934 --> 01:33:53,474
I want to know about your dreams,
your inspirations, your aspirations...

1385
01:33:53,534 --> 01:33:55,411
I want to know everything about you

1386
01:33:58,734 --> 01:33:59,735
Huh?

1387
01:34:17,401 --> 01:34:18,539
What's going on?

1388
01:34:20,901 --> 01:34:21,936
Shall I put on some music?

1389
01:34:22,401 --> 01:34:23,539
Please

1390
01:34:23,967 --> 01:34:25,947
I've heard enough for a lifetime

1391
01:34:26,667 --> 01:34:30,945
So still suffering silently?
Or did you say it?

1392
01:34:31,467 --> 01:34:32,878
I yelled it

1393
01:34:32,934 --> 01:34:34,004
So he ran away?

1394
01:34:34,067 --> 01:34:37,480
No, he was very sweet actually

1395
01:34:40,367 --> 01:34:46,374
He stopped playing the song,
which he had composed for me...

1396
01:34:46,567 --> 01:34:49,741
and began asking about me

1397
01:34:51,834 --> 01:34:54,610
I felt guilty at first but...

1398
01:35:00,834 --> 01:35:05,681
Why are romantic
relationships so irritating?

1399
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:11,407
With friends,
it's all so easy, it just flows...

1400
01:35:11,767 --> 01:35:14,907
you don't need to make such an effort

1401
01:35:15,901 --> 01:35:18,939
Who are the 5 people closest to you?

1402
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:20,470
Your top 5?

1403
01:35:21,267 --> 01:35:22,302
Why?

1404
01:35:23,834 --> 01:35:24,835
There is an important study...

1405
01:35:25,367 --> 01:35:26,903
based on the size
of the human brain...

1406
01:35:26,967 --> 01:35:31,438
that shows that everyone has about
150 people in their whole universe

1407
01:35:31,667 --> 01:35:34,978
The next cut is the 5O who
you would invite home for dinner...

1408
01:35:35,034 --> 01:35:39,505
then 15 who you turn to
in times of need for comfort...

1409
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:44,641
and the final cut is of 5
people who are your whole world...

1410
01:35:44,767 --> 01:35:47,373
your inner circle

1411
01:35:50,467 --> 01:35:52,003
Who are your 5?

1412
01:35:55,934 --> 01:36:00,440
Fatty, Kiddo, Jackie, Alka...

1413
01:36:02,767 --> 01:36:04,246
Raghuvendra, no

1414
01:36:04,434 --> 01:36:06,345
And I forgot to add...

1415
01:36:06,934 --> 01:36:10,746
these 5 people can
also change with time

1416
01:36:11,334 --> 01:36:14,804
That's true but these 4
people will always be on the list

1417
01:36:14,867 --> 01:36:18,644
Okay, so think of these 4 and tell me

1418
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:21,442
l-low do you feel when
you are with them...

1419
01:36:21,801 --> 01:36:24,975
as compared to the changing 5th?

1420
01:36:25,234 --> 01:36:30,206
L-low, how do these
4 people make you feel'?

1421
01:36:31,334 --> 01:36:36,215
Special, I feel special I feel...

1422
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:40,280
important, I feel respected...

1423
01:36:40,334 --> 01:36:43,543
I feel happy and safe

1424
01:36:43,734 --> 01:36:47,648
So you don't feel safe
with your boyfriends?

1425
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,209
No...

1426
01:36:50,634 --> 01:36:53,240
I feel safe but...

1427
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:58,841
I don't know it's not that

1428
01:36:59,834 --> 01:37:01,507
With my friends...

1429
01:37:04,701 --> 01:37:08,478
I feel free, I feel like myself

1430
01:37:09,401 --> 01:37:10,903
Why safe?

1431
01:37:12,234 --> 01:37:15,772
When you start liking a guy...

1432
01:37:20,301 --> 01:37:22,212
What is your fear Kaira?

1433
01:37:30,301 --> 01:37:31,803
It's back in one piece

1434
01:37:34,367 --> 01:37:36,404
I believe broken things
can be put back together

1435
01:37:54,867 --> 01:37:57,313
l-low is the 'Brain Doctor' going'?

1436
01:37:57,367 --> 01:37:59,574
Is he married or single?

1437
01:37:59,734 --> 01:38:00,735
Didi...

1438
01:38:00,801 --> 01:38:02,712
Hi Alka!

1439
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:04,240
Look there

1440
01:38:05,567 --> 01:38:08,275
<i>Didi...
how are you?</i>

1441
01:38:08,334 --> 01:38:09,404
Rubbish

1442
01:38:10,801 --> 01:38:13,077
Why did you go to the doctor?
Are you okay?

1443
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:15,211
I went to a 'Brain Doctor'

1444
01:38:15,334 --> 01:38:16,779
What happened to your brain?

1445
01:38:18,134 --> 01:38:23,846
Nothing, if you have an
emotional problem in your life...

1446
01:38:24,101 --> 01:38:26,741
a 'Brain Doctor' can help you solve it

1447
01:38:27,134 --> 01:38:29,114
Do such doctors exist?

1448
01:38:30,834 --> 01:38:33,178
Then everyone should go to them

1449
01:38:34,101 --> 01:38:35,603
Yes everyone should

1450
01:38:43,234 --> 01:38:48,411
<i>I agree,
you're the most beautiful of all</i>

1451
01:38:50,767 --> 01:38:56,445
<i>I agree, you find</i>
a <i>place in every heart</i>

1452
01:38:58,334 --> 01:39:04,615
<i>Yes, you're a dream,
your every move a charm</i>

1453
01:39:04,667 --> 01:39:11,448
But, you're not one
to be wooed <i>by</i> praise...

1454
01:39:16,167 --> 01:39:17,703
Don't stop!

1455
01:39:17,767 --> 01:39:20,179
Come on, play the music

1456
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:37,706
<i>Heart...be silent</i>

1457
01:39:37,767 --> 01:39:40,509
<i>Don't beat so loud</i>

1458
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:48,378
<i>Let her not see
you suffer</i>

1459
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:56,143
<i>You will smile now at my state</i>

1460
01:39:56,200 --> 01:40:03,140
But, you're not one
to be wooed <i>by</i> praise

1461
01:40:21,067 --> 01:40:24,605
<i>Should I whisper in your ears</i>

1462
01:40:24,667 --> 01:40:28,171
<i>Or scream from mountain tops</i>

1463
01:40:31,167 --> 01:40:33,477
It was good fun

1464
01:40:33,534 --> 01:40:36,538
<i>We danced to Honey Singh
songs all night</i>

1465
01:40:36,634 --> 01:40:37,772
What's happening?

1466
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:39,635
Fatty!

1467
01:40:40,334 --> 01:40:42,746
I called you, why didn't you answer?

1468
01:40:43,001 --> 01:40:45,072
<i>Hi Koks</i>

1469
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:48,671
Why are you both grinning like that?

1470
01:40:48,734 --> 01:40:52,272
Jackie is just telling
me about her new boyfriend

1471
01:40:52,434 --> 01:40:53,435
What?

1472
01:40:54,167 --> 01:40:55,009
Hello?

1473
01:40:55,067 --> 01:40:56,307
What new boyfriend?

1474
01:40:56,367 --> 01:40:57,437
L-low about telling <i>me...</i>

1475
01:40:57,501 --> 01:40:59,503
I'm right here, am I invisible?

1476
01:40:59,567 --> 01:41:00,602
You didn't even ask

1477
01:41:00,667 --> 01:41:02,078
Why do I have to ask?

1478
01:41:02,134 --> 01:41:03,078
Okay guys relax

1479
01:41:03,134 --> 01:41:04,044
l-low can you not tell me'?

1480
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:07,980
I know why, because it's
that weird guy at the bar right'?

1481
01:41:08,034 --> 01:41:09,707
See this is what you do

1482
01:41:09,968 --> 01:41:11,003
You're always judging my men

1483
01:41:11,067 --> 01:41:12,978
I'm not judging,
you called him weird yourself

1484
01:41:13,034 --> 01:41:16,982
That was then, now I like him

1485
01:41:17,034 --> 01:41:19,981
But you didn't tell
me that you like him

1486
01:41:20,034 --> 01:41:22,173
Because you never asked,
you're not around

1487
01:41:22,234 --> 01:41:24,578
l-low am I supposed to
know if you don't tell me'?

1488
01:41:24,634 --> 01:41:28,172
You keep doing this
and blame me for everything

1489
01:41:28,234 --> 01:41:30,077
I am around!

1490
01:41:31,601 --> 01:41:33,274
Fatty where are you?

1491
01:41:35,067 --> 01:41:37,240
Great you also leave me

1492
01:41:45,034 --> 01:41:47,173
Good morning!

1493
01:41:48,067 --> 01:41:50,138
Good morning Jackie Chan

1494
01:41:52,067 --> 01:41:53,341
Anything special today?

1495
01:41:53,401 --> 01:41:54,471
Yes

1496
01:41:55,234 --> 01:41:56,304
Yo u

1497
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:58,546
You're so special

1498
01:42:02,067 --> 01:42:04,274
Okay, I'm special

1499
01:42:14,234 --> 01:42:16,441
So you fix cycles too'?

1500
01:42:16,934 --> 01:42:18,140
I try

1501
01:42:18,501 --> 01:42:22,643
And if I can't fix them,
I recycle them

1502
01:42:23,634 --> 01:42:27,275
Recycle a cycle?

1503
01:42:28,334 --> 01:42:32,248
Kaira, you have to
crack better jokes please

1504
01:42:34,234 --> 01:42:38,478
So all that cycle
art in your room and...

1505
01:42:39,334 --> 01:42:41,041
Hey, hi by the way!

1506
01:42:41,634 --> 01:42:46,379
This boy was wearing those funky
looking glasses, you made all that?

1507
01:42:46,434 --> 01:42:48,277
Finally! You noticed

1508
01:42:48,367 --> 01:42:49,641
He's an artist

1509
01:42:51,467 --> 01:42:57,179
If you can't fix people
do you recycle them too'?

1510
01:43:01,067 --> 01:43:02,205
Bye JUQ

1511
01:43:02,501 --> 01:43:04,071
Sorry about it

1512
01:43:04,967 --> 01:43:05,911
That's so mean

1513
01:43:05,967 --> 01:43:08,345
Yeah that's so mean, let's go

1514
01:43:12,001 --> 01:43:13,480
Why cycle today?

1515
01:43:14,001 --> 01:43:15,480
Just breaking the pattern

1516
01:43:15,567 --> 01:43:18,013
Yes, should break it

1517
01:43:19,167 --> 01:43:22,444
You must be going insane
listening to crazy people like me...

1518
01:43:22,534 --> 01:43:24,343
all day inside one room

1519
01:43:24,867 --> 01:43:25,402
Quite possible

1520
01:43:25,867 --> 01:43:27,039
Albert Einstein once said...

1521
01:43:27,267 --> 01:43:29,577
""An insane person is one who does
the same thing over and over again...

1522
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,980
and expects different
results each time""

1523
01:43:38,967 --> 01:43:42,540
By the way, Rumi, it's over...

1524
01:43:43,001 --> 01:43:43,979
Why?

1525
01:43:44,534 --> 01:43:46,536
Can't do it...

1526
01:43:47,334 --> 01:43:49,211
it's too much

1527
01:43:49,834 --> 01:43:51,836
He doesn't fit in my...

1528
01:43:52,167 --> 01:43:52,941
I don't know...

1529
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,809
I can't handle it it's too much

1530
01:43:54,934 --> 01:43:55,969
What's too much?

1531
01:43:56,201 --> 01:43:57,009
Too much

1532
01:43:57,167 --> 01:43:59,909
<i>Wait wait, Lance Armstrong</i>

1533
01:44:03,834 --> 01:44:05,973
Did Rumi do something wrong?

1534
01:44:06,167 --> 01:44:10,411
No we were just wrong
for each other...

1535
01:44:10,934 --> 01:44:12,174
Not this chair

1536
01:44:12,734 --> 01:44:16,876
Shiver! Only happens
when we feel cold...

1537
01:44:17,101 --> 01:44:20,412
or have a fever, or due to weather...

1538
01:44:21,101 --> 01:44:24,412
or sometimes people shiver
when they are scared...

1539
01:44:32,467 --> 01:44:34,071
I just want to be free...

1540
01:44:34,134 --> 01:44:36,410
free from all this

1541
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,071
I also want you to be free...

1542
01:44:39,401 --> 01:44:41,142
free from your fears

1543
01:44:41,267 --> 01:44:42,405
Free!

1544
01:44:43,467 --> 01:44:44,844
Oh wow

1545
01:44:47,067 --> 01:44:49,047
Help me

1546
01:44:50,434 --> 01:44:52,436
Damn, our time's up

1547
01:44:52,934 --> 01:44:53,173
What?

1548
01:44:53,234 --> 01:44:54,872
Got to go! Sorry

1549
01:44:54,934 --> 01:44:56,072
Jug!

1550
01:44:58,767 --> 01:45:00,678
Get my glasses please

1551
01:45:07,034 --> 01:45:08,809
My darling boy, all good?

1552
01:45:08,867 --> 01:45:10,005
Yes all good

1553
01:45:10,067 --> 01:45:13,310
Kiddo! Spend some time with me now,
not fair...

1554
01:45:13,367 --> 01:45:15,278
Sorry, I was getting ready...

1555
01:45:15,334 --> 01:45:17,280
you know it's my party,
I have to look nice

1556
01:45:17,434 --> 01:45:18,310
You look nice

1557
01:45:19,034 --> 01:45:21,742
So are you part of this matchmaking?

1558
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:22,244
Me?

1559
01:45:22,300 --> 01:45:23,108
Yes you

1560
01:45:23,167 --> 01:45:27,115
I have no clue but
I want to see the fun

1561
01:45:27,700 --> 01:45:30,442
Sweet boy Kiddo

1562
01:45:31,267 --> 01:45:34,908
And you,
is your best friend Jackie here?

1563
01:45:34,967 --> 01:45:38,073
Is she still single or...

1564
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:43,179
Yes, she's still very
much single and so is Kaira

1565
01:45:43,934 --> 01:45:46,210
Please stop, it's starting to hurt

1566
01:45:46,267 --> 01:45:48,110
Kaira, come

1567
01:45:52,967 --> 01:45:54,674
I want to introduce
you to a young man

1568
01:45:56,201 --> 01:45:57,271
This is my niece, Kaira

1569
01:45:57,334 --> 01:45:59,314
Hi Kaira, Suresh

1570
01:45:59,367 --> 01:46:00,744
Suresh

1571
01:46:00,901 --> 01:46:01,845
Pleasure

1572
01:46:02,134 --> 01:46:03,613
Well I'll see you'll later then

1573
01:46:03,667 --> 01:46:05,010
Alright, cheers

1574
01:46:05,667 --> 01:46:06,304
Cheers

1575
01:46:09,234 --> 01:46:12,841
So you're a photographer right?

1576
01:46:14,101 --> 01:46:15,603
Cinematographer actually

1577
01:46:15,701 --> 01:46:16,941
One and the same thing

1578
01:46:17,134 --> 01:46:18,112
No, it's not the same thing

1579
01:46:18,167 --> 01:46:18,941
It's not?
- No

1580
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:19,876
<i>0K6'!</i>

1581
01:46:20,934 --> 01:46:22,208
What do you do?

1582
01:46:22,867 --> 01:46:23,971
I'm a techie...

1583
01:46:25,934 --> 01:46:28,005
does that sound boring?

1584
01:46:28,067 --> 01:46:28,670
Fun

1585
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:31,371
It's fun, then cheers

1586
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:39,884
So, why should I be interested in you?

1587
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:43,941
That was pretty direct right?

1588
01:46:46,267 --> 01:46:52,377
I can be interesting
if I meet an interesting girl...

1589
01:46:53,334 --> 01:46:54,642
it depends

1590
01:46:55,001 --> 01:46:56,139
<i>0K6'!</i>

1591
01:46:57,767 --> 01:47:00,247
See Kiddo, your favourite food

1592
01:47:00,567 --> 01:47:01,238
Thank you

1593
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:07,174
What a sweet child Kiddo was,
never used to cry

1594
01:47:09,201 --> 01:47:12,842
Never left my side, always 'Mama Mama'

1595
01:47:13,034 --> 01:47:15,241
Well I figured 'Mama Mama'...

1596
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:19,771
was a better way to get
what I wanted than to cry

1597
01:47:20,834 --> 01:47:22,780
l-low fast these Kids grow up

1598
01:47:22,834 --> 01:47:23,244
I know

1599
01:47:23,301 --> 01:47:27,113
Look at Kiddo, he has achieved
so much at a young age

1600
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:30,874
He has got a scholarship
for a higher degree...

1601
01:47:30,934 --> 01:47:33,915
then an internship with a big firm...

1602
01:47:33,968 --> 01:47:35,641
tell them the name
of the company, Kiddo

1603
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:38,874
Dad, just stop it now

1604
01:47:40,234 --> 01:47:42,111
You will definitely be successful

1605
01:47:42,267 --> 01:47:44,747
You are doing the correct thing

1606
01:47:47,834 --> 01:47:49,609
You're not eating anything...

1607
01:47:49,701 --> 01:47:51,305
are you dieting again?

1608
01:47:51,701 --> 01:47:53,112
I don't feel like

1609
01:47:53,234 --> 01:47:54,542
Eat something

1610
01:47:56,001 --> 01:47:57,947
Fine, give it to me

1611
01:47:58,201 --> 01:47:59,737
Here have this

1612
01:48:00,467 --> 01:48:04,574
You remember Chanda,
Kiddo was such a gentle, quiet boy...

1613
01:48:04,834 --> 01:48:07,974
but Kaira, a real firecracker...

1614
01:48:08,034 --> 01:48:10,014
she's still the same

1615
01:48:10,201 --> 01:48:11,839
Firecracker yes,
you're absolutely right...

1616
01:48:11,901 --> 01:48:16,475
anger, tantrums and sulking,
most of all with me

1617
01:48:16,734 --> 01:48:21,774
You Kids have no idea how
tough it is to be a parent...

1618
01:48:21,967 --> 01:48:25,540
and it's never ending

1619
01:48:25,734 --> 01:48:27,975
Once a parent always a parent

1620
01:48:28,034 --> 01:48:28,739
I agree

1621
01:48:28,801 --> 01:48:30,803
No holiday from this job, right Ashu?

1622
01:48:30,867 --> 01:48:32,904
<i>All parents should be awarded
a President's Award</i>

1623
01:48:33,034 --> 01:48:33,944
Huh?

1624
01:48:34,001 --> 01:48:35,105
I love the food

1625
01:48:36,634 --> 01:48:37,942
So end it then

1626
01:48:38,167 --> 01:48:39,077
Just end it

1627
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:40,505
What?

1628
01:48:40,567 --> 01:48:42,843
The job of being a parent, just end it

1629
01:48:44,067 --> 01:48:47,742
You Keep going on and on about
how 'tough' it is, so just end it

1630
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:51,041
Who has forced you
to continue being parents?

1631
01:48:51,234 --> 01:48:52,235
Has anyone forced you to?

1632
01:48:52,734 --> 01:48:57,479
You didn't start the job well in
the first place so why continue it...

1633
01:48:57,534 --> 01:48:58,979
just put an end to it!

1634
01:49:00,834 --> 01:49:05,408
When kids need you the most
you happily leave them and go

1635
01:49:05,467 --> 01:49:07,174
and then complain
about their tantrums...

1636
01:49:07,434 --> 01:49:10,540
'Oh how angry she gets, makes faces'

1637
01:49:11,634 --> 01:49:14,808
It was your idea to
bring us into the world...

1638
01:49:14,867 --> 01:49:17,143
you treated us the way you wanted...

1639
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:21,041
and then you blame
us for how we behave...

1640
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:22,010
and you say it's 'tough'...

1641
01:49:22,434 --> 01:49:23,640
What do you mean by 'tough?

1642
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:24,838
Tough my foot!

1643
01:49:30,134 --> 01:49:31,704
L-low could you just abandon me'?

1644
01:49:34,734 --> 01:49:36,111
L-low could you just do that'?

1645
01:49:39,701 --> 01:49:41,146
L-low could you just do that'?

1646
01:49:41,534 --> 01:49:43,775
L-low could you both leave me and go'?

1647
01:49:44,501 --> 01:49:48,074
And the only reason you took me back
was because I failed the 2nd grade...

1648
01:49:48,134 --> 01:49:49,977
yes, I failed the 2nd grade!

1649
01:49:50,034 --> 01:49:51,707
Shame Shame!

1650
01:49:51,768 --> 01:49:54,442
Dumb Kaira failed the second grade!

1651
01:49:54,768 --> 01:49:56,941
Such an embarrassment for you...

1652
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,776
that you left everything
and came back to India?

1653
01:50:01,901 --> 01:50:06,577
And when I was finally happy
living with my grandparents,

1654
01:50:06,667 --> 01:50:08,510
you dragged me away from there too

1655
01:50:08,934 --> 01:50:10,004
You separated me even from them

1656
01:50:10,401 --> 01:50:11,175
Yes

1657
01:50:11,834 --> 01:50:14,144
<i>President's Award just for that!</i>

1658
01:50:18,834 --> 01:50:20,142
And I have a firecracking
news for you!

1659
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:21,902
Actually a bomb!

1660
01:50:22,100 --> 01:50:23,170
Are you ready?

1661
01:50:23,768 --> 01:50:25,941
I have begun therapy!

1662
01:50:27,501 --> 01:50:30,141
Yes! I am seeing a 'Brain Doctor'

1663
01:50:30,534 --> 01:50:32,775
So feel free to call me crazy, mad

1664
01:50:32,834 --> 01:50:35,075
Please say it to me
right now say it to my face

1665
01:50:35,567 --> 01:50:36,409
Say it!

1666
01:50:36,467 --> 01:50:38,174
I'm crazy! 'Kukoood

1667
01:50:38,434 --> 01:50:40,471
'Kaira's gone mad!'

1668
01:50:45,934 --> 01:50:48,471
That's what you think...

1669
01:50:51,534 --> 01:50:52,945
that people like me are crazy

1670
01:51:03,067 --> 01:51:04,705
She is a bit emotional right now...

1671
01:51:06,067 --> 01:51:07,671
she is also out of work

1672
01:51:07,733 --> 01:51:08,677
Dad, she has enough work

1673
01:51:09,967 --> 01:51:12,004
She has chosen not to work right now

1674
01:51:16,634 --> 01:51:19,740
Kiddo, go get her

1675
01:51:19,901 --> 01:51:20,902
Don't worry

1676
01:51:20,967 --> 01:51:22,446
Make her understand that...

1677
01:51:22,967 --> 01:51:25,880
once your parents moved back,
she never failed in school again...

1678
01:51:26,801 --> 01:51:30,078
so they took the right decision

1679
01:51:30,967 --> 01:51:32,947
There are all kinds of failures...

1680
01:51:34,601 --> 01:51:35,773
and I am looking at a few right now

1681
01:52:08,367 --> 01:52:09,345
You okay?

1682
01:52:11,434 --> 01:52:12,640
I don't know

1683
01:52:24,434 --> 01:52:26,414
Were you happy as a child?

1684
01:52:27,634 --> 01:52:29,409
I only remember being
happy once you came home

1685
01:52:36,034 --> 01:52:37,536
See this

1686
01:52:39,734 --> 01:52:41,543
Where did you find that?

1687
01:52:42,534 --> 01:52:44,275
I was looking for
something from my past...

1688
01:52:44,934 --> 01:52:46,436
and found something from ours instead

1689
01:52:59,934 --> 01:53:00,776
You know...

1690
01:53:01,234 --> 01:53:04,841
As children, when we are sad,
our elders tell us not to cry

1691
01:53:05,234 --> 01:53:08,272
When we are angry,
they tell us 'give us a smile'

1692
01:53:08,567 --> 01:53:10,308
You know why?

1693
01:53:10,934 --> 01:53:12,914
Just to keep the peace at home

1694
01:53:13,467 --> 01:53:16,471
When we wanted to hate
they didn't allow us...

1695
01:53:17,467 --> 01:53:18,741
so now when we want to love...

1696
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:23,545
we suddenly find our whole
emotional system is topsy-turvy...

1697
01:53:24,367 --> 01:53:25,846
it cannot function

1698
01:53:27,234 --> 01:53:28,838
Sadness, anger, hate...

1699
01:53:29,467 --> 01:53:31,413
we were not allowed
to express anything...

1700
01:53:32,667 --> 01:53:34,203
so now, how do we express love'?

1701
01:53:40,867 --> 01:53:45,213
It's okay to be angry sometimes,
even with parents...

1702
01:53:45,901 --> 01:53:46,902
It's good, it's healthy...

1703
01:53:47,634 --> 01:53:49,944
it's okay Kaira...

1704
01:54:04,234 --> 01:54:08,649
They left me at my grandparents' house

1705
01:54:12,734 --> 01:54:15,476
Mom told me this was like a vacation,
that I would join them soon

1706
01:54:18,801 --> 01:54:23,511
Dad's export business
in Goa had failed...

1707
01:54:24,534 --> 01:54:30,348
so he went to Africa, Middle East
looking for business opportunities...

1708
01:54:30,534 --> 01:54:31,706
mom went with him

1709
01:54:34,867 --> 01:54:39,282
In the beginning I was happy
staying with my grandparents...

1710
01:54:39,834 --> 01:54:41,780
in their big old house in Vasco

1711
01:55:00,201 --> 01:55:03,114
I would write a letter
to mom and dad every week...

1712
01:55:04,667 --> 01:55:06,203
sometimes even twice a week

1713
01:55:08,634 --> 01:55:15,813
At that age, 'writing'
meant drawing some pictures...

1714
01:55:16,301 --> 01:55:18,508
trying to write some big words...

1715
01:55:21,168 --> 01:55:24,672
but every letter ended
with the same question...

1716
01:55:27,501 --> 01:55:29,071
'When will you come back?'

1717
01:55:33,467 --> 01:55:34,411
I was 5 years old...

1718
01:55:36,334 --> 01:55:40,840
every week I would drop my letters
in the mailbox with my grandad...

1719
01:55:41,267 --> 01:55:44,544
then I would wait for a letter

1720
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:47,480
wait for an answer to my question...

1721
01:55:53,334 --> 01:55:54,506
but it never came

1722
01:55:57,567 --> 01:56:02,539
When they called once a month,
they had some e><cuse each time...

1723
01:56:04,534 --> 01:56:09,711
something about 'an address change, no
post office close by, feeling unwell' etc etc

1724
01:56:12,601 --> 01:56:14,308
but I still kept writing

1725
01:56:17,068 --> 01:56:19,139
And my grandad would keep
walking me to the mailbox...

1726
01:56:19,767 --> 01:56:24,045
he always said that I will
get my answer some day soon

1727
01:56:27,667 --> 01:56:31,171
Then, a year later
mom visited me in Goa...

1728
01:56:33,101 --> 01:56:36,548
with my new baby brother, Kiddo

1729
01:56:40,734 --> 01:56:41,542
I was jealous

1730
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:48,014
Because he got to be with
mom all the time, and not me

1731
01:56:50,667 --> 01:56:56,276
then mom said that I would be away
from them for 'just a little longer'

1732
01:56:58,234 --> 01:56:59,645
so I was still fine with it...

1733
01:57:02,134 --> 01:57:05,581
I remember asking my
mom if she got my last letter

1734
01:57:07,134 --> 01:57:11,674
she said that it was so beautiful that
she put it up on the refridgerator...

1735
01:57:11,934 --> 01:57:13,277
so that she could see it every day

1736
01:57:13,634 --> 01:57:15,238
I was so happy...

1737
01:57:17,001 --> 01:57:21,279
I ran to my room so I could
write another letter for her...

1738
01:57:21,967 --> 01:57:25,210
so I could see her get
happy in front of my own eyes

1739
01:57:25,467 --> 01:57:28,448
A scene I had imagined
in my head many times

1740
01:57:29,534 --> 01:57:33,380
So I took out my colours and paints...

1741
01:57:34,134 --> 01:57:39,311
drew a picture and
ran to show it to her

1742
01:57:40,300 --> 01:57:44,646
As I was about to enter the room I
heard my grandad shouting at my mom...

1743
01:57:45,334 --> 01:57:49,544
he was telling her that what
she was doing was not right...

1744
01:57:49,667 --> 01:57:51,408
how could she not respond
to my question, to my letters...

1745
01:57:52,434 --> 01:57:55,313
and then, I heard my mom reply...

1746
01:57:57,067 --> 01:58:02,244
""I can't give her false hope...

1747
01:58:04,001 --> 01:58:08,279
the truth is that we can't
take her back just <i>yet...</i>

1748
01:58:09,467 --> 01:58:11,344
not until the business is set up...

1749
01:58:12,334 --> 01:58:14,541
It is too tough to
handle two children...

1750
01:58:15,967 --> 01:58:18,379
and travel constantly blah blah

1751
01:58:20,567 --> 01:58:21,978
But everything just seemed to...

1752
01:58:23,334 --> 01:58:24,074
fade away...

1753
01:58:31,401 --> 01:58:33,972
It was a strange feeling...

1754
01:58:37,167 --> 01:58:42,173
like someone had grabbed
the TV remote from me...

1755
01:58:43,401 --> 01:58:49,317
and changed the channel from something
I loved to something horrid...

1756
01:58:51,100 --> 01:58:52,875
and then threw out the remote

1757
01:58:57,434 --> 01:59:02,941
I went back to my room,
tore up the letter...

1758
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:07,410
I was 6...

1759
01:59:09,034 --> 01:59:12,208
took a decision as a 6 year old...

1760
01:59:13,934 --> 01:59:18,349
that I had nothing more to
say to them, nothing more to ask...

1761
01:59:25,334 --> 01:59:27,336
I didn't write a letter
ever again in my entire life

1762
01:59:28,334 --> 01:59:29,005
Never

1763
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:37,347
My poor grandad kept
trying to get me to write...

1764
01:59:38,967 --> 01:59:41,277
but I knew I had nothing
to say to my parents...

1765
01:59:43,568 --> 01:59:45,548
or to anyone else...

1766
01:59:48,434 --> 01:59:49,504
I just became quiet

1767
01:59:51,534 --> 01:59:52,512
I shut down

1768
02:00:00,101 --> 02:00:02,581
Then a year later my mom said
that they were coming back for good...

1769
02:00:05,234 --> 02:00:09,478
dad's friend had a business
partnership for him in Goa itself

1770
02:00:11,534 --> 02:00:14,981
In all these years, dad couldn't
set up his business abroad

1771
02:00:15,834 --> 02:00:20,340
So imagine, all this for nothing

1772
02:00:22,801 --> 02:00:24,041
So they came back

1773
02:00:26,034 --> 02:00:30,346
But that year was the
most stressful for me...

1774
02:00:33,468 --> 02:00:35,004
I didn't want to be with them

1775
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:39,309
I wanted to stay with my grandparents

1776
02:00:41,300 --> 02:00:43,007
They were separating me from them too

1777
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:46,408
I threw tantrums...

1778
02:00:46,467 --> 02:00:50,005
cried a lot, troubled everyone

1779
02:00:50,534 --> 02:00:52,810
To top it all,
I failed the 2nd grade...

1780
02:00:53,901 --> 02:00:58,043
and that, not my 100 letters...

1781
02:00:58,434 --> 02:01:02,780
not the fact that I was their
daughter living away from them

1782
02:01:03,167 --> 02:01:06,171
But my failure made them
take me away from my grandparents...

1783
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:08,746
and back with them finally

1784
02:01:39,501 --> 02:01:41,412
I'm sorry

1785
02:01:45,967 --> 02:01:47,469
I'm sorry

1786
02:01:51,300 --> 02:01:56,807
If you don't cry wholeheartedly,
how will you laugh wholeheartedly?

1787
02:01:57,067 --> 02:01:59,104
It's okay...

1788
02:02:06,068 --> 02:02:09,447
I'm not much for rules...

1789
02:02:09,701 --> 02:02:14,013
but because of the rules...

1790
02:02:15,868 --> 02:02:20,749
I can't pop a champagne
bottle to celebrate this moment...

1791
02:02:20,967 --> 02:02:23,948
but we can do the next best thing

1792
02:02:35,234 --> 02:02:36,941
To letters, Kaira

1793
02:02:37,001 --> 02:02:38,002
Cheers!

1794
02:02:40,834 --> 02:02:41,938
Go easy...

1795
02:02:55,634 --> 02:03:00,606
To feel safe,
first the fears have to go

1796
02:03:01,934 --> 02:03:04,676
The fear of being abandoned,
of being left alone...

1797
02:03:06,934 --> 02:03:10,177
You have carried this
fear with you all your life...

1798
02:03:11,601 --> 02:03:20,817
this burden is falling on all your
relationships, especially on your love life

1799
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:25,012
So you leave others
before they can leave you

1800
02:03:25,367 --> 02:03:29,907
You want to say bye
before they can say bye

1801
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:36,940
Because you never want
to face that pain again

1802
02:03:39,801 --> 02:03:41,212
So, Kaira

1803
02:03:43,167 --> 02:03:49,083
Why not say bye to
this fear once and for all?

1804
02:03:50,967 --> 02:03:56,280
Why not say hi to life once again?

1805
02:04:00,834 --> 02:04:06,113
I am not saying that you
should forgive your parents...

1806
02:04:06,267 --> 02:04:08,008
or even to stop being angry...

1807
02:04:08,068 --> 02:04:10,014
you do as you wish

1808
02:04:10,300 --> 02:04:11,802
But I will say this...

1809
02:04:12,034 --> 02:04:16,949
try to look at them not in
the exalted status of parents...

1810
02:04:18,900 --> 02:04:21,278
but just as two regular people...

1811
02:04:23,234 --> 02:04:28,912
who make mistakes, like everyone else

1812
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,877
As a child it is hard
to understand all this...

1813
02:04:31,934 --> 02:04:33,880
but now, as an adult...

1814
02:04:34,101 --> 02:04:36,012
you can at least try

1815
02:04:39,668 --> 02:04:46,916
Don't let the past blackmail your
present to ruin a beautiful future

1816
02:05:04,234 --> 02:05:07,215
<i>When something touches your heart</i>

1817
02:05:08,034 --> 02:05:11,743
<i>Say hi to</i> it...

1818
02:05:12,967 --> 02:05:16,710
<i>When your heart is not in it</i>

1819
02:05:16,867 --> 02:05:20,747
Say bye to it...

1820
02:05:21,634 --> 02:05:23,636
<i>Let it come, let it come</i>

1821
02:05:23,700 --> 02:05:25,805
<i>Let it come into your heart</i>

1822
02:05:25,867 --> 02:05:28,609
<i>Say hi to happiness</i>

1823
02:05:30,134 --> 02:05:32,239
<i>Let it go, let it go</i>

1824
02:05:32,534 --> 02:05:34,571
<i>Let it go from your heart</i>

1825
02:05:34,634 --> 02:05:41,711
<i>Say bye bye to unhappiness...</i>

1826
02:05:42,167 --> 02:05:45,239
<i>Love you life</i>

1827
02:05:46,667 --> 02:05:54,984
<i>Love you life</i>

1828
02:05:55,134 --> 02:06:01,141
<i>Love me life</i>

1829
02:06:19,867 --> 02:06:23,144
Koko, I'm sorry

1830
02:06:25,468 --> 02:06:26,708
I'm sorry

1831
02:06:29,867 --> 02:06:30,402
Hello?

1832
02:06:30,467 --> 02:06:32,845
Hi Ma'am, I am calling from eBay,
are you happy with our services?

1833
02:06:32,900 --> 02:06:33,503
Yes why?

1834
02:06:33,967 --> 02:06:36,880
Please do continue shopping with us

1835
02:06:36,934 --> 02:06:37,878
Thank you

1836
02:06:53,634 --> 02:07:01,348
<i>Sometimes hold my hand,
and walk with me</i>

1837
02:07:01,734 --> 02:07:08,015
Sometimes leave <i>my hand,</i>
and let me go free

1838
02:07:10,834 --> 02:07:12,609
<i>I'm</i> a <i>little moody</i>

1839
02:07:12,967 --> 02:07:14,844
<i>You're</i> a <i>little crazy</i>

1840
02:07:14,901 --> 02:07:19,077
<i>What a pair we are</i>

1841
02:07:19,334 --> 02:07:21,439
<i>Let it come, let it come</i>

1842
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:23,605
<i>Let it come into your heart</i>

1843
02:07:23,667 --> 02:07:27,843
<i>Say hi to happiness...</i>

1844
02:07:27,900 --> 02:07:30,039
<i>Let it go, let it go</i>

1845
02:07:30,101 --> 02:07:32,342
<i>Let it go from your heart</i>

1846
02:07:32,401 --> 02:07:39,341
<i>Say bye bye to unhappiness...</i>

1847
02:07:39,934 --> 02:07:49,616
<i>Love you life</i>

1848
02:07:53,067 --> 02:07:57,482
<i>Love me life</i>

1849
02:07:59,567 --> 02:08:02,810
You are different...

1850
02:08:04,468 --> 02:08:08,541
you listen to me, you really listen

1851
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:13,777
I wish I had someone
like you in my life...

1852
02:08:13,967 --> 02:08:15,674
Am I making sense?

1853
02:08:16,034 --> 02:08:19,572
Not at all,
but that will be 3000 rupees please

1854
02:09:07,834 --> 02:09:09,313
Where were you?

1855
02:09:09,667 --> 02:09:10,975
Just disappeared

1856
02:09:11,500 --> 02:09:14,640
I have to give proper
notice if I miss a session...

1857
02:09:14,701 --> 02:09:18,410
and you left me with one small note

1858
02:09:18,467 --> 02:09:20,538
'Sorry'... that's not fair

1859
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:23,581
I know, life is unfair

1860
02:09:24,534 --> 02:09:25,638
Fine

1861
02:09:26,734 --> 02:09:27,872
Hide all your secrets

1862
02:09:34,367 --> 02:09:35,311
You know...

1863
02:09:35,367 --> 02:09:39,247
my issues with my
parents may get sorted...

1864
02:09:39,534 --> 02:09:43,243
but with men!

1865
02:09:43,500 --> 02:09:45,605
I am never going to find anyone

1866
02:09:52,701 --> 02:09:53,839
Tell me something

1867
02:09:55,834 --> 02:10:00,340
ls there such a thing
as a perfect relationship?

1868
02:10:00,567 --> 02:10:04,515
Like just one special relationship?

1869
02:10:06,901 --> 02:10:08,812
Kaira I think...

1870
02:10:09,600 --> 02:10:14,310
why just that one
special relationship?

1871
02:10:14,934 --> 02:10:17,244
I think one can have
many relationships in life...

1872
02:10:17,300 --> 02:10:19,780
different relationships
for different experiences...

1873
02:10:19,834 --> 02:10:23,839
like a musical relationship...

1874
02:10:24,301 --> 02:10:28,716
someone who shares
our interest in music...

1875
02:10:29,367 --> 02:10:32,541
or the lets-get-coffee-together
relationship...

1876
02:10:32,834 --> 02:10:37,943
perfect to have coffee with...
but not anything else...

1877
02:10:39,234 --> 02:10:41,544
Special gossip relationship...

1878
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:44,740
with whom you can
have the perfect gossip

1879
02:10:45,301 --> 02:10:48,305
Or the special
intellectual relationship...

1880
02:10:48,467 --> 02:10:52,210
for all those perfect
bookish discussions...

1881
02:10:53,234 --> 02:10:57,341
So many different,
special relationships...

1882
02:11:02,134 --> 02:11:06,913
The romantic relationship
is just one of many

1883
02:11:08,234 --> 02:11:13,234
To expect a single relationship
to take on the burden of every need...

1884
02:11:19,467 --> 02:11:21,640
a bit unfair, right?

1885
02:11:28,567 --> 02:11:30,137
Never thought of it this way

1886
02:11:39,701 --> 02:11:41,476
I'm glad the camera is back

1887
02:11:41,534 --> 02:11:42,842
Me too

1888
02:11:50,634 --> 02:11:56,107
Jug, do you want to get
a cup of coffee or something?

1889
02:11:56,634 --> 02:12:00,309
No, our time's up

1890
02:12:03,734 --> 02:12:06,180
You won't bunk the next session right'?

1891
02:12:06,334 --> 02:12:08,314
It is the last week of our sessions...

1892
02:12:08,767 --> 02:12:10,440
how can I miss that'?

1893
02:12:41,301 --> 02:12:43,804
So, done sulking with Goa?

1894
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:45,538
No more sulking

1895
02:12:47,467 --> 02:12:48,844
What about your work?

1896
02:12:49,134 --> 02:12:51,375
Actually I got an offer

1897
02:12:52,200 --> 02:12:52,837
What?

1898
02:12:53,667 --> 02:12:57,410
A production company is interested
in funding my short film...

1899
02:12:57,700 --> 02:13:02,672
so I am thinking,
why not stay back here and shoot it

1900
02:13:15,667 --> 02:13:19,444
Since it's the final class,
have I passed?

1901
02:13:20,300 --> 02:13:23,645
This isn't school, to pass or fail

1902
02:13:26,267 --> 02:13:29,373
I wish there were teachers
like you in school

1903
02:13:29,734 --> 02:13:31,509
I'm no teacher

1904
02:13:32,034 --> 02:13:34,378
Okay not teacher but...

1905
02:13:35,200 --> 02:13:36,508
you know what I mean

1906
02:13:37,101 --> 02:13:41,106
We are all our own teachers
in the school of life

1907
02:13:41,501 --> 02:13:43,572
Okay, that got a bit heavy

1908
02:13:45,234 --> 02:13:50,206
Life is like a jigsaw puzzle

1909
02:13:50,634 --> 02:13:55,174
People like me can help
you find the missing pieces...

1910
02:13:55,334 --> 02:13:58,247
and put them back together...

1911
02:13:59,701 --> 02:14:03,046
but, only you can complete the puzzle

1912
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:17,245
So now that this is over...

1913
02:14:21,601 --> 02:14:26,380
can we meet outside of this...

1914
02:14:27,501 --> 02:14:30,277
just as friends or something?

1915
02:14:30,534 --> 02:14:33,140
No this is not possible Kaira

1916
02:14:33,267 --> 02:14:36,305
And what if I tell you...

1917
02:14:36,968 --> 02:14:38,709
that I like you...

1918
02:14:42,968 --> 02:14:44,038
In fact...

1919
02:14:48,101 --> 02:14:50,172
Go on, I'm listening

1920
02:14:53,101 --> 02:14:55,445
In fact I really like you

1921
02:14:58,567 --> 02:15:01,104
That's it, said it

1922
02:15:05,001 --> 02:15:07,038
I really like you too

1923
02:15:08,200 --> 02:15:10,077
I really like you

1924
02:15:11,034 --> 02:15:13,207
I respect your feelings...

1925
02:15:13,867 --> 02:15:17,041
but my job here is done for now

1926
02:15:17,534 --> 02:15:23,974
As unconventional and friendly
as my methods may be...

1927
02:15:24,234 --> 02:15:28,114
I am still your therapist...

1928
02:15:29,267 --> 02:15:35,479
any other 'friendship' would be outside
the realm of my own professional ethics

1929
02:15:39,301 --> 02:15:46,150
The closeness that you may feel to me,
your 'BET...

1930
02:15:46,200 --> 02:15:48,874
is very normal

1931
02:15:51,267 --> 02:15:55,875
This happens, it's common

1932
02:15:56,034 --> 02:15:56,978
So I'm common?

1933
02:15:57,034 --> 02:16:00,982
No, you are not common

1934
02:16:01,100 --> 02:16:03,512
You are different, special...

1935
02:16:03,867 --> 02:16:05,403
you are unique

1936
02:16:07,334 --> 02:16:08,176
You know Kaira

1937
02:16:08,234 --> 02:16:15,152
People feel all sorts
of strong emotions in here...

1938
02:16:15,367 --> 02:16:18,940
anger, hate, love

1939
02:16:19,900 --> 02:16:22,506
I shouldn't have said anything

1940
02:16:22,567 --> 02:16:24,478
No, you should have

1941
02:16:24,867 --> 02:16:28,906
It's really good
you said what you said

1942
02:16:29,567 --> 02:16:34,312
You expressed your
difficult feelings...

1943
02:16:34,367 --> 02:16:38,873
in a straightforward
and mature manner...

1944
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:42,909
rather than letting them fester...

1945
02:16:43,067 --> 02:16:46,014
inside of you...

1946
02:16:46,834 --> 02:16:48,279
and we don't want that...

1947
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:48,978
<i>No</i>

1948
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:56,907
This Kaira, is huge progress

1949
02:17:11,234 --> 02:17:14,477
Okay but, tell me one thing

1950
02:17:14,934 --> 02:17:16,743
l-low can this be the last session'?

1951
02:17:16,801 --> 02:17:19,145
No no...

1952
02:17:20,467 --> 02:17:22,174
No more stories?

1953
02:17:22,834 --> 02:17:26,077
So many new problems I will have...

1954
02:17:26,934 --> 02:17:32,043
Yes there will be many problems...

1955
02:17:32,734 --> 02:17:39,083
but now you know how to solve them

1956
02:17:43,067 --> 02:17:45,343
But I'll need help

1957
02:17:46,967 --> 02:17:48,776
I need you

1958
02:17:56,300 --> 02:17:57,370
Kaira...

1959
02:17:58,201 --> 02:18:00,681
when you see a pattern
emerging in life...

1960
02:18:01,067 --> 02:18:06,710
a habit,
then it's time to think about it

1961
02:18:07,101 --> 02:18:10,344
Genius is about knowing when to stop

1962
02:19:17,167 --> 02:19:18,339
Okay then

1963
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:25,772
Baby Fatima, can't believe it

1964
02:21:28,567 --> 02:21:33,915
<i>This is your godmother, Kokomaa</i>

1965
02:21:42,134 --> 02:21:45,081
Battle after battle

1966
02:21:45,734 --> 02:21:50,615
Corporal Balthazar fought
in the Portuguese army for 14 years

1967
02:21:52,101 --> 02:21:56,516
Nobody knew that Corporal
Balthazar was not Balthazar...

1968
02:21:56,567 --> 02:21:59,571
but Dona Maria, a woman...

1969
02:21:59,933 --> 02:22:02,846
disguised as a man

1970
02:22:03,100 --> 02:22:09,073
This was the only way for a woman
to safeguard her life and dignity

1971
02:22:09,234 --> 02:22:12,807
For 14 years Dona Maria
fought two battles...

1972
02:22:12,867 --> 02:22:16,679
one on the battlefield,
and the other with herself...

1973
02:22:16,867 --> 02:22:19,780
with her fears

1974
02:22:19,834 --> 02:22:23,111
Finally, one day on the battlefield,
her true identity was revealed

1975
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:24,635
As fate would have it...

1976
02:22:24,767 --> 02:22:27,543
in front of Captain Aphonso...

1977
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:34,908
Captain Aphonso...

1978
02:22:35,067 --> 02:22:37,741
Commander of the fort and a doctor...

1979
02:22:37,900 --> 02:22:39,538
not only saved Dona Maria's life...

1980
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:40,806
and nursed her wounds...

1981
02:22:40,933 --> 02:22:43,573
but made her fears disappear...

1982
02:22:44,201 --> 02:22:48,172
and freed her from the
ghost of Corporal Balthazar

1983
02:22:50,601 --> 02:22:52,205
For the first time...

1984
02:22:52,467 --> 02:22:55,175
Dona Maria had the courage
to face her true self

1985
02:22:55,900 --> 02:23:00,440
Finally she felt free, she felt alive

1986
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:09,718
With her newfound courage,
Dona Maria soon became Commander...

1987
02:23:09,900 --> 02:23:13,541
the first woman Commander
of the Portuguese army...

1988
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:17,978
Now, Donna Maria fought
only one battle...

1989
02:23:18,667 --> 02:23:21,978
the one on the battlefield

1990
02:24:15,434 --> 02:24:16,913
Speech! Speech!

1991
02:24:16,967 --> 02:24:19,880
No speech, just shut up!

1992
02:24:21,034 --> 02:24:23,514
It was beautiful my darling

1993
02:24:25,400 --> 02:24:27,402
So proud of you

1994
02:24:31,867 --> 02:24:33,039
Beautiful film

1995
02:24:33,500 --> 02:24:33,807
Really?

1996
02:24:33,901 --> 02:24:34,777
Very impressed

1997
02:24:36,001 --> 02:24:39,471
People who make music with
the camera don't need musicians

1998
02:24:42,533 --> 02:24:44,877
I wrote a song for you,
want to listen?

1999
02:24:45,667 --> 02:24:46,941
Just kidding

2000
02:24:48,734 --> 02:24:49,804
I'm proud of you

2001
02:24:50,567 --> 02:24:52,808
You gave Kaira her first break right?

2002
02:24:52,867 --> 02:24:53,811
Yes

2003
02:24:53,901 --> 02:24:56,040
She could not have
done this without you

2004
02:24:56,300 --> 02:25:00,840
Actually if I was with her,
she couldn't have done this

2005
02:25:01,834 --> 02:25:03,472
Cheers!

2006
02:25:04,300 --> 02:25:06,871
To the longest project
of this century!

2007
02:25:08,300 --> 02:25:09,540

Hi!

2009
02:25:15,701 --> 02:25:16,679
Hi!

2010
02:25:17,933 --> 02:25:19,003
I was wondering...

2011
02:25:19,334 --> 02:25:22,338
Yes please tell me,
what were you wondering?

2012
02:25:22,534 --> 02:25:24,639
Would you be able to
live as a man for a few years?

2013
02:25:24,900 --> 02:25:25,844
Huh?

2014
02:25:27,834 --> 02:25:29,871
It's a really interesting concept,
your story

2015
02:25:31,834 --> 02:25:33,040
l-low did you come up with the idea'?

2016
02:25:35,301 --> 02:25:35,870
What's your story?

2017
02:25:37,300 --> 02:25:39,906
Do you make films too?

2018
02:25:39,967 --> 02:25:41,708
No, I make furniture...

2019
02:25:42,334 --> 02:25:44,905
tables, sofas, chairs

2020
02:25:45,667 --> 02:25:46,771
Chairs?

2021
02:25:48,367 --> 02:25:50,472
<i>Like Kursi chairs?</i>

2022
02:25:50,900 --> 02:25:52,675
<i>Chairs like Kursi</i>

2023
02:25:53,201 --> 02:25:55,203
<i>Kursi like chairs</i>

2024
02:26:32,800 --> 02:26:33,972
Dear life,

2025
02:26:34,934 --> 02:26:37,813
I know we haven't been
in touch for a while...

2026
02:26:38,867 --> 02:26:40,210
So nothing

2027
02:26:40,900 --> 02:26:42,243
Just wanted to say hi

2028
