1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,277
What is happen to this city?

2
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:09,375
Ashes here, smoke there.

3
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:11,908
Why are you so silent?

4
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:14,813
Why have smoke forced
down your throat?

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,476
Now it's the limit of endurance.

6
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:20,839
Let's bring this
reckless act to an end.

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,107
Smoking is banned
in all public places.

8
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:25,643
Violation will lead to penalty.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,611
Don't smoke.

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,179
No let anyone do.

11
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:31,747
Smoking will cost you.

12
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:37,771
Who doesn't want to be happy?

13
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:42,543
But at what price?

14
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:46,205
Smoking will cost you.

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,774
Smoking can cost you your health.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,339
And for your dear ones.

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,202
Smoking will cost you.

18
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,444
Oh, God! You are omniscient.

19
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:29,638
You know what everyone desires.

20
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:33,271
Then, why must the people
you created shout out to You?

21
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,836
To remind people like you who've
strayed to return to the path.

22
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:37,606
Here, get sober now.

23
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,771
What's this? Unsweetened
lime juice early in the morning?

24
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,336
Why don't you get me something
sweet, sugar?

25
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,175
Just forget about it
and take this.

26
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:47,043
You have to go to the
Ashram with Amit. Hurry!

27
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:48,612
This is such a pain!

28
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:51,509
Why should I hover around
the ashram since he is devoted?

29
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:55,805
I asked the maid to come early
today, but she's not here either!

30
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,436
Antara is still out jogging.

31
00:03:57,533 --> 00:04:00,173
If I have to get all of you
to the same place on time...

32
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:01,541
...it is mission impossible!

33
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:04,307
You're supposed to be a Jain caterer,
but all your behaviour is Non veg.

34
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,511
It makes me so crazy!

35
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:10,148
Please don't put on that song
again!

36
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:12,670
We must go to the Ashram with Amit.

37
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:16,573
Let's kick start the
day on a good note.

38
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,643
This is just what I need.

39
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,941
Please hurry up! Come on.
- Yes.

40
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:22,644
I'll be there.

41
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,748
"Carefree and willful."

42
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,337
"Carefree and willful."

43
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,338
"Put on a fancy turban."

44
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,677
"With the drum beat playing."

45
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,311
"Put on a fancy turban."

46
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,346
"With the drum beat playing."

47
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,643
"Come on the stage
and play the music."

48
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,941
"Keep staring at me."

49
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:04,606
"Why do you stare
when I dance?"

50
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:08,080
"Why do you stare when I dance?"

51
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:11,637
"Why do you stare when I dance?"

52
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,739
"Why do you stare when I dance?"

53
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,211
"Hey, girl!"

54
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:26,874
"When you dance,
with your long hair...

55
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:30,505
...I dance well too and
drive the girls crazy."

56
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,513
"My habit of living in style
is now the hot trend."

57
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,070
"Everyone is dancing
to my beat."

58
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:37,646
"Let's dance..."

59
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,680
"Let's dance to my beat."

60
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:41,974
Mom! Where's my kuna?

61
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,543
Your kuna? It was filthy.
It's in the wash.

62
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,509
"Keep moving to the beat."

63
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:55,676
"lam going to sing your hit song."

64
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:02,179
"Keep moving to the beat."

65
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:05,776
"lam going to sing your hit song."

66
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:09,603
"I'll make the boy
dance with me."

67
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,943
"I'll be the life of the party."

68
00:06:13,267 --> 00:06:16,305
"Come on, let's move
to the beat."

69
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:18,779
"You bring me such joy."

70
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:22,405
"Why do you stare when I dance?"

71
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,004
"Why do you stare when I dance?"

72
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,547
"Why do you stare when I dance?"

73
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,707
"Why do you stare when I dance?"

74
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:35,007
"Hey girl!"

75
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,803
"Carefree and willful."

76
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,370
"Carefree and willful."

77
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:55,074
I need chutney with the dhoklas.
Get some, please?

78
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:56,578
Forget about the chutney.

79
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:57,805
Drink this juice.

80
00:06:57,867 --> 00:07:00,040
You'll get acidity.
- Acidity, it seems.

81
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,971
Dad, don't change the topic!

82
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:04,341
Shraddha is a sweet girl.

83
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,902
She may be, I don't deny that.

84
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,377
Listen, I'm willing to accept her
as my daughter-in-law.

85
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,912
But, she has to accept me
the way I am. That's it.

86
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,009
It's not Shraddha,
her dad is the problem here.

87
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,205
Are you going to marry her dad?

88
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:21,343
His dad-in-law is in the temple
all day long, tolling the bell.

89
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,909
I didn't ask you to stay
in the temple all day long.

90
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:27,004
He should just get the feeling
we are somewhat religious.

91
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,340
Somewhat religious?

92
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:31,480
Your dad-in-law is eternally
the feet of that holy man.

93
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:33,337
I can't do that, okay?

94
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,970
Why don't you pick another girl?

95
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:36,774
Some friend of hers, maybe?
Set him up!

96
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,570
<i>Come on, dad'.
- Amâ€œ.</i>

97
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:43,745
Come fast. Bus has arrived.

98
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,876
These people should not be
allowed to stay in one's society.

99
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,177
He's rented the house and
staked claim on the entire street.

100
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,338
Hey!
- Dad I'll go and see.

101
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,073
Kick his darn car!

102
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:02,675
Ever since he's moved in
he's given all kinds of trouble.

103
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:11,446
Forget it. I bet the aristocrat is
still asleep. Get back here.

104
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,606
What the...

105
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,037
Oh, no! What did you do?

106
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,547
Another notice.

107
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,402
Amit! Come on!

108
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:25,743
If he sees, he's create a huge scene!
Come back!

109
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,543
You are pests!

110
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,879
All the devotees are kindly
requested...

111
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:03,813
...that the counters
which are set up...

112
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,609
...are providing blue water,
blue veneration materials.

113
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,807
Hail.

114
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:13,139
- I hope he doesn't renounce the world.
- I'd love that.

115
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:18,135
Look at the map.
It has all the details.

116
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,341
The Neelashram is
spread over 30 acres.

117
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,040
Dad! Dad, where are you lost?

118
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,878
The same place where you
lost yourself, son.

119
00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:40,912
Let's go.

120
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,904
Neel (Blue) water, blue...

121
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:48,879
Massage oil and Neel Ayurved?

122
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,136
Neel real estate!

123
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,738
This is 400 sqft
and that is 600 sqft.

124
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,779
Listen, why don't they come out
with a public issue?

125
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,369
Dad, please don't joke.

126
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,876
Sir, this isn't a joke.
They are thinking about it.

127
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:06,237
See?

128
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:07,839
Get out of the way!

129
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,542
Watch it.
Take care.

130
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,436
Hail Neel Baba.

131
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,111
Praised be Neel Baba.

132
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,077
Hail Neel Baba.

133
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,902
Hail Neel Baba!

134
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,107
Is it going to rain?

135
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:37,140
Rain?
No.

136
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:39,913
Why are they wearing raincoat
caps?

137
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:41,742
Dad, that's the Neel headgear.

138
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,711
These are staunch devotees
of Swamiji.

139
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,878
So staunch devotees wear a uniform.
- Yes.

140
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:50,944
Yes, tell me Hasmukh.
- Shraddha.

141
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:53,977
What? The Kachori maker?

142
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:55,375
Speak softly!

143
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:57,504
One moment, I'll call you later.

144
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,376
Dad! It's Shraddha.

145
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:03,710
Doesn't she look a bit
too old for you?

146
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:06,344
She's a better fit for me.

147
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,470
The one you're looking
at is her mom.

148
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:10,137
Shradha is behind her.
- Oh, her mom?

149
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,308
Well, the mom is pretty awesome, too.
- Hey!

150
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:15,412
She's the mom.

151
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,074
She's nice.

152
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:25,013
Swami Neelanand's grace...

153
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:27,238
...is going to spread
all over the world.

154
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:31,046
After setting up ashrams
on American land...

155
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:35,843
...Swamiji has established the Neel
family on an international level.

156
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:41,307
And he inaugurated the Neel Ayurved
center at the ashram in Bhopal.

157
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,409
The sky is...
- Blue!

158
00:11:44,467 --> 00:11:46,947
The ocean is...
- Blue!

159
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:49,843
The eyes are...
- Blue!

160
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:55,711
"Neelanand Baba."

161
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,807
"Neelanand Baba."

162
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:08,009
"Neelanand Baba."

163
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:11,947
"Neelanand Baba."

164
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,245
"The one who comes
to you, Baba..."

165
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:24,543
"The one who comes
to you, Baba..."

166
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,571
"You shower him with happiness."

167
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:32,843
"The one who comes
to you, Baba..."

168
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:37,279
"You shower him with happiness."

169
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:41,543
"Neelanand Baba."

170
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,776
"Neelanand Baba."

171
00:12:57,433 --> 00:12:59,174
Hail Neelanand Maharaj!

172
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:00,576
Hail Neelanand Swami!

173
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:02,544
Hail Lord Neelanand!

174
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:11,546
After consuming
the poison in the world

175
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,281
Lord Shiv was called Neelkanth.

176
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:22,813
I am entered this world to consume
the poison in your lives.

177
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,304
Hail Baba!
- He's a great man.

178
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:30,339
Give me poison,
I will give you joy.

179
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:35,007
Give me your poison!

180
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:37,874
Give me your poison!

181
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:40,880
Hail the Lord of Joy!
- Hail!

182
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:43,209
Hail Neelanand Maharaj!
- Hail!

183
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,338
Hail Neelanand Maharaj!
- Hail!

184
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,175
Hail Neelanand Maharaj!
- Swamiji! - Baba!

185
00:13:48,267 --> 00:13:50,144
Swamiji!
- Babaji, here! Swamiji!

186
00:13:58,367 --> 00:14:02,042
Hello, Swamiji.
- Basically, I know it all.

187
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,081
But, I'd rather hear it from you.

188
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:08,079
What is bothering you?

189
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:10,513
Swamiji, I have an MBA degree.

190
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,604
I can't really hear well.
Come closer, please.

191
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:17,277
Swamiji, I have an MBA degree.

192
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,179
I've been trying for a really
long time.

193
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:21,269
But, I can't find a job.
- Hmm.

194
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:24,470
From today, you...

195
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,873
...you will manage the operation
of my ashram.

196
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,649
The ashram needs your service.

197
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,613
What kind of service will he
get her to do? - Dad!

198
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:40,045
Thank you.
- Hail Neelanand Maharaj! - Hail!

199
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,410
Hail Neelanand Swami!
- Hail!

200
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:44,845
Hail Lord Neelanand!
- Hail!

201
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,403
Swamiji, I...
- Hey, stop!

202
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:49,708
Swamiji! Me, me, me!
- Yes, tell me.

203
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,040
Talk to me, son.
- Swamiji!

204
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,046
Swamiji, I am in big, big trouble!

205
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,876
I have been married
for eight years!

206
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,081
But I still don't have anyone
to call me dad.

207
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:02,046
Please, son out my problem.

208
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,149
From today, your worries
are my worries.

209
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:11,339
You can stop worrying.

210
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,936
Yes, Swamiji!

211
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:19,747
Hello?
What?

212
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,176
Really?

213
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,640
Really!

214
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,580
My wife is expecting!

215
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:30,738
My wife is expecting a baby!

216
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:32,976
My wife is pregnant!

217
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,603
I am going to have a baby!

218
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,374
Hail Swamiji!
- Hail!

219
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:37,571
Hail Swamiji!
- Hail!

220
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:39,374
Say it!
- Hail Swamiji! - Hail!

221
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:41,879
Well dad via satellite.

222
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,104
When you are thinking
of my image...

223
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:50,812
...when you are devoted to me...

224
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,813
...without any doubt...

225
00:15:54,867 --> 00:15:56,744
...he is my best devotee!

226
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,872
And I will certainly grace
him with the best!

227
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:02,377
Hail Swamiji!
- Hail!

228
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:04,140
"Neelanand Baba."

229
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,875
"Neelanand Baba."

230
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:12,075
"The one who truly loves you...

231
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:17,014
...and you help him in every way."

232
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:24,574
"The one who truly loves you...

233
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:29,013
...and you help him in every way."

234
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,411
"You destroy the sorrow...

235
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,606
"You destroy the sorrow...

236
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,407
"You destroy the sorrow...

237
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,573
"When someone comes
over to you, Baba...

238
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:46,082
...you shower happiness on him."

239
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:50,206
"Neelanand Baba."

240
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,407
"Neelanand Baba."

241
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,607
"Neelanand Baba."

242
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,614
"Neelanand Baba."

243
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,112
It's no big deal, dad.

244
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,510
You just have to attend prayer
meetings and perform venerations.

245
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,840
And what about some dancing?

246
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,141
That fat lady looked so funny!

247
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:23,337
Of course.

248
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:24,810
And it will be good.

249
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:27,541
At least you'll chant
the name of the Lord.

250
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,707
If I chant the name of the Lord
in the Ashram...

251
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,144
...is Neelanand going to run
my business?

252
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:34,269
Talk to the girl at least!

253
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:37,275
If her parents have any issues,
don't be scared.

254
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,943
I will get you married, okay?
- What?

255
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,543
What is he going to do? Shed
crocodile tears for a few days.

256
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:44,670
Then, they'll get back on track.
Go ahead, talk to her.

257
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,677
Shraddha won't do that.

258
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,303
Her dad is a heart patient.

259
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,902
He's a mental patient.

260
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,641
The entire community is insane.

261
00:17:52,867 --> 00:17:54,210
"Heart patient!"

262
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,442
These old folks blackmail one
for the smallest things.

263
00:17:57,633 --> 00:17:59,374
I'm a heart patient!

264
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,438
You're bound to die some day!

265
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,801
Elope with her.

266
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:05,143
Pack your bags and elope.
I will deal with the rest.

267
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,237
You don't have to create
that kind of scene.

268
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,609
The marriage will take place
with everyone's consent.

269
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:11,044
And it will be a great wedding!

270
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,043
A great wedding.

271
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,807
Anyway, your sugar levels are too high.
- What?

272
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:18,878
How is Amit's wedding connected
to my sugar levels? Tell me!

273
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:23,677
Why not? If you wake up early
and walk to the temple...

274
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:25,974
...it will be nice walk.
Right?

275
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:28,047
The sugar level
will level itself out.

276
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:31,243
Do you know why I am the top most
caterer in Ahmadabad?

277
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:34,671
Because, I taste every single
dish. Get it?

278
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:37,274
I can't do all this.

279
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:39,173
Indu, I'm leaving.

280
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:40,906
Alright, don't forget to
go to the bank today.

281
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:42,207
Why should I go to the bank?

282
00:18:42,267 --> 00:18:45,009
Baa died over two months ago!

283
00:18:45,067 --> 00:18:46,740
You still haven't
opened up her bank locker.

284
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,245
I'm sure it doesn't
contain a treasure.

285
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,370
What do you mean?
- Fine, I'll get it. Come on.

286
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:52,106
Don't forget.
- Alright, I won't.

287
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:07,705
Hey, Mr. Noticewala!

288
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,843
What is this?

289
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,403
My name is not Mr. Noticewala.

290
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:14,140
I have told you so many times!

291
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,149
My name is Nawab Mehmood
Nazeem Ali Shah Khan Bahadur.

292
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,178
Show some respect.

293
00:19:20,267 --> 00:19:22,213
I asked for your name,
not a long winded address.

294
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:23,875
Forget it!
What's going on?

295
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:25,708
Why do you keep handing out
notices for every little thing?

296
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:27,804
Why don't you park that piece of
junk to the side?

297
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,002
Junk?
-Yes!

298
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,102
This is a 1945 car!

299
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:32,202
It's a vintage car!

300
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,280
You scratched it!
Open your eyes wide and look!

301
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,370
That's what you get for parking it
in the middle of the road,

302
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,947
Listen, you could have requested
and I could have shifted it.

303
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,345
Excuse me, my son rang your
doorbell ten times!

304
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:44,406
I guess, you were sleeping.
What else?

305
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:46,346
No, I was in the washroom.

306
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:48,773
In the washroom?

307
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,147
What kind of food do
you guys eat?

308
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,508
Washroom?

309
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,541
Uncultured man!

310
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:58,838
I meant, I was in the bathroom.

311
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,607
Uncultured?

312
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,006
Do you know what jhajharu?

313
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:06,207
Jhajharu?

314
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,371
Jhajharu?
Do you know what it means?

315
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,677
Bathroom!
Right?

316
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,970
Yes, right.

317
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:16,741
But, it's not right to keep
handing out these notices.

318
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,371
I sent a bill for the repairs
with the notice.

319
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:20,707
You will have to pay that.

320
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,670
I won't pay this.

321
00:20:24,267 --> 00:20:25,803
I will never pay this!

322
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,106
What proof do you have...

323
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:29,204
...that I scratched that
junked up car of yours?

324
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,145
Want to file a case?
Go ahead!

325
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,372
Go ahead and file a lawsuit!

326
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,808
Why don't you forget it?
Let's go. - Why should I?

327
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,743
He's been issuing notices at
the slightest provocation...

328
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,074
...since 6 months!

329
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:40,204
If it's such trouble
why did you come to live here?

330
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,143
Go and live in a Muslim
locality. Go on!

331
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,146
Listen...
- Communal discrimination!

332
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,879
This is India!

333
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:49,005
Under the Constitutional
Law 295 -A...

334
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,738
...and 298...

335
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,711
...I can put you behind bars!

336
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:55,873
I am not doing to get scared of
these laws and so on!

337
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:57,606
I am not one to get scared either.
- Yes.

338
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,373
I won't get scared, either!

339
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,707
You listen to me.

340
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,905
Don't try to pull rank
since you're in a majority.

341
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,105
This is not going to
work with me.

342
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,009
I don't care what
messes you come up with...

343
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:08,808
...what issues you come up...

344
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,107
...I will get my head cut off,
but I won't bow it!

345
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,670
Now, these people can't think
beyond killing or cutting up stuff.

346
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:16,441
Why are you doing this?
You have to go to the bank.

347
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,343
Let's go!
- Crazy man. - Let's go!

348
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:19,377
Let's go! Come on!

349
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:20,946
What on earth!

350
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,537
Ms. Alka! How are you?

351
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:36,340
Sit, Mr. Dharampal.

352
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:38,135
I'm fine.

353
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:39,906
I heard about your mom.

354
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,040
Yes, well, I guess age will
have its way.

355
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,074
She was such a pleasant woman!

356
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:47,113
I still miss her.

357
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,440
She was a nice person.

358
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,477
And she really loved you, too.

359
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:56,071
No matter what we do, we
can never repay our parents.

360
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,837
Would you like some tea,
coffee, a cold drink?

361
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:00,674
No, nothing, thanks.
Just the locker, please.

362
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:02,041
Okay.
- Let's go. - Let's go.

363
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:16,673
Dad, you look exactly like grandpa.
Right?

364
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:17,939
No.

365
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,012
I think, your dad looks more
like his mom.

366
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:23,810
Don't you think so?

367
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,811
Dad seems disturbed, doesn't he?

368
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,810
Please make it tasty.
We have elite guests.

369
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:39,139
He makes kachoris.
- Hmm.

370
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,611
He's a good chef.
- Mm hmm.

371
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,111
He's been at it since
three years.

372
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:45,104
What's his name?
- Abdul Hameed.

373
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:50,080
I forgot to tell you.
There's a chef from Surat.

374
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:52,135
I have called him in, okay?
- Okay.

375
00:23:52,467 --> 00:23:54,310
Sorry, we'll call
you if we need you.

376
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:55,812
I'll call you.
- Yes, sir.

377
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,343
No use of coming here.

378
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,838
Dharam Bhai.
- Yes?

379
00:24:01,267 --> 00:24:03,247
We have an order for a huge
dinner party.

380
00:24:03,533 --> 00:24:05,843
You have to handle it for
the next few days, please.

381
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,937
Alright, as you wish.

382
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,679
Oh wow!
This is amazing.

383
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:37,645
Sethji, thank you for
the donation to our orphanage.

384
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,472
Alright, Mr. Bhatt.
Tell me. -Yes?

385
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:50,279
Can you say with complete faith
that the kids who come here...

386
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:53,109
...you don't reveal
their parents identity?

387
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,446
I am absolutely sure.

388
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,743
We have to be extremely
careful about that.

389
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:02,748
I can see lots of
old records and files.

390
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,178
It's stacked in here.
We have lots of records.

391
00:25:05,233 --> 00:25:09,375
1965, 1655, 1945, 1960.

392
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:11,674
We even have a few files
which are from pre-lndependence.

393
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:14,406
1960?
- Yes.

394
00:25:15,267 --> 00:25:17,873
1960?
- Yes.

395
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:20,773
No! How can you have 1960?

396
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:22,938
What are you saying?
Yes, we have them. - Really?

397
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,804
Do you see that cupboard
back there? - Yes.

398
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:27,746
It contains files...

399
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,802
...from 1950 to 1960.

400
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:31,812
Really? I don't believe it.

401
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:34,177
If you don't believe it,
I'll fetch them. Wait.

402
00:25:34,434 --> 00:25:36,038
Let me show you this, too.

403
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:38,341
There are loads of papers in here.

404
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,006
What's the big deal?
Look at this, please.

405
00:25:41,533 --> 00:25:45,845
1955, 1956, 1958.

406
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,776
50...where's 60? Where's 1960?

407
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:52,805
Sethji, 1960!

408
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,779
1960.
- Sir, there are men here,

409
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:56,937
not computers.

410
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,002
You press a button and it
says, file not found.

411
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,204
1960...

412
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,312
What immaculate records!

413
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:10,273
What happened?
- It's a secret.

414
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:12,142
It's secret!
- That's nice.

415
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,304
It's secret.

416
00:26:13,367 --> 00:26:15,711
No, but...
- No, but it's secret.

417
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:18,475
I want to see it.
What are you doing?

418
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:20,103
Hey, let go!

419
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,211
Shailesh, Bhupesh, Nimesh, Aakash!

420
00:26:22,534 --> 00:26:24,138
That file is top secret!
Catch him!

421
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,679
Don't let him go!

422
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:30,308
Hey, let go!

423
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:31,869
Oh, God!
- What?

424
00:26:33,267 --> 00:26:36,180
Break the window!
It's top secret! - Get back!

425
00:26:36,267 --> 00:26:37,905
What is this?
Sethji!

426
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:40,345
Sethji! Give me the file!

427
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,346
Give me the file!

428
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,402
Sethji! Please listen to me.

429
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,877
Listen... nab him!

430
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:47,810
Nab him!

431
00:26:48,467 --> 00:26:50,344
Hey! Shut the door!
- Get back!

432
00:26:50,867 --> 00:26:53,814
Praveen! Catch him!
What did he eat for breakfast?

433
00:26:54,534 --> 00:26:56,673
Don't let him get out of here!
Stop him!

434
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,340
Open the door!

435
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,236
Sethji!
<i>'</i> open Up!

436
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,803
Sethji! Get out or
I will drag you out.

437
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,272
Sethji!

438
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,473
Sethji! Open the door.

439
00:27:13,534 --> 00:27:15,070
Sethji, open the door.
- How does it matter?

440
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,705
What are you doing?
- Sethji, please.

441
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,708
Please!

442
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:31,740
Meer Saukhat Ali.

443
00:27:32,534 --> 00:27:34,309
Muslim!

444
00:27:36,233 --> 00:27:37,337
Muslim!

445
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:14,207
Remember!

446
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,871
What is true, is right.

447
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,106
What is this, God?

448
00:29:41,533 --> 00:29:43,376
Why did you create this mess?

449
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,507
This is a major disaster!

450
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,179
You created me a Muslim...

451
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:49,769
...and had me raised as a Hindu?

452
00:29:50,933 --> 00:29:53,379
And You've chosen to reveal
the suspense today! Today?

453
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:55,578
Fifty years after the event!

454
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,577
Did You forget I am a Brahmin?
Here, look at this.

455
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,711
Look at this!
A Brahmin.

456
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:05,969
Yes, I've eaten eggs.

457
00:30:06,267 --> 00:30:07,541
I have eaten chickens
and so on.

458
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,874
I have drunk liquor too.

459
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,773
That... that's a hobby.

460
00:30:10,933 --> 00:30:12,776
I like that.
It's not what I was taught.

461
00:30:12,934 --> 00:30:14,379
My values were that of
a Brahmin.

462
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,575
But, this is a huge punishment!

463
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:20,374
You've just gone ahead and
made me a Muslim!

464
00:30:20,967 --> 00:30:22,105
A Muslim!

465
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:24,937
You could have made me
something else!

466
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:27,871
God, listen to me.

467
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:32,214
You just say that this is
all a dream, okay?

468
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:34,811
But, I will atone for all the sins
I have committed!

469
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,345
Here, take that!
That's for you.

470
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,538
Alright?
Enough?

471
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,381
But, You are going
to say that this is a dream.

472
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,206
A bad dream.

473
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,106
Alright?

474
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:50,577
I know, Yourjustice is delayed,
never denied.

475
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:52,812
I will be waiting outside.

476
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,543
I don't mind waiting.

477
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,173
But, just do all this today
if You don't mind.

478
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,840
Hello.

479
00:31:31,067 --> 00:31:32,341
Remember!

480
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:34,640
That which is right is true!

481
00:31:36,933 --> 00:31:38,708
What happened?
Why are you shouting?

482
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,643
What happened?

483
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:44,239
What?

484
00:31:46,767 --> 00:31:47,905
Punditji.

485
00:31:49,633 --> 00:31:53,513
If I am true, then why am I not
right?

486
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,146
I don't get it.
Just explain it to me.

487
00:31:59,033 --> 00:32:00,740
What can I say to you?

488
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:04,378
I am ruined.

489
00:32:05,233 --> 00:32:07,270
I am doomed.
- What?

490
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:11,407
I am sure, it was a
characterless debauch!

491
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:15,175
He satiated his lust...

492
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,338
...and tossed me at
someone else's door.

493
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,674
Oh, Lord!

494
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:20,872
What kind of sinners
are being born, now?

495
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:23,012
They don't spare young girls.

496
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,736
They hound the old ladies.

497
00:32:24,967 --> 00:32:27,277
And this is the limit!

498
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:30,607
I mean, they didn't even spare
a man of your age! - What?

499
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:34,246
What are you imagining?
- No! You did the right thing.

500
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,602
You have come to Lord Shiva.
Here's what I will do.

501
00:32:36,767 --> 00:32:38,678
I will go inside and
get a Panchmukhi Rudraksha.

502
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:40,337
You have wear it around your neck.

503
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,006
That will heal you and
set you right, too.

504
00:32:43,067 --> 00:32:44,808
I'll be right back.

505
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,577
Where is it?

506
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,541
Indu? What are you looking for?

507
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,443
Allah!
- What?

508
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,174
I'm looking for my key ring.
Why? - The key ring.

509
00:33:00,267 --> 00:33:02,178
Dad!
- Yes.

510
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:05,508
Who gave this?
- Allah sent it.

511
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,680
What?
- Bhalla sent it.

512
00:33:07,733 --> 00:33:09,337
It's Mr. Bhalla's advance.

513
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:11,012
It's a dinner order for
a hundred people.

514
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,410
Why didn't you say it's Bhalla?
Alright.

515
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:55,340
"Who created me?"

516
00:33:57,633 --> 00:34:02,241
"My shadow questions me."

517
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,043
"I am lost,
whether I exist or not."

518
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:18,478
"My soul is in agony,
let me see you."

519
00:34:18,733 --> 00:34:25,673
"Oh, Lord, take away this pain."

520
00:34:25,767 --> 00:34:27,576
"Oh, Lord."

521
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:32,074
"Oh, Lord."

522
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:35,774
"Tell me, who I am."

523
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:39,440
"You are God and the
Almighty."

524
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,242
"Oh, Lord."

525
00:34:47,367 --> 00:34:48,573
lndu.

526
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:52,672
My life is completely
messed up.

527
00:34:55,467 --> 00:34:58,141
I wish I hadn't opened
Baa's locker.

528
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:05,406
You know, the one who
adopted me...

529
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,012
No, no...

530
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:16,116
"Where did I come from?"

531
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,780
"Who am I truly?"

532
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,645
"I think at every moment."

533
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:38,217
"I see that I am torn."

534
00:35:39,434 --> 00:35:46,977
"My prayer is silenced
in the noise."

535
00:35:47,034 --> 00:35:50,709
"My soul cries out."

536
00:35:50,767 --> 00:35:54,146
"Let me see you."

537
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,609
"Heal my sorrow."

538
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,238
"Oh, Lord."

539
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,473
"Oh, Lord."

540
00:36:03,534 --> 00:36:04,706
lndu.

541
00:36:05,967 --> 00:36:09,744
L...was born in a Muslim family.

542
00:36:11,967 --> 00:36:15,676
I am a Muslim by birth!

543
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,077
Bomb blast in Pune.
Today evening, in Vishrantwadi...

544
00:36:21,134 --> 00:36:24,274
lndu...
- These people are going too far.

545
00:36:24,534 --> 00:36:26,104
What happened?
- Watch this!

546
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:28,306
I don't know what these
Muslim folks want!

547
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:31,211
These people are instrumental in
doing everything wrong!

548
00:36:31,267 --> 00:36:34,646
Even in the police station 8 out
of 10 wanted guys are Muslims!

549
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,608
Whyjust 8 out of 10?
- ...person has...

550
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:38,874
10 out of 10 are Muslims!
What are you talking about?

551
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:41,208
The Opposition Leader
Mr. Kulkarni believes...

552
00:36:41,267 --> 00:36:43,941
...that this is orchestrated
by a Muslim group.

553
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:55,005
What about this incident?

554
00:36:56,634 --> 00:36:57,908
Yes.

555
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:00,010
I didn't do this.

556
00:37:01,434 --> 00:37:02,708
I didn't do this, either.

557
00:37:03,867 --> 00:37:05,710
But, we are being blamed for it.

558
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:09,579
Yes, but I am not
responsible for it.

559
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:13,239
Then who is responsible
for blaming us?

560
00:37:14,767 --> 00:37:17,008
If there is any bomb
blast in any place...

561
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,511
...or a terrorist attack...

562
00:37:18,567 --> 00:37:20,638
...we are accused at once.

563
00:37:21,834 --> 00:37:24,576
They never take a good
look at themselves.

564
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,979
Can I say something?

565
00:37:27,034 --> 00:37:29,378
I understood your mentality...

566
00:37:29,434 --> 00:37:33,109
...the day you asked me
to shift into a Muslim locality.

567
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,106
Panditji, don't mind, but I want
to ask you something.

568
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,574
Why do you people hate
us so virulently...

569
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,913
...right from your birth?

570
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:56,510
Mehmood Bhai, I am a Muslim, too.

571
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,573
Bhai, do you realize what
you are saying?

572
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:08,569
I was born a Muslim.

573
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:11,277
Really.

574
00:38:13,867 --> 00:38:15,642
What are you going
to do about this, now?

575
00:38:16,634 --> 00:38:19,444
Are you going to broadcast it?
Will you tell everybody?

576
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,646
Will you stick it up on
the notice board?

577
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:43,911
Get in.
- Why?

578
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,138
Is it because I am a Muslim?

579
00:38:46,434 --> 00:38:49,142
No, because you are hassled.

580
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,508
Tell me.
What's the matter?

581
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,209
Giving up one's own child!
One's own child!

582
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:22,480
If you didn't want the responsibility
then why have a child?

583
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,976
If in future you find out...

584
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,843
...that you were born in a Muslim
family...

585
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,504
...won't you be disturbed?

586
00:39:33,567 --> 00:39:35,274
I was born a Muslim.

587
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,305
I mean, you find out that...

588
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,381
...you were born in a Hindu
family, won't it bother you?

589
00:39:42,734 --> 00:39:44,270
Won't you feel disturbed?

590
00:39:46,034 --> 00:39:47,308
I get it.

591
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,507
I just want to find out
who was my dad.

592
00:39:53,367 --> 00:39:56,109
What is the name of
your biological father?

593
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,645
Meer Shaukat Ali.

594
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,038
Meer Shaukat Ali.

595
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:01,878
You are right.

596
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,977
Biological father.

597
00:40:05,634 --> 00:40:06,908
That's correct.

598
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,241
He's not my dad, he gave
birth to me and abandoned me!

599
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,643
How can he be my dad?

600
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,875
Biological father!

601
00:40:12,967 --> 00:40:14,207
That's right.

602
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,811
By tomorrow evening...

603
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,006
...can it be done?
Can you find out?

604
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:24,971
I'll try my level best.

605
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:28,010
I will try.

606
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,202
No, not at four, meet me
at six o'clock, tomorrow. - Oh!

607
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,075
Don't move.
- What is it?

608
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,037
You look good.

609
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:40,568
Flatterer.

610
00:40:40,634 --> 00:40:43,410
We will go to Himachal for
our honeymoon.

611
00:40:43,467 --> 00:40:45,913
Besides, it's horribly hot
here in June.

612
00:40:46,134 --> 00:40:48,478
We can go on a honeymoon
if we get married, first.

613
00:40:48,567 --> 00:40:49,875
Don't worry, Shraddha.

614
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:52,573
Just let me train dad
a bit, and after that...

615
00:40:52,634 --> 00:40:54,443
Yes, but hurry up, Amit!

616
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,480
You know Uncle Vyas wants...

617
00:40:56,534 --> 00:40:58,741
...his son to marry as soon
as possible!

618
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,704
And dad is also...

619
00:41:00,767 --> 00:41:04,010
He said, the day of appearance
is 2 weeks away and on that day...

620
00:41:04,367 --> 00:41:06,005
Shraddha, don't get tense.

621
00:41:06,334 --> 00:41:08,177
I have found something, today...

622
00:41:08,234 --> 00:41:09,907
...which will put dad in
a good mood.

623
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,243
It's a very old, very rare
clip from Manchala (film).

624
00:41:12,334 --> 00:41:13,711
Okay, very good.

625
00:41:14,067 --> 00:41:15,410
Now, just be quick...

626
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,535
...and get him around...
- I think, dad is here.

627
00:41:16,634 --> 00:41:18,204
Let me have him meet you too.

628
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,506
Dad!
Shraddha is online.

629
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,440
You're flirting online, too?
Nice.

630
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,170
Hello, dear.
- Hello, Uncle.

631
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,177
My dear, I'm not that kind of
orthodox father-in-law.

632
00:41:34,234 --> 00:41:36,339
Tell her, she has to be
free and uninhibited.

633
00:41:36,434 --> 00:41:38,573
Just be free.
- Yes.

634
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:41,373
But, Uncle, these are our
values.

635
00:41:41,434 --> 00:41:46,110
My dear, you are too young to get
caught up in the values' tangle.

636
00:41:46,467 --> 00:41:48,708
Both of you love each other, right?

637
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:50,041
Yes.
- You love each other, right?

638
00:41:50,367 --> 00:41:51,937
That's settled then!

639
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,707
And you know what they say...

640
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:56,839
...if the couple is willing, what will
Neelanand be able to do about it?

641
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,902
That's all very well, Uncle,
but...

642
00:42:00,967 --> 00:42:03,447
...I don't want to hassle my dad.

643
00:42:03,834 --> 00:42:06,644
Why can't you be a bit religious?
It's really simple.

644
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,237
Just pray a bit.

645
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,577
Apply the tilak (sect marking)
and wear a cap. That's all.

646
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:15,170
Well, if you kids want me to
wear a cap, I'll do that too.

647
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:16,940
Alright, then, we'll meet.

648
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,274
Okay. - Bye, dear.
- Okay, bye.

649
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:19,903
Bye, Uncle.
- Okay. - Hail Neelanand.

650
00:42:19,967 --> 00:42:21,105
Hail Neelanand.

651
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:24,512
If the girl says bye,
say bye darling, say, bye love.

652
00:42:24,567 --> 00:42:26,342
Why are you saying Neelanand?

653
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,943
If you do this at the
wedding night...

654
00:42:29,034 --> 00:42:31,412
...then, she'll grow a beard
and become an ascetic. Get it?

655
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,174
Come on, dad! That is ridiculous.
- "Come on, dad!"

656
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:36,578
Dad.
- Yes.

657
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:39,546
I found a very rare, very old
clip of Manchala.

658
00:42:39,633 --> 00:42:41,078
What are you talking about?
- Yes.

659
00:42:41,133 --> 00:42:42,339
And you are telling me this, now?

660
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,110
"I'm the Sardar (leader) of
Bhangra, do you know, baby?"

661
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,670
"It's unending, do you know, baby?"

662
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,111
What's going on, dad?

663
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,942
In those days, Manchala...

664
00:42:54,033 --> 00:42:56,343
...was accused of trafficking
while conducting foreign tours.

665
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,311
That when this clip was taken.

666
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,812
He was an amazing singer.

667
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,470
I wonder where he is?

668
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,506
What is this?

669
00:43:04,867 --> 00:43:05,937
Dad!
_ Yes?

670
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,480
I took life membership of the
Neel Parivar (family) today.

671
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,680
They gave me a ten percent
discount.

672
00:43:10,767 --> 00:43:13,873
Besides, they gave me
the Neel granth free.

673
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:15,742
Wow.
- We must read this and obey it.

674
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,370
Obey it.

675
00:43:17,867 --> 00:43:20,438
The Neel Parivar's book is blue.

676
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,377
Does your Baba watch blue (adult)
films, too?

677
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:23,707
Dad!

678
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,507
Here.
Get your act together.

679
00:43:36,967 --> 00:43:38,207
Yes, Dharam Bhai.

680
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,678
Any news of the man
who created me?

681
00:43:40,767 --> 00:43:42,769
I have put some of my men
on the job.

682
00:43:42,867 --> 00:43:44,312
All of us are doing
our best, to find out.

683
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:46,574
God willing, we will know
soon enough.

684
00:43:46,967 --> 00:43:49,277
Okay, listen, let's meet
at home, tonight.

685
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,979
That's enough!

686
00:44:27,367 --> 00:44:28,573
Drink up.

687
00:44:28,634 --> 00:44:30,773
Mehmood Bhai? In Ahmadabad?

688
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,905
I have a permit.
- In that case, cheers.

689
00:44:37,567 --> 00:44:38,637
What is it?

690
00:44:40,367 --> 00:44:42,210
Is this Scotch?
- Yes.

691
00:44:42,767 --> 00:44:44,508
It's orange flavored.

692
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,637
I'll give you some that's lemon
flavored the next time you visit.

693
00:44:49,934 --> 00:44:51,504
Did you find out what happened?

694
00:44:53,034 --> 00:44:54,172
Your Muslim dad?

695
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:56,942
Not my dad, my biological father.

696
00:44:57,034 --> 00:44:58,911
Okay, cool down!

697
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,237
Let me tell you a story.

698
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,376
Listen, Dharam Bhai.

699
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:05,975
Your dad isn't...

700
00:45:06,334 --> 00:45:08,644
...what you think he is.

701
00:45:11,067 --> 00:45:12,478
What do you mean?

702
00:45:12,634 --> 00:45:15,410
I have a friend.
Dr. Farooque.

703
00:45:15,467 --> 00:45:17,777
Coincidentally,
he knows your father.

704
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,837
He was telling me that
your father...

705
00:45:21,034 --> 00:45:23,947
...was admitted to his clinic
a couple of times.

706
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,477
And according to Dr. Farooque...

707
00:45:26,867 --> 00:45:30,246
...your father is a very good man.

708
00:45:31,067 --> 00:45:33,570
When you were an infant...

709
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,473
...your mother expired.

710
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,570
In those days, your father
had a financial crisis at home.

711
00:45:41,567 --> 00:45:44,776
Later, he got hired
as a driver in Kuwait.

712
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,742
That's why, he had to leave.

713
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,971
He was helpless and so
he forced himself...

714
00:45:53,067 --> 00:45:56,105
...to hand you over to a relative.
He went to Kuwait.

715
00:45:57,767 --> 00:46:02,182
The custodian of the child
began to find it a burden.

716
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:05,375
That's when the relative
took the child...

717
00:46:05,734 --> 00:46:09,079
...that is you, and handed
you over to the orphanage.

718
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:15,083
Four years later, when your father
came back from Kuwait...

719
00:46:15,467 --> 00:46:18,311
...he found out about all this.

720
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,476
God knows, how he felt
at that time.

721
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:26,405
He went to the orphanage,
searching for you.

722
00:46:26,967 --> 00:46:30,847
But, Mr. Trivedi
had adopted you by then.

723
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:34,580
The authorities didn't even tell
him who the adoptive parents were.

724
00:46:34,767 --> 00:46:36,713
He was really traumatized.

725
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,010
Due to that sorrow,
he didn't even marry again.

726
00:46:42,067 --> 00:46:46,709
I believe, he has donated all
his worldly goods to charity.

727
00:46:46,867 --> 00:46:50,838
And these days, he is in the Khwaja
Garib Nawaz sanatorium...

728
00:46:51,167 --> 00:46:53,613
...at Sarkhej, living out
the last days of his life.

729
00:46:54,634 --> 00:46:57,706
Oh, God! Your story is
like a movie!

730
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,339
Alright, please wait.

731
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,411
Here he is.

732
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,412
Dad!
- What are you doing?

733
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,104
You will make me a sinner!

734
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,236
This is taboo.

735
00:47:14,267 --> 00:47:15,803
I am not your father.

736
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,379
Why are you calling me dad?

737
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,904
No, brother, he told me that...

738
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:25,177
I know. I understand
your feelings.

739
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:27,113
Come on.
I will explain it.

740
00:47:27,467 --> 00:47:31,210
Now, Meer Shaukat Ali is over 80
by the grace of God.

741
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,938
He's 80 years old?
- By the grace of God.

742
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,410
May God grant him
a long life, but...

743
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,447
...at present, he is not too well.

744
00:47:38,534 --> 00:47:39,979
That's why I am saying that...

745
00:47:40,034 --> 00:47:42,036
That is what I am saying too,
brother.

746
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:44,338
You see, a man who...

747
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,244
...has lived his entire life
chanting the name of God...

748
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:51,045
...and if he meets his only
son in the last days of his life...

749
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,172
...and he finds out his son
is not a Muslim.

750
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,406
Just think of how shocked
he will be!

751
00:47:57,467 --> 00:47:59,879
He will be terribly upset.
Right?

752
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,479
So, you mean, I can't meet him?
-You can meet him.

753
00:48:03,534 --> 00:48:05,480
Yes. -You can meet him.
I didn't say that.

754
00:48:05,567 --> 00:48:06,545
<i>Okay'</i>

755
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,774
But, I would like you to meet
him in a way that...

756
00:48:09,867 --> 00:48:12,108
...he feels happy.

757
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,945
He must not regret it.

758
00:48:14,033 --> 00:48:16,377
He should breathe his last
with pride.

759
00:48:16,467 --> 00:48:18,538
He must not die due to the shock.
Do you understand?

760
00:48:19,634 --> 00:48:22,046
Come this way.
- So, how can I meet him?

761
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:24,442
As a good Muslim.

762
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,712
You do know what a good Muslim
is like.

763
00:48:28,267 --> 00:48:30,304
Yes. What is a Muslim like?

764
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,708
They have long beards
up to here.

765
00:48:31,767 --> 00:48:33,303
They hitch up their trousers.

766
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,936
They have black marks on their
forehead and..

767
00:48:35,034 --> 00:48:36,707
Oh, God! May the Lord have mercy!

768
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,574
That means, you really don't know
anything about Muslims.

769
00:48:41,367 --> 00:48:43,506
Come along.
That's why I was telling you...

770
00:48:43,567 --> 00:48:46,514
...you should find out
all about Muslims...

771
00:48:46,567 --> 00:48:48,103
...and then come back here.

772
00:48:48,167 --> 00:48:50,443
God willing, you can meet
your father, then.

773
00:48:50,734 --> 00:48:52,042
Can't I just meet him?

774
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,046
I'll tell him that I am a Muslim.

775
00:48:54,133 --> 00:48:56,636
And that my name is Wasim Akram.

776
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,312
Or, Nawaz Sharif.
- You're lying in the abode of God.

777
00:48:59,734 --> 00:49:01,145
And in front of a clergyman!

778
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,907
Let's have some other name.

779
00:49:02,967 --> 00:49:06,244
First of all, it is not Nawaj,
it is Nawaz.

780
00:49:06,567 --> 00:49:08,513
Nawaz?
- Yes, Nawaz.

781
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,106
N awaz.

782
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,305
So, you can leave.
Learn the ways and customs.

783
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,380
Get some information.

784
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,680
And, then you can meet your
father.

785
00:49:18,134 --> 00:49:19,306
Good bye.

786
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,972
N awaz.

787
00:49:25,867 --> 00:49:27,107
N awaz.

788
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,836
Wretched clergyman!

789
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,038
He wants to make you a Muslim.

790
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,577
Don't worry.

791
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:41,580
This is your legal and fundamental
right to meet your father.

792
00:49:43,567 --> 00:49:45,410
I'll draft out a notice to him.

793
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,140
Under Section 340.
He'll get back on track at once.

794
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,441
Please don't issue any notice.

795
00:49:50,534 --> 00:49:52,571
Or everyone will notice me.

796
00:49:53,967 --> 00:49:58,109
If people find out that I was
born a Muslim...

797
00:49:58,733 --> 00:50:01,304
...then, that's the end of it.
I'll become a social outcast.

798
00:50:01,367 --> 00:50:03,005
The kids aren't married yet.

799
00:50:05,133 --> 00:50:09,138
Whatever has to be done has
to be done on the sly.

800
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,108
I wouldn't have scaled the wall and
come over at midnight, otherwise.

801
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,602
So, you will become a Muslim.

802
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:18,169
It really doesn't make
any difference to me.

803
00:50:18,234 --> 00:50:21,113
Make me a Muslim,
make me a wrestler or whatever.

804
00:50:21,767 --> 00:50:24,407
That's the very least I can do to
meet my dad.

805
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:27,340
Tell me something.

806
00:50:27,834 --> 00:50:30,940
You never met your father,
you've never seen him.

807
00:50:30,967 --> 00:50:32,310
There has been no connection.

808
00:50:32,367 --> 00:50:35,780
Why are you longing
to meet him?

809
00:50:39,634 --> 00:50:41,580
I want to see...

810
00:50:42,434 --> 00:50:45,574
...what is a father like?

811
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,342
I was four years old,
when my dad died.

812
00:50:50,067 --> 00:50:51,512
I have never seen him.

813
00:50:53,167 --> 00:50:55,238
Forget about that,
and just tell me something.

814
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,179
These Muslims ways and customs...

815
00:50:58,667 --> 00:51:00,510
...I mean, saying the prayers
and whatever.

816
00:51:01,033 --> 00:51:03,377
Rituals, customs, traditions,
call it what you will.

817
00:51:03,767 --> 00:51:06,247
Teach me that.
Okay?

818
00:51:06,634 --> 00:51:08,375
That's it, then!
- Marhaba!

819
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,637
What?
- Marhaba!

820
00:51:13,034 --> 00:51:14,274
Marhaba?

821
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,641
Cheers! Marhaba.
- Cheers.

822
00:51:22,867 --> 00:51:24,938
Here's the cap.

823
00:51:27,967 --> 00:51:29,537
Amazing.

824
00:51:30,234 --> 00:51:32,544
You look like a born Muslim.

825
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,906
Teach me the ways and customs
of a born Muslim.

826
00:51:36,967 --> 00:51:39,641
Then, I'll fit the bill to a T.

827
00:51:39,734 --> 00:51:42,374
Hold. Let me take a picture.

828
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:47,176
Keep the chin up. Smile now.
Yes, pleasant.

829
00:51:49,233 --> 00:51:50,735
Are we done?
- Done. - Yes?

830
00:51:50,834 --> 00:51:52,074
Be seated, please.

831
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,544
What should I do?
- That means, sit down.

832
00:51:56,334 --> 00:51:57,972
I'm sitting down.

833
00:51:58,034 --> 00:52:00,071
Tell me.
- Bismillah.

834
00:52:00,934 --> 00:52:03,608
So, let us begin
with the greeting.

835
00:52:03,767 --> 00:52:05,110
What is that?

836
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,111
I meant the greeting.

837
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,406
The greeting?
- Yes.

838
00:52:08,467 --> 00:52:09,810
What is that?
- Greeting.

839
00:52:09,867 --> 00:52:11,244
Greeting.
- Yes.

840
00:52:11,633 --> 00:52:12,976
Oh!

841
00:52:13,034 --> 00:52:15,014
Salam alaikum.
- Oh...

842
00:52:15,067 --> 00:52:17,104
That's where the best people
go wrong.

843
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:18,703
It's not salam alaikum.
- Then what?

844
00:52:18,767 --> 00:52:20,178
It's assalam alaikum.

845
00:52:20,234 --> 00:52:21,713
Assalam alaikum.

846
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,212
When you say that,
you get an answer...

847
00:52:24,267 --> 00:52:26,110
What?
- Walekum assalaam.

848
00:52:26,467 --> 00:52:28,777
Assalam alaikum
is turned the other way around?

849
00:52:28,834 --> 00:52:30,074
It's what we do.

850
00:52:30,167 --> 00:52:32,306
Namaste, and namaste back.
Ram Ram, and Ram Ram back.

851
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,971
Why does this get turned
the other way around?

852
00:52:35,034 --> 00:52:38,015
That means, peace be upon you.

853
00:52:38,067 --> 00:52:40,343
Yes.
- So, you get a return greeting.

854
00:52:40,433 --> 00:52:42,310
Which means, peace be upon you too.

855
00:52:43,367 --> 00:52:45,369
So you have to return it.
- Yes.

856
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,474
Alright.

857
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,872
Should we get on in life, or
are greetings all there is to it?

858
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:55,113
Pronounce life, the correct way.

859
00:52:55,534 --> 00:52:57,514
Why? If I don't will it shorten
my life?

860
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,012
Say it right!

861
00:53:41,067 --> 00:53:42,944
Where were you since so long?

862
00:53:44,033 --> 00:53:46,775
I was walking.

863
00:53:48,567 --> 00:53:50,012
Walking?
- Yes.

864
00:53:50,467 --> 00:53:51,810
At one in the morning?

865
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,372
Well, I have acidity.

866
00:53:53,433 --> 00:53:54,776
The doctor told me
after eating...

867
00:53:54,867 --> 00:53:56,778
Tell me the truth.

868
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,746
Where did you go
and who were you with?

869
00:53:59,867 --> 00:54:01,369
I was with Mehmood.

870
00:54:01,467 --> 00:54:02,673
What? Mehmood?

871
00:54:03,767 --> 00:54:06,179
Mehmood? I was with the ghost!

872
00:54:06,267 --> 00:54:09,510
I was with the ghost.
- Stop joking, please.

873
00:54:09,967 --> 00:54:11,310
What about your clothes?

874
00:54:13,867 --> 00:54:17,679
Yes, I slipped a bit
while walking.

875
00:54:17,767 --> 00:54:19,440
You're not hiding something
from me, right?

876
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,379
What can I hide from you, darling?
- Then, swear to me.

877
00:54:22,833 --> 00:54:24,471
I swear to you.

878
00:54:24,834 --> 00:54:29,283
Darling, men change
as they age.

879
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,010
I went to get a surprise for you.

880
00:54:33,067 --> 00:54:34,774
I climbed the tree
and I slipped.

881
00:54:40,067 --> 00:54:42,638
You always convince me
with a surprise. - See?

882
00:54:42,867 --> 00:54:44,540
Now, go on.
- Yes.

883
00:54:45,667 --> 00:54:47,305
And, listen.
- Yes?

884
00:54:47,667 --> 00:54:49,874
I will also give you a
surprise, tomorrow morning.

885
00:54:50,234 --> 00:54:51,645
Really?

886
00:54:52,933 --> 00:54:54,742
<i>O</i> kaY-
<i>O</i> kaY-

887
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:02,573
Drink up the juice.
- Where is the surprise?

888
00:55:03,734 --> 00:55:07,045
This isn't a surprise.
This is Neelanand's cap.

889
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,977
Dad, the surprise is a bit late.

890
00:55:09,034 --> 00:55:11,275
This is not a cap, this is the
Neel headgear.

891
00:55:11,367 --> 00:55:12,846
It's worn
so you can look religious.

892
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:16,279
It's an easy way to look religious.

893
00:55:16,334 --> 00:55:19,042
No prayers, or reading the texts.
No sacred duty or meditation.

894
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,580
Wear the cap and become religious
in an instant.

895
00:55:21,634 --> 00:55:23,705
How do I look?
Do I look religious?

896
00:55:23,767 --> 00:55:25,440
Do I look like a Pundit (priest)?

897
00:55:25,934 --> 00:55:28,676
How can I look like one?
My face is non religious!

898
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,041
This is amazing.

899
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:33,172
No matter what the religion
they make you wear the cap.

900
00:55:34,667 --> 00:55:36,874
Who is it?
- I think, the priest is here.

901
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:38,605
The priest?

902
00:55:38,667 --> 00:55:40,613
That's the surprise.
- What?

903
00:55:41,267 --> 00:55:45,113
Amit would like you to learn
about religion from the priest.

904
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,469
It will be useful, when you have
to meet Swamiji.

905
00:55:47,533 --> 00:55:49,240
Listen to me...
- It's okay.

906
00:55:49,734 --> 00:55:53,375
Oh, God! This is a terrible
surprise.

907
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:57,382
Aren't you the same man?
I am true, but not right.

908
00:55:57,434 --> 00:56:00,574
No! Don't misunderstand.

909
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:03,147
I am true and I am right!

910
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:06,238
I am fine, all over. Everywhere.
- Yes.

911
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:10,973
Om.
-Om.

912
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,738
So, let's start with the first lesson.
Say, Shree Ganeshay Namah.

913
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,245
Shree Ganeshay Namah.

914
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,939
First, we must
perform the cleansing.

915
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,209
So, you need to close your eyes
and nose and drink this. Go on.

916
00:56:26,267 --> 00:56:27,769
What is this?
- Drink it up.

917
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,805
What is that?
- It's cow urine.

918
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,712
Cow urine?
- Yes.

919
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,207
It's essential to cleanse
your inner soul.

920
00:56:40,767 --> 00:56:43,714
If you go out and eat anything else,
you must cleanse yourself, again.

921
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,376
Come on, focus.
Say after me.

922
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,579
Om.
-Om...

923
00:56:49,934 --> 00:56:51,811
Now, we will perform Wazu.
- Wazu.

924
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,471
Cleaning, as in ablutions.
- I saw it on the CD.

925
00:56:54,533 --> 00:56:56,740
Yes! How is it to be done?

926
00:56:57,067 --> 00:57:00,844
Rinse the mouth, cleaning of
mouth and face.

927
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,744
And then, the arms.
- Like that.

928
00:57:03,933 --> 00:57:05,674
The prayer mat has been set out.

929
00:57:05,734 --> 00:57:10,046
Place both hands behind
your ears, like this.

930
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,039
Alright?
Then...

931
00:57:15,934 --> 00:57:17,311
...do this.

932
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,746
This is called the intention
to pray.

933
00:57:19,933 --> 00:57:21,913
The intention to pray.
- Yes.

934
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:26,278
(Arabic prayers)

935
00:57:28,634 --> 00:57:30,636
(Arabic prayers)

936
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:37,507
(Arabic prayers)

937
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,542
Dad, why are you looking
at them so intently?

938
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,380
I am just looking at how
he does that.

939
00:57:47,834 --> 00:57:49,040
The prayers?

940
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:51,135
Yes, that's right. The prayers,
the veneration. The ritual.

941
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:53,043
I wanted to see how they
perform it.

942
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,180
Come on, sit.
Let me drop you to college.

943
00:57:55,267 --> 00:57:57,713
Dad, it is 6 in the evening...

944
00:57:57,934 --> 00:57:59,538
College is out.

945
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,479
I am going to go home.
- That's what I said. Sit.

946
00:58:02,567 --> 00:58:04,103
Come on.

947
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,875
(Arabic prayers)

948
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,008
I can't do this.

949
00:58:12,934 --> 00:58:15,972
I can't do this. It's fine right up
to the intention to pray.

950
00:58:16,033 --> 00:58:18,980
But, saying the words is hard.

951
00:58:19,034 --> 00:58:20,775
No, you can do it!
You can do it.

952
00:58:20,867 --> 00:58:22,540
What you have to do is...

953
00:58:22,633 --> 00:58:24,271
...when you are standing
in the mosque...

954
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:28,076
...then, you follow
what the man before you does.

955
00:58:28,867 --> 00:58:30,175
Follow the leader.

956
00:58:30,767 --> 00:58:32,075
Follow.
- Follow.

957
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,978
Now go down like this.
Don't stop.

958
00:58:35,034 --> 00:58:37,776
Nothing to be said, right?
- No, nothing!

959
00:58:38,767 --> 00:58:41,373
Hey! What are you doing?
- What?

960
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,210
It's really dusty, I'm
getting rid of it.

961
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:47,240
It's all so dusty!

962
00:58:47,534 --> 00:58:49,514
I just don't understand him, now.

963
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,880
You know those fakirs
who carry peacock feathers?

964
00:58:54,967 --> 00:58:57,243
They throw up the clouds of
loban (frankincense) smoke.

965
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,639
What should I do about them?
Touch their feet?

966
00:58:59,734 --> 00:59:01,111
No!

967
00:59:01,434 --> 00:59:04,608
Islam forbids it.
You can't touch someone's feet.

968
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,702
You don't bow down to anyone.

969
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,704
But, if you feel an intense
desire...

970
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,807
...then, you must greet
the person first.

971
00:59:13,334 --> 00:59:14,540
And then...

972
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,737
...you may kiss the person's hand.

973
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:18,512
What do you mean?

974
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,805
I mean, you kiss.

975
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,436
Kiss! Then why don't you
say that?

976
00:59:23,534 --> 00:59:25,639
Why are you making it
sound so heavy?

977
00:59:25,734 --> 00:59:27,407
That's how it is said.

978
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,241
Here, you hold the hand like this.

979
00:59:29,334 --> 00:59:31,905
Yes, right!
- Kissing. - Kiss it.

980
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,204
Hello.
- Salamalaikum.

981
00:59:34,533 --> 00:59:35,910
Salam.

982
00:59:36,634 --> 00:59:38,113
Greetings.
- Greetings.

983
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:39,737
Greetings.
- Yes.

984
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,575
Do come in.
- Come in.

985
00:59:42,367 --> 00:59:44,847
Repeat after me.
As you stride along..

986
00:59:45,134 --> 00:59:46,807
You walk the world...

987
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:47,970
Listen carefully.

988
00:59:48,034 --> 00:59:49,638
As you stride along...

989
00:59:49,734 --> 00:59:51,111
As you walk...

990
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:53,613
As you stride along,
lighting up the path...

991
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:54,974
Lighting up the...

992
00:59:55,067 --> 00:59:56,444
Lighting...

993
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:00,973
Joseph and...

994
01:00:02,967 --> 01:00:04,378
What is this tongue twister?

995
01:00:05,567 --> 01:00:07,478
Say it right!

996
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,576
Tongue twister.
- Tongue twister.

997
01:00:10,634 --> 01:00:12,136
This is just a waste of time.

998
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:14,180
No! You did it again!

999
01:00:14,234 --> 01:00:17,340
You have to enunciate right.

1000
01:00:17,767 --> 01:00:20,748
Alright.
- Like that.

1001
01:00:20,967 --> 01:00:23,345
That's it.
- Okay.

1002
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,239
Repeat after me. Resident
of Kailash and Kashi...

1003
01:00:27,167 --> 01:00:28,612
Resident of Khailash
and Khashi...

1004
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:30,112
What's wrong with your throat?

1005
01:00:30,534 --> 01:00:33,777
Say it clearly,
enunciate properly.

1006
01:00:33,833 --> 01:00:36,177
Don't pronounce it with Kh.
- Kh...

1007
01:00:36,367 --> 01:00:39,541
K...the residents of Kailash
and Kashi. - Kailash..

1008
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,739
And go down on the knees.
- No speaking, right?

1009
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,041
No! On your knees.

1010
01:00:44,134 --> 01:00:46,580
Bend, bow.

1011
01:00:47,267 --> 01:00:51,443
Look, this is the complete
bow. Do this.

1012
01:00:53,267 --> 01:00:54,837
What are you doing?

1013
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,402
This is the standing bow.

1014
01:00:56,467 --> 01:00:57,969
Bow as you stand.

1015
01:00:58,067 --> 01:00:59,478
I am standing on my legs
and I'm bowing.

1016
01:00:59,534 --> 01:01:01,172
A standing bow.

1017
01:01:01,267 --> 01:01:02,974
Why don't you read it?

1018
01:01:04,867 --> 01:01:07,143
When Joseph and his comrades...

1019
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,107
When Joseph and his comrades...

1020
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,043
...left the ship to
embark on the island...

1021
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:13,307
...the cruel Jalaal stood there
leering...

1022
01:01:13,367 --> 01:01:14,937
...while standing
tied up in chains.

1023
01:01:16,467 --> 01:01:18,140
That's a lot of emphasis.

1024
01:01:18,234 --> 01:01:19,474
Doesn't it hurt your throat?

1025
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,535
A drink!

1026
01:01:21,633 --> 01:01:24,113
Striding along,
lighting up the path...

1027
01:01:24,167 --> 01:01:27,080
Lighting...

1028
01:01:27,134 --> 01:01:28,772
Sir, please pay attention first.
- Yes.

1029
01:01:28,867 --> 01:01:30,107
Striding along, lighting up
the path.

1030
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:31,475
Striding along...

1031
01:01:31,534 --> 01:01:33,775
Striding along,
lighting up the path.

1032
01:01:33,867 --> 01:01:36,473
Brandishing the trident
and the crescent moon...

1033
01:01:36,533 --> 01:01:38,410
Don't chatter.
Don't talk nonsense.

1034
01:01:38,467 --> 01:01:41,175
Go and wash your face in a
dirty water canal.

1035
01:01:41,233 --> 01:01:43,736
What are you...
I'm going. - Get going!

1036
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:45,745
Get going!
- I'm leaving. - Dharam!

1037
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,507
I am leaving.

1038
01:01:47,567 --> 01:01:50,741
I will never come back!
He's insane!

1039
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,576
Hello, may I speak
to Dr. Chunnawala?

1040
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,573
Yes, from your
psychiatry department.

1041
01:02:25,833 --> 01:02:28,575
Get back a bit.
Scoot back!

1042
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:34,772
Sir, please move a bit forward.

1043
01:02:35,367 --> 01:02:36,573
A bit more.

1044
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,011
Here you are.

1045
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,070
Eat it.

1046
01:02:57,167 --> 01:03:00,011
I am being religious for you.
Eat up. - No.

1047
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:03,113
You promise like a politician and
forget it, later.

1048
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:05,477
What did I forget? - You haven't
been to the ashram since two days.

1049
01:03:05,567 --> 01:03:07,478
My son, I have to go to the
market early in the morning.

1050
01:03:07,567 --> 01:03:09,706
You can't get fresh produce
after 9 AM.

1051
01:03:09,767 --> 01:03:10,905
No, it's an excuse.

1052
01:03:10,967 --> 01:03:12,378
Come with me to the ashram
today.

1053
01:03:12,467 --> 01:03:13,741
Neeleshwarji will be there.

1054
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,041
At least greet him.
Baba!

1055
01:03:16,134 --> 01:03:19,445
Listen! - He must see
you attend the veneration.

1056
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:22,112
Higher.
- Wait till the veneration is complete.

1057
01:03:22,167 --> 01:03:24,238
Please?
- That's right!

1058
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:26,778
That's right.
Keep it right there.

1059
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,446
Hello?
- Assalam alaikum.

1060
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,844
I am calling from the Khwaja Garib
Nawaz sanatorium. - Yes.

1061
01:03:33,934 --> 01:03:36,915
I thought, I should tell you
your dad is unwell.

1062
01:03:37,267 --> 01:03:39,406
What do you mean?
- He's critical"

1063
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,440
You mean, he is really ill.
- Yes, he is.

1064
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,141
Then, I will come there, Ali Bhai.
- No, listen to me.

1065
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,907
Yes?
- Come during prayers.

1066
01:03:46,967 --> 01:03:48,503
He should not find out.

1067
01:03:48,567 --> 01:03:50,046
He won't know.

1068
01:03:50,367 --> 01:03:52,005
What is it?
- What?

1069
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,104
It's a call from the shop.

1070
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,677
So, you're not staying for
the veneration?

1071
01:03:55,767 --> 01:03:57,872
I will attend the
evening veneration, okay?

1072
01:03:57,934 --> 01:03:59,379
Dad, is there any problem?

1073
01:03:59,467 --> 01:04:01,743
It's nothing, it's just
about the business.

1074
01:04:02,033 --> 01:04:03,569
Why don't you go?

1075
01:04:03,667 --> 01:04:06,978
That's right.
Keep it right there.

1076
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:07,580
Listen, Lord, I am at your abode.

1077
01:05:08,334 --> 01:05:13,079
At least let me meet my dad, now.
Please? Atleast once.

1078
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,979
Salam alaikum.

1079
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:28,945
Walaikum salam.

1080
01:05:29,034 --> 01:05:30,445
Shame on you!

1081
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,980
How could you be so rude
while praying?

1082
01:05:33,034 --> 01:05:34,707
You lied in the abode of the Lord!

1083
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:35,972
Get him out of here, right now.

1084
01:05:36,034 --> 01:05:38,480
Listen to me, my dad
doesn't have much time.

1085
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:40,513
Let me meet him.
- The law is the law.

1086
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,602
A non Muslim can't go in
and that's that.

1087
01:05:42,667 --> 01:05:44,647
Take him away!
- You know I am a Muslim.

1088
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,008
I am a born Muslim.

1089
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,774
Sir, you know it.
Sir...

1090
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,038
lam a Muslim, sir!
- Come on.

1091
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,040
Alright, fine.

1092
01:06:25,867 --> 01:06:28,040
Amit, what are you saying?
- Mom, it's true!

1093
01:06:28,134 --> 01:06:29,613
I saw Dad myself.

1094
01:06:29,667 --> 01:06:32,671
He was standing outside the mosque
amongst the Muslims wearing the cap.

1095
01:06:32,734 --> 01:06:35,271
For the sake of my father
and my son...

1096
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:37,278
...and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

1097
01:06:37,367 --> 01:06:40,871
Oh, God, forgive them, for they
know not what I do.

1098
01:06:41,734 --> 01:06:43,077
What is going on, Dharam?

1099
01:06:43,134 --> 01:06:45,774
Amit said, you went to the mosque.

1100
01:06:45,834 --> 01:06:47,575
And you were behaving
like a proper Muslim!

1101
01:06:47,667 --> 01:06:50,147
I even went to church.
He didn't see that.

1102
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:54,104
Jesus never fails.
But, has he passed?

1103
01:06:54,167 --> 01:06:56,204
Dad, why are you doing this?

1104
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,779
For the sake of my father,
my son and the Holy Spirit, dear.

1105
01:06:59,834 --> 01:07:03,839
I would like to ask God, Allah,
the Almighty.

1106
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:07,143
If you are one,
why are there so many variations?

1107
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,009
Why these different
departments?

1108
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,936
Due to your identification...

1109
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,276
...competition has been
caused in your creation.

1110
01:07:13,367 --> 01:07:15,745
I want solution for this confusion.

1111
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,610
Please! Please, give me a
solution... - Listen!

1112
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:20,340
...to this confusion!
Please!

1113
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,006
This is an action or an opinion of
an inadequate reason.

1114
01:07:23,067 --> 01:07:24,569
And this is all
because of you, Amit.

1115
01:07:24,667 --> 01:07:26,772
Ever since you forced him to
be religious...

1116
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:28,210
...dad has become like this.

1117
01:07:28,267 --> 01:07:29,746
I talked to Dr. Chunawala.

1118
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,007
He said, just leave him alone.
It will be alright.

1119
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:34,205
So, just stop harassing him.

1120
01:07:35,867 --> 01:07:38,108
Hail Lord Shiva.

1121
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,743
Come, sister.

1122
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,512
Your horoscope is excellent.

1123
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:45,814
But, there is some unrest
at present.

1124
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:49,372
Saturn has adversely
aspected the seventh house.

1125
01:07:49,434 --> 01:07:52,381
So, you could have problems with
your husband.

1126
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:55,273
What kind of problems, priest?

1127
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,204
Please explain.

1128
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,805
I mean, is it work, money...
- Sister...

1129
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:01,710
...there are other spheres
apart from these.

1130
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,279
Such as the sphere
of moral character.

1131
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:05,745
Character?

1132
01:08:06,267 --> 01:08:08,247
Are you saying,
there's another woman?

1133
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:09,643
Hail Lord Shiva!

1134
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,237
Another woman?
Or perhaps another...

1135
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,812
The trouble is in the
seventh house.

1136
01:08:15,867 --> 01:08:17,972
The problem is, that
being a man, the first house...

1137
01:08:18,067 --> 01:08:20,069
...he is involved
with a male planet.

1138
01:08:20,134 --> 01:08:22,614
Don't ask me any more
and put me in a moral dilemma.

1139
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,412
In fact, focus on your
husband's...

1140
01:08:25,467 --> 01:08:27,208
...strange behavior.

1141
01:08:28,467 --> 01:08:31,744
Priest, can't anything be done
about this?

1142
01:08:32,267 --> 01:08:33,541
Listen.

1143
01:08:34,834 --> 01:08:37,075
I have stopped solving
such problems, these days.

1144
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:39,147
Alright, then.
Bless you.

1145
01:09:20,034 --> 01:09:21,377
What are you looking at?

1146
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,647
I am doing something important.
You won't understand.

1147
01:09:25,967 --> 01:09:27,640
I know it very well!

1148
01:09:27,734 --> 01:09:29,839
What's going on with you
and Mehmood.

1149
01:09:29,933 --> 01:09:31,344
I know all about it.

1150
01:09:32,967 --> 01:09:34,378
Who told you?

1151
01:09:34,934 --> 01:09:36,607
What has to be said about that?

1152
01:09:36,667 --> 01:09:38,305
Can't I see it?

1153
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:42,212
I have watched you scale
the wall to disgrace yourself.

1154
01:09:43,634 --> 01:09:46,478
Indu, I was going
to tell you, but...

1155
01:09:46,934 --> 01:09:48,845
How could I tell you?

1156
01:09:49,767 --> 01:09:51,246
Oh, Goddess!

1157
01:09:52,667 --> 01:09:54,476
Why did this happen to me?

1158
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:57,010
Why was I fated to deal
with this?

1159
01:09:57,867 --> 01:09:59,244
Go away.

1160
01:09:59,334 --> 01:10:00,779
Leave and go to Mehmood!

1161
01:10:00,834 --> 01:10:03,371
You like him, right?
Just go to him.

1162
01:10:04,234 --> 01:10:07,545
What? I like Mehmood?

1163
01:10:10,234 --> 01:10:11,975
Are you insane?

1164
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:13,973
What do you mean, I like him?

1165
01:10:14,167 --> 01:10:16,238
I am not gay, you fool!

1166
01:10:16,967 --> 01:10:20,073
I am straight, straight
as an arrow.

1167
01:10:20,567 --> 01:10:22,843
Why do go to meet him
on the sly, then?

1168
01:10:23,267 --> 01:10:24,405
For you.

1169
01:10:24,467 --> 01:10:26,242
To Mehmod's place?
- Yes.

1170
01:10:26,634 --> 01:10:30,207
We are going to celebrate our 25th
wedding anniversary after a week.

1171
01:10:30,934 --> 01:10:34,279
I want to take you on a honeymoon.

1172
01:10:34,367 --> 01:10:37,007
It will be even more awesome
than the first time around.

1173
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:41,412
Why do you have to visit
Mehmood at home for that?

1174
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,741
I have to!

1175
01:10:44,834 --> 01:10:48,179
He has some Yunani medicines.

1176
01:10:48,234 --> 01:10:50,771
It adds to a man's vitality.
Okay?

1177
01:10:50,934 --> 01:10:53,005
Yes, so, you could go about
it the regular way.

1178
01:10:53,267 --> 01:10:56,111
Why scale the wall?
- I wanted to surprise you!

1179
01:10:56,167 --> 01:10:59,171
To surprise you,
I'd scale his wall...

1180
01:10:59,267 --> 01:11:01,907
...as well as the Great
Wall of China, too!

1181
01:11:02,501 --> 01:11:04,606
Swear to me.
- It's true.

1182
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:06,543
I want proof.
- Don't believe me?

1183
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,308
Promise me.
- One moment.

1184
01:11:12,567 --> 01:11:16,379
First, use and then believe it.
Come along.

1185
01:11:18,501 --> 01:11:19,878
Don't laugh!

1186
01:11:19,934 --> 01:11:21,914
It was a narrow escape.

1187
01:11:23,234 --> 01:11:24,907
Once the Maulvi agrees...

1188
01:11:24,967 --> 01:11:27,709
...I will meet my dad
and this charade will stop.

1189
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,247
You overruled my idea of
going to court.

1190
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:35,076
If you hadn't done that,
that wretched clergyman...

1191
01:11:35,134 --> 01:11:36,943
...would have been set right
in no time.

1192
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,536
What do you think?

1193
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,547
Am I ready to meet him?
- Yes.

1194
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:46,276
Your Muslim customs,
formalities, etiquettes, life...

1195
01:11:46,334 --> 01:11:49,110
...have I imbibed all of that?

1196
01:11:49,167 --> 01:11:51,113
You're alight.
- Okay.

1197
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:54,010
But, don't pronounce etiquettes
with a slur.

1198
01:11:57,701 --> 01:12:00,113
What is this?
- ...to celebrate the aqiqah...

1199
01:12:00,167 --> 01:12:02,340
Great! He is my client.

1200
01:12:02,434 --> 01:12:04,505
Mr. Akbar Zariwala.

1201
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,080
It is an invite to an aqiqah
(ritual after child's birth).

1202
01:12:07,334 --> 01:12:08,369
Come with me.

1203
01:12:08,467 --> 01:12:11,311
It's experience on the ground
and you will learn from it.

1204
01:12:11,601 --> 01:12:13,137
What's an aqiqah?

1205
01:12:13,234 --> 01:12:15,646
You will know, when you get there.

1206
01:12:16,967 --> 01:12:19,846
Don't get me into trouble.
- No! Aqiqah.

1207
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,071
Aqiqah,
<i>'</i> Aqiqah,

1208
01:12:22,267 --> 01:12:24,611
Aqiqah!
Forget it.

1209
01:12:24,867 --> 01:12:26,608
Salam alaikum.
How are you?

1210
01:12:26,667 --> 01:12:28,510
You've arranged everything
very well. - Yes.

1211
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,077
I believe you've opened
a new shop.

1212
01:12:31,667 --> 01:12:33,305
God has been kind.

1213
01:12:33,467 --> 01:12:35,003
Did you hear about Rafique?

1214
01:12:35,067 --> 01:12:36,944
Where is your aunt?

1215
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:40,042
Amazing!
- Thank you.

1216
01:12:40,334 --> 01:12:42,109
Assalam alaikum.
- Walaikum salam.

1217
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,474
All well?

1218
01:12:43,534 --> 01:12:45,844
Salam alaikum, Sir.
- Walaikum salam. All well?

1219
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:46,970
God is kind.
- Alright.

1220
01:12:47,034 --> 01:12:48,877
This is a special friend of mine.

1221
01:12:48,934 --> 01:12:50,072
A very close and dear friend.

1222
01:12:50,167 --> 01:12:52,010
Do take very good care of him.

1223
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:53,512
Of course.

1224
01:12:53,601 --> 01:12:54,875
This is Ejaz.
- Hello.

1225
01:12:54,934 --> 01:12:56,379
This is Sahir.

1226
01:12:58,134 --> 01:12:59,670
I will be back.
- Hello.

1227
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:00,776
I'll be right back.

1228
01:13:01,767 --> 01:13:03,940
So, Sir...
- Hello, ma'am.

1229
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,378
Kids these days ask the most
weird questions.

1230
01:13:06,434 --> 01:13:09,005
It is difficult to answer them.
- Yes.

1231
01:13:09,434 --> 01:13:12,904
Just yesterday my son was
saying...

1232
01:13:12,967 --> 01:13:15,675
...that, if you can't perform Wazu...

1233
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:17,269
...will the prayer be accepted?

1234
01:13:17,367 --> 01:13:19,347
Now tell me, what should I say?

1235
01:13:28,867 --> 01:13:30,972
It hurts to sit like this.

1236
01:13:31,801 --> 01:13:36,079
No, those who find it tough to sit
in this posture...

1237
01:13:36,134 --> 01:13:38,705
...they have another option.
Yes.

1238
01:13:38,767 --> 01:13:41,270
They can sit on a chair
and perform their prayers.

1239
01:13:41,367 --> 01:13:43,574
The intention has to be pure.
- Right.

1240
01:13:44,767 --> 01:13:48,943
You can perform prayers
while sitting in a chair.

1241
01:13:49,534 --> 01:13:51,138
What?
- Yes.

1242
01:13:51,201 --> 01:13:53,181
Make sure your intentions
are good.

1243
01:13:53,234 --> 01:13:55,407
If you are good, then
anything is good for you.

1244
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,206
Wonderful!
- Well said.

1245
01:13:58,300 --> 01:13:59,973
Amazing.
- You bet.

1246
01:14:01,534 --> 01:14:04,572
I don't know you.
lam Shahzeb Khan.

1247
01:14:04,667 --> 01:14:06,510
What's your good name?

1248
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:08,738
Sharif Khan.

1249
01:14:09,801 --> 01:14:12,543
You seem to be wise and
learned man.

1250
01:14:12,634 --> 01:14:15,513
Tell me, is it a sin to
grow one's hair?

1251
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,104
Mom!

1252
01:14:24,701 --> 01:14:26,942
What does your mom
say about this?

1253
01:14:29,467 --> 01:14:32,471
She says, if it is 0k, so be it.

1254
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:34,980
Because, heaven is at her feet.

1255
01:14:35,067 --> 01:14:38,344
Wonderful!
- Well said.

1256
01:14:38,601 --> 01:14:40,080
Sir, tell me.

1257
01:14:40,134 --> 01:14:42,614
Which is the true path to heaven?

1258
01:14:44,767 --> 01:14:46,110
Where do you live?

1259
01:14:46,434 --> 01:14:48,812
There is a road which goes
left from Kalawar...

1260
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:51,107
...that's the road
to my humble abode.

1261
01:14:51,167 --> 01:14:54,910
That's it,
that's the road to heaven.

1262
01:14:55,534 --> 01:14:59,004
The road to your home
is the road to heaven.

1263
01:14:59,067 --> 01:15:02,207
Well said!
- Wonderful! - Great!

1264
01:15:02,267 --> 01:15:03,905
Amazing.
- Come this way.

1265
01:15:04,001 --> 01:15:06,038
Sir, this is my wife.

1266
01:15:06,301 --> 01:15:07,837
This is our dear princess.

1267
01:15:08,134 --> 01:15:09,477
Bless her, please.

1268
01:15:10,934 --> 01:15:12,504
How can I bless her?

1269
01:15:14,134 --> 01:15:17,980
Yes! What's true is right.

1270
01:15:18,734 --> 01:15:20,338
Well said!
- Amazing.

1271
01:15:20,434 --> 01:15:22,539
What is true is right.

1272
01:15:22,634 --> 01:15:24,409
Amazing, well said.

1273
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:27,072
Come, let's have dinner.

1274
01:15:27,134 --> 01:15:28,875
Let's begin with God's grace,
don't say let's eat.

1275
01:15:28,934 --> 01:15:31,881
Beautiful!
- This way, please.

1276
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:33,446
Come along.
- This way.

1277
01:15:37,934 --> 01:15:41,040
The beard is off.
You're happy.

1278
01:15:41,734 --> 01:15:44,408
But, I swear, at the party...

1279
01:15:44,501 --> 01:15:47,141
...you were the
center of attraction.

1280
01:15:47,567 --> 01:15:49,240
God saved me.

1281
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,070
Tell me something.

1282
01:15:51,434 --> 01:15:53,539
You left me with strangers.

1283
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,477
Why were you chasing that lady?

1284
01:15:55,534 --> 01:15:57,878
No! Don't get me wrong.

1285
01:15:58,067 --> 01:16:00,570
She's not a stranger.
- Who is she, then?

1286
01:16:01,234 --> 01:16:04,238
She is my wife.
She left me to stay with her family.

1287
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:06,744
God! I am sorry.

1288
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,575
I had no idea.
Sorry.

1289
01:16:09,734 --> 01:16:12,544
Do you think,
I will pass this test?

1290
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:16,207
Of course!
You were amazing.

1291
01:16:16,267 --> 01:16:19,612
If you can repeat it for that
wretched clergyman...

1292
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:21,340
...we will win the battle.

1293
01:16:22,034 --> 01:16:23,377
Say amen to that.

1294
01:16:23,634 --> 01:16:25,045
Amen.
- Amen to that.

1295
01:16:33,534 --> 01:16:37,346
<i>Zia-uhhaq...</i>

1296
01:16:38,467 --> 01:16:39,878
Mehmood.
- Yes.

1297
01:16:41,534 --> 01:16:43,172
Hello.

1298
01:16:43,934 --> 01:16:45,845
Hello.
- Hello.

1299
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:47,277
Sit down, please.

1300
01:16:47,534 --> 01:16:48,808
Sir.

1301
01:16:50,601 --> 01:16:52,774
Tell me.
-Sir...

1302
01:16:53,334 --> 01:16:58,750
...I am Mehmood Nazeem
Ali Shah Khan Bahadur.

1303
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:00,101
Wonderful.

1304
01:17:00,167 --> 01:17:03,671
I am connected to the royal family
of the kingdom of Junagadh.

1305
01:17:03,767 --> 01:17:05,178
That is wonderful.

1306
01:17:05,467 --> 01:17:08,004
Dharampal Trivedi
is my dear friend.

1307
01:17:08,101 --> 01:17:09,136
Hello.
- Sit.

1308
01:17:09,201 --> 01:17:12,307
By a mere coincidence,
your president...

1309
01:17:12,734 --> 01:17:16,011
...Saeed lmtiaz Hussein is also
my dear friend.

1310
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,207
We were just playing polo the day
before yesterday.

1311
01:17:18,267 --> 01:17:19,974
For God's sake.

1312
01:17:20,667 --> 01:17:24,308
He passed away two years ago.

1313
01:17:25,067 --> 01:17:27,547
It's an old plaque, you see?

1314
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:30,508
May God grant him heavenly peace.

1315
01:17:30,767 --> 01:17:32,974
He still visits me in dreams.

1316
01:17:33,067 --> 01:17:36,344
I was playing polo with him
in my dreams yesterday.

1317
01:17:41,467 --> 01:17:47,179
Sir, I am a complete Muslim, now.

1318
01:17:47,667 --> 01:17:50,011
My friend has been
very dedicated...

1319
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,273
...and embraced Islam.

1320
01:17:53,367 --> 01:17:56,348
But, don't worry.
I will find out in my own way.

1321
01:17:56,734 --> 01:17:57,940
Of course.

1322
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,311
I am sure, you know the
five must dos for Muslims.

1323
01:18:02,134 --> 01:18:03,807
Five?
- Duties?

1324
01:18:03,867 --> 01:18:05,403
Five, yes.

1325
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:10,209
The Kalma.
- Very good.

1326
01:18:10,867 --> 01:18:12,244
Namaz.

1327
01:18:14,867 --> 01:18:16,141
Roza.

1328
01:18:16,934 --> 01:18:18,242
Jakaat.

1329
01:18:18,734 --> 01:18:19,906
Haj.

1330
01:18:19,967 --> 01:18:21,947
Five. Haj.
- Very good!

1331
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,240
Well done.

1332
01:18:24,067 --> 01:18:25,705
Recite the first Kalma, please.

1333
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:28,947
(Arabic prayers)

1334
01:18:29,401 --> 01:18:30,903
The first Kalma.
- Go for it.

1335
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,310
Yes, no problem.
It's been said. - The Kalma.

1336
01:18:33,634 --> 01:18:37,639
Keep reciting the Kalma
and don't bother about the results.

1337
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,437
But I am worried.

1338
01:18:41,234 --> 01:18:42,679
About your father.

1339
01:18:43,301 --> 01:18:45,508
You may leave.
Good bye.

1340
01:18:45,934 --> 01:18:48,278
What are you saying?
- Yes.

1341
01:18:48,334 --> 01:18:50,314
Yes, this is wrong.

1342
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,437
This is very wrong!
It's a crime.

1343
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,639
No one can be forced...

1344
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,338
...to become a Muslim!

1345
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,175
Mehmood!
- This has to be said.

1346
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:01,477
A son has every right to meet
his father.

1347
01:19:01,567 --> 01:19:03,569
Mehmood!
-And if you steal his right...

1348
01:19:03,634 --> 01:19:06,342
...then, under section 239
of the Indian Penal Code...

1349
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,175
Mehmood! Stop!
- ...and section 340...

1350
01:19:08,234 --> 01:19:10,145
...you could be dragged to court
for this.

1351
01:19:11,334 --> 01:19:13,143
Really? So you brought
your lawyer with you.

1352
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:14,572
No, we are old friends.

1353
01:19:14,634 --> 01:19:16,671
Mehmood Nazeem Ali Shah
etc, etc...

1354
01:19:16,767 --> 01:19:18,440
...whatever your name is,
you are a lawyer.

1355
01:19:18,534 --> 01:19:19,808
Yes, Sir.

1356
01:19:20,067 --> 01:19:22,069
Take him to court and let him fight
for his rights.

1357
01:19:22,167 --> 01:19:24,943
No! I... - But, by the time
the hearing comes up...

1358
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,209
...your father will
be dead and gone.

1359
01:19:30,067 --> 01:19:31,842
Sit down! Let me speak.

1360
01:19:33,167 --> 01:19:35,204
Don't listen to him.

1361
01:19:35,834 --> 01:19:38,678
Just let me meet my father...

1362
01:19:38,767 --> 01:19:40,405
...let me meet my dad.

1363
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:41,843
Good bye.

1364
01:19:51,734 --> 01:19:53,543
He won't give in easily.

1365
01:19:54,034 --> 01:19:57,481
Let's do one thing.
Sign a legal affidavit.

1366
01:19:57,567 --> 01:19:59,069
I will handle the rest of it.

1367
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:03,905
You'll see, within two days...

1368
01:20:03,967 --> 01:20:05,173
...your dad and he...

1369
01:20:05,234 --> 01:20:07,373
...will land up at your doorstep.

1370
01:20:07,467 --> 01:20:08,571
I promise you...

1371
01:20:08,634 --> 01:20:11,046
...I will change my name
if I can't. - No!

1372
01:20:11,601 --> 01:20:14,411
I have heard you say your name
a thousand times, enough!

1373
01:20:15,167 --> 01:20:18,376
I told you, I don't
want to go to court.

1374
01:20:20,234 --> 01:20:22,407
This is all your fault.

1375
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,775
Because of me?
- You bet!

1376
01:20:25,134 --> 01:20:27,774
If you weren't rude to him,
we wouldn't be in this situation.

1377
01:20:28,167 --> 01:20:30,078
Are you fighting with me over that
wretched clergyman?

1378
01:20:30,167 --> 01:20:31,737
With your friend?

1379
01:20:31,934 --> 01:20:35,780
This is too much! I have done
so much for your friendship.

1380
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,914
I taught you, out of my love
for you. I tutored you.

1381
01:20:39,967 --> 01:20:41,605
I mentored you and you?

1382
01:20:41,701 --> 01:20:44,011
An immature friend
is a pain in the neck.

1383
01:20:45,101 --> 01:20:46,808
With a friend like you...

1384
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:49,039
...who needs enemies?

1385
01:20:49,234 --> 01:20:51,077
Great!

1386
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,775
Cheat! Traitor!

1387
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:57,579
What happened?
- Get out.

1388
01:20:58,567 --> 01:20:59,910
What?

1389
01:21:01,067 --> 01:21:02,808
Out here?
- Yes, here.

1390
01:21:02,867 --> 01:21:04,346
Right here, right now.

1391
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,941
He's back on track.

1392
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,343
He betrayed me.

1393
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:15,213
And how? In the middle of the road,
outside the city limits.

1394
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,870
My grandma was right!

1395
01:21:16,934 --> 01:21:19,005
You people can't
be loyal to anyone!

1396
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:21,671
And you people can't
be grateful to anyone.

1397
01:21:21,767 --> 01:21:23,041
You people are ungrateful!

1398
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:25,944
Your clan is treacherous, it runs
in your blood.

1399
01:21:26,167 --> 01:21:29,774
All the wars in the world
boil down to you!

1400
01:21:30,034 --> 01:21:32,378
Whether it is Hindus,
Christians, or Jews.

1401
01:21:32,467 --> 01:21:33,969
It doesn't matter who the
other party is...

1402
01:21:34,034 --> 01:21:36,105
...the first party is always
your people!

1403
01:21:37,234 --> 01:21:39,111
You have no idea...

1404
01:21:39,434 --> 01:21:41,607
...what problems a minority
community faces?

1405
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:43,077
Minority.

1406
01:21:43,434 --> 01:21:46,677
When you don't get your rights,
it sets off a fire.

1407
01:21:47,267 --> 01:21:48,678
You can't get homes.

1408
01:21:48,734 --> 01:21:50,111
You can't find jobs.

1409
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,976
Every other person considers
us to be terrorists.

1410
01:21:53,067 --> 01:21:54,375
Why?

1411
01:21:54,467 --> 01:21:56,811
Didn't we...

1412
01:21:57,034 --> 01:21:59,036
...participate in building
this country...

1413
01:21:59,134 --> 01:22:01,614
...and in setting it free?

1414
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:04,204
How can we prove that
we are patriotic, too?

1415
01:22:04,267 --> 01:22:06,042
To challenge that...

1416
01:22:06,134 --> 01:22:08,637
...I came alone, to live
in your colony.

1417
01:22:08,701 --> 01:22:10,544
And if I had not been a lawyer,
I swear to God...

1418
01:22:10,634 --> 01:22:13,410
...you would have thrown me
out, with dishonor!

1419
01:22:13,867 --> 01:22:17,076
Not onto the highway, or out of
the city but, out of this country!

1420
01:22:18,467 --> 01:22:19,810
Good bye.

1421
01:22:37,867 --> 01:22:39,141
What's the matter?

1422
01:22:39,401 --> 01:22:40,539
Shraddha!

1423
01:22:42,201 --> 01:22:45,876
Amit, why do you keep calling me
to check on the lighting?

1424
01:22:46,167 --> 01:22:48,010
I really miss you.

1425
01:22:48,267 --> 01:22:50,269
It's no use, now.

1426
01:22:50,734 --> 01:22:52,179
It's too late.

1427
01:22:53,467 --> 01:22:54,775
What happened?

1428
01:22:56,267 --> 01:22:59,339
Amit, I tried to stop Dad.

1429
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,074
But, you've been dithering so much!

1430
01:23:02,134 --> 01:23:04,136
You wasted a lot of time.

1431
01:23:05,134 --> 01:23:07,512
Now, Vyas Uncle has convinced dad.

1432
01:23:09,301 --> 01:23:12,475
I am going to marry Vivek, Amit.

1433
01:23:15,334 --> 01:23:19,305
And dad is going to announce
it on the day of appearance.

1434
01:23:21,767 --> 01:23:24,179
So, forget about me.
- It's not possible!

1435
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:25,908
I will die!

1436
01:23:26,734 --> 01:23:29,476
I turned religious
for you, but, dad?

1437
01:23:30,867 --> 01:23:33,347
I don't know what he
is always up to.

1438
01:23:35,534 --> 01:23:38,174
I am going to kill myself.
- Please, Amit.

1439
01:23:38,967 --> 01:23:40,275
Shraddha!

1440
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:45,603
Only a miracle will help us to get
married, now.

1441
01:23:50,334 --> 01:23:51,506
A miracle?

1442
01:23:51,567 --> 01:23:55,014
Come close to the screen, devotees.

1443
01:23:55,067 --> 01:23:57,946
Neelanand Swami has a special
message...

1444
01:23:58,034 --> 01:24:00,412
...which is going to be telecast.
- Hail!

1445
01:24:00,467 --> 01:24:02,538
Hail Neelanand Maharaj!
- Hail!

1446
01:24:02,634 --> 01:24:04,875
Hail Neelanand Maharaj!
- Hail!

1447
01:24:05,267 --> 01:24:08,874
I am really sad...

1448
01:24:08,934 --> 01:24:12,108
...to inform you...

1449
01:24:12,367 --> 01:24:17,544
...that, yesterday in Hyderabad
outside a mosque...

1450
01:24:18,067 --> 01:24:22,277
...some Muslims beat up two of
the Neel servitors.

1451
01:24:22,667 --> 01:24:23,338
What?

1452
01:24:23,434 --> 01:24:28,076
They burnt their headgear.
- Burnt it? Oh, God!

1453
01:24:28,134 --> 01:24:33,140
I will ensure that the
culprits are punished.

1454
01:24:34,267 --> 01:24:38,215
All the devotees should...

1455
01:24:38,267 --> 01:24:44,115
...protest peacefully outside the
District Administrator's office.

1456
01:24:44,201 --> 01:24:46,442
I command you to do so!

1457
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:53,609
Today, religion is in a crisis.

1458
01:24:53,667 --> 01:24:56,443
It is calling to you.

1459
01:24:56,534 --> 01:24:59,674
If you don't protect
your religion today...

1460
01:24:59,767 --> 01:25:02,976
...then, your existence
will be destroyed.

1461
01:25:03,034 --> 01:25:07,005
Go and show them what
we are capable of.

1462
01:25:07,234 --> 01:25:10,613
Show them, what we are capable of.

1463
01:25:10,667 --> 01:25:13,944
The one who combats Neelanand...
- Will be crushed!

1464
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,641
The one who combats Neelanand...
- Will be crushed!

1465
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:25,975
Oh, God.

1466
01:25:29,234 --> 01:25:31,475
Oh, God.

1467
01:25:34,601 --> 01:25:36,274
Salam.

1468
01:25:37,467 --> 01:25:40,880
Dad! - One moment, I'm in
the washroom. I'll be there.

1469
01:25:42,267 --> 01:25:44,975
Dad, I have had enough.
- Yes, it is enough.

1470
01:25:45,034 --> 01:25:48,140
What is too much?
- Whatever is too much!

1471
01:25:48,201 --> 01:25:50,545
Stop joking! What kind of a man
are you?

1472
01:25:50,767 --> 01:25:53,077
I am wondering
about that myself.

1473
01:25:53,167 --> 01:25:54,578
You don't care about me.

1474
01:25:54,634 --> 01:25:56,079
Shraddha is getting married
the day after.

1475
01:25:56,134 --> 01:25:57,943
And you haven't done squat for me
so far.

1476
01:25:58,034 --> 01:26:00,139
Either you go to the mosque or
you dress like a Christian priest.

1477
01:26:00,201 --> 01:26:01,908
I don't know what you're up to!

1478
01:26:01,967 --> 01:26:04,811
Vyas Uncle hounded Mr. Pandya and
now...

1479
01:26:04,901 --> 01:26:07,006
...he is getting Vivek married
to Shraddha.

1480
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:08,602
And I couldn't do a thing
about it.

1481
01:26:09,034 --> 01:26:10,707
You promised me!

1482
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:14,013
I will never marry and I will never
forgive you for this.

1483
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:17,013
Hey! What are you blabbering
about?

1484
01:26:17,367 --> 01:26:20,177
Listen, you are going to marry
Shraddha, okay?

1485
01:26:20,234 --> 01:26:21,713
No one can stop you.

1486
01:26:21,767 --> 01:26:23,405
Don't cry. I'll talk to Pandya.
Come on.

1487
01:26:23,467 --> 01:26:25,413
Come on.

1488
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:28,379
Dad, this is the last chance
to impress Neeleshwarji.

1489
01:26:28,434 --> 01:26:31,074
Some Muslims beat up his disciples
in Hyderabad.

1490
01:26:31,134 --> 01:26:33,740
A lot of people will be leading
a protest march from here.

1491
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:36,474
Hail Swami Neelanand.
- Hail!

1492
01:26:36,567 --> 01:26:38,774
Hail Swami Neelanand.
- Hail!

1493
01:26:38,867 --> 01:26:40,505
This won't be tolerated.

1494
01:26:40,567 --> 01:26:42,069
Tyranny won't be tolerated.

1495
01:26:42,134 --> 01:26:43,807
We will respond...
- In kind!

1496
01:26:43,901 --> 01:26:45,972
We will respond...
- In kind!

1497
01:26:46,067 --> 01:26:48,069
Hail Swami Neelanand.
- Hail!

1498
01:26:48,134 --> 01:26:50,705
Hail Swami Neelanand.
- Hail!

1499
01:26:50,767 --> 01:26:52,542
This won't be tolerated.
- Where is Mr. Pandya?

1500
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,944
There he is. He is called
Neeleshwar, here.

1501
01:26:55,034 --> 01:26:56,877
He's Neelanand Swami's
right hand man.

1502
01:26:57,234 --> 01:26:58,838
It is good,
he's the right hand man.

1503
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:00,937
I wonder what he would have to
do as the left hand man?

1504
01:27:01,001 --> 01:27:03,481
Come on.
- Tyranny won't be tolerated.

1505
01:27:03,534 --> 01:27:05,036
This won't be tolerated.

1506
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:06,704
Tyranny won't be tolerated.

1507
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,302
This won't be tolerated.

1508
01:27:08,401 --> 01:27:09,937
Tyranny won't be tolerated.

1509
01:27:10,034 --> 01:27:14,039
The world says, blue
is the greatest color of all.

1510
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:17,274
Hail the protector of religion
Neelanand Maharaj! - Hail!

1511
01:27:17,334 --> 01:27:19,644
Hail the protector of religion
Neelanand Maharaj! - Hail!

1512
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:22,271
Hail the protector of religion
Neelanand Maharaj! - Hail!

1513
01:27:22,334 --> 01:27:25,213
Hail the protector of religion
Neelanand Maharaj! - Hail!

1514
01:27:25,267 --> 01:27:29,272
The world says, blue
is the greatest color of all.

1515
01:27:29,334 --> 01:27:30,540
The world says...

1516
01:27:37,934 --> 01:27:39,004
Dad!

1517
01:27:39,067 --> 01:27:40,478
Is he Muslim?

1518
01:27:49,201 --> 01:27:50,839
I hide this.

1519
01:27:52,134 --> 01:27:54,011
To burn it in public!

1520
01:27:54,067 --> 01:27:55,637
Got a match?
Give it to me.

1521
01:27:56,201 --> 01:27:58,613
I don't smoke.
- Get me what you have.

1522
01:28:12,901 --> 01:28:15,643
Hail Swami Neelanand.
- Hail!

1523
01:28:15,734 --> 01:28:18,044
Hail Swami Neelanand.
- Hail!

1524
01:28:18,134 --> 01:28:20,944
Hail Swami Neelanand.
- Hail!

1525
01:28:21,567 --> 01:28:23,410
Hail Dharampal!
- Hail!

1526
01:28:23,467 --> 01:28:26,038
Hail Dharampal!
- Hail!

1527
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,441
Hail Dharampal!
- Hail!

1528
01:28:29,534 --> 01:28:31,377
Hail Dharampal!
- Hail!

1529
01:28:31,434 --> 01:28:33,880
Hail Dharampal!
- Hail!

1530
01:28:48,301 --> 01:28:50,872
Didn't things get out of
hand, yesterday?

1531
01:28:53,267 --> 01:28:54,439
What could I do?

1532
01:28:55,567 --> 01:28:57,376
What do you mean by that?

1533
01:28:57,967 --> 01:28:59,913
I don't understand...

1534
01:28:59,967 --> 01:29:01,469
...why did you burn the cap?

1535
01:29:01,534 --> 01:29:04,071
I don't like burning caps!

1536
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:09,736
Tell me something.

1537
01:29:10,267 --> 01:29:12,713
Why did you have it
in the first place?

1538
01:29:14,467 --> 01:29:15,741
The same old thing.

1539
01:29:18,167 --> 01:29:20,545
Listen, let me tell you something
clearly.

1540
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,773
<i>Amifl. Amara.</i>

1541
01:29:25,367 --> 01:29:28,405
I have to tell you this, clearly.
Okay?

1542
01:29:28,734 --> 01:29:31,772
Listen, the fact is that...

1543
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:33,740
Mom, I'll get it.

1544
01:29:37,734 --> 01:29:39,714
Bless you.

1545
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:41,771
Babaji!

1546
01:29:42,634 --> 01:29:43,977
Bless you.

1547
01:29:44,067 --> 01:29:45,307
"Neelanand Baba."

1548
01:29:45,367 --> 01:29:49,577
"Neelanand Baba."

1549
01:29:51,667 --> 01:29:54,079
Do you know why I am here?

1550
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:55,973
For tea and snacks?

1551
01:29:57,334 --> 01:30:01,146
Great!
Fantastic.

1552
01:30:02,967 --> 01:30:05,072
I am pleased with you.

1553
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:07,710
I am here to grant you a wish.

1554
01:30:07,767 --> 01:30:10,338
Dad, it's a good chance!
Ask for Shraddha to marry.

1555
01:30:10,801 --> 01:30:13,281
Why should I ask to marry her?

1556
01:30:14,067 --> 01:30:17,913
I look down on violence.

1557
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:24,307
But! The fire of anger within you...

1558
01:30:24,367 --> 01:30:26,745
...I empathize with it.

1559
01:30:26,801 --> 01:30:29,475
And influenced by that...

1560
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:32,340
...I am here to appoint you as the
protector of the law.

1561
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:34,902
Dharam pal!

1562
01:30:36,201 --> 01:30:37,680
Dharam pal!

1563
01:30:37,734 --> 01:30:41,409
That is the one
who protects religion.

1564
01:30:43,367 --> 01:30:47,179
It is time to live up to
the true meaning of your name.

1565
01:30:49,967 --> 01:30:51,878
Maharaj, what's in a name?

1566
01:30:51,934 --> 01:30:53,345
I am a simple, ordinary Hindu.

1567
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:55,880
It's not my job
to protect religion.

1568
01:30:56,501 --> 01:31:00,108
A simple, ordinary Hindu?

1569
01:31:01,867 --> 01:31:05,110
That is what I want to tell
the entire world.

1570
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:09,214
That is why, even a simple and
ordinary Hindu like you...

1571
01:31:09,301 --> 01:31:12,942
...is also forced to be
a sacred warrior.

1572
01:31:13,667 --> 01:31:17,740
Be brave!
Be fearless.

1573
01:31:18,767 --> 01:31:23,011
What will happen to the religion
if every Hindu is scared?

1574
01:31:24,634 --> 01:31:27,114
That is why, I have come home
to talk to you.

1575
01:31:27,467 --> 01:31:30,346
Very few devotees are lucky enough
to get this chance. - Really?

1576
01:31:30,434 --> 01:31:33,643
It's time to ask for your wish.

1577
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:37,113
I know it all and I know what you
will ask for...

1578
01:31:37,267 --> 01:31:40,146
See? He knows it all! He knows
what you will ask for.

1579
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:42,302
That old know it all!

1580
01:31:42,401 --> 01:31:44,403
He must have seen your love
story on the CCTV monitors.

1581
01:31:44,467 --> 01:31:47,641
Amit. Come here.

1582
01:31:50,901 --> 01:31:53,438
You are a good boy.

1583
01:31:53,734 --> 01:31:56,476
You serve the ashram very well.

1584
01:31:57,867 --> 01:32:00,677
You serve the ashram well.

1585
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:06,206
You check the bulbs
on the dome constantly.

1586
01:32:06,867 --> 01:32:09,108
Then, you wash the stairs
of the temple.

1587
01:32:09,167 --> 01:32:11,670
What a good boy!

1588
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:17,138
Swamiji,
he just needs your blessings.

1589
01:32:18,134 --> 01:32:21,013
Of course.

1590
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:24,773
Undoubtedly.

1591
01:32:28,034 --> 01:32:29,877
Neeleshwarji.

1592
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:35,349
This boy is in love
with your daughter.

1593
01:32:35,834 --> 01:32:38,576
Prabhuji, I had no idea
about this.

1594
01:32:38,901 --> 01:32:40,881
You are great.

1595
01:32:41,201 --> 01:32:42,646
You know it all.

1596
01:32:42,701 --> 01:32:44,942
They will make a fine couple.

1597
01:32:46,234 --> 01:32:49,613
I bless this wedding.

1598
01:32:50,001 --> 01:32:53,642
Swamiji, since you have been
so kind accept another request.

1599
01:32:53,867 --> 01:32:57,076
Sing a devotional hymn and
bless them both.

1600
01:32:57,134 --> 01:32:59,341
And grace us with your
divine bliss.

1601
01:33:02,967 --> 01:33:09,213
"Praise Lord Shiva."

1602
01:33:10,367 --> 01:33:14,213
(Sanskrit verses)

1603
01:33:14,301 --> 01:33:17,976
(Sanskrit verses)

1604
01:33:18,067 --> 01:33:21,742
(Sanskrit verses)

1605
01:33:21,834 --> 01:33:28,479
(Sanskrit verses)

1606
01:33:29,634 --> 01:33:33,514
(Sanskrit verses)

1607
01:33:33,567 --> 01:33:37,310
(Sanskrit verses)

1608
01:33:37,367 --> 01:33:41,179
(Sanskrit verses)

1609
01:33:41,267 --> 01:33:47,218
(Sanskrit verses)

1610
01:34:01,467 --> 01:34:02,844
Hit them!

1611
01:34:03,134 --> 01:34:04,545
Don't move forward!

1612
01:34:04,634 --> 01:34:05,908
Get back!

1613
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,274
Get back!

1614
01:34:07,334 --> 01:34:09,280
Why are you inside like a coward?

1615
01:34:09,334 --> 01:34:10,904
Come out you coward!

1616
01:34:12,567 --> 01:34:14,740
You burnt the Muslim's cap.

1617
01:34:14,834 --> 01:34:17,838
You are charged with hurting
communal feelings.

1618
01:34:19,834 --> 01:34:22,280
Sir, this is unjust.

1619
01:34:22,601 --> 01:34:25,309
First those people hit my
disciples.

1620
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,846
He expressed his protest.

1621
01:34:27,901 --> 01:34:29,539
You can say that in court.

1622
01:34:29,634 --> 01:34:32,308
The clip on YouTube is evidence
enough, against him.

1623
01:34:33,667 --> 01:34:34,668
Listen!

1624
01:34:34,734 --> 01:34:36,475
<i>Dharampzfl haâ€œ. haâ€œ.!</i>

1625
01:34:36,534 --> 01:34:38,514
<i>Dharampzfl haâ€œ. haâ€œ.!</i>

1626
01:34:38,601 --> 01:34:40,512
Calm down. Calm down.

1627
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:41,635
Or else we will have to
resort to a lathi (baton) charge.

1628
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:43,611
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1629
01:34:44,867 --> 01:34:46,505
Be kind enough to listen to me.

1630
01:34:47,501 --> 01:34:49,879
I am really sorry...

1631
01:34:50,167 --> 01:34:52,078
...that I burned the cap.

1632
01:34:52,667 --> 01:34:54,806
I beg you to forgive me.

1633
01:34:54,867 --> 01:34:57,245
What are you saying sorry for?
First, you burnt the cap!

1634
01:34:57,334 --> 01:35:00,577
You insulted us! Now he has been
caught and he is saying sorry.

1635
01:35:01,034 --> 01:35:04,607
Believe me, I am a Muslim, too.

1636
01:35:07,367 --> 01:35:08,869
I am one of you.

1637
01:35:08,967 --> 01:35:11,777
I have kept the burnt cap.
Look at this.

1638
01:35:17,334 --> 01:35:19,678
If you wish, I could recite
the Kalma.

1639
01:35:19,767 --> 01:35:21,804
And I have an adoption
certificate...

1640
01:35:21,867 --> 01:35:25,178
...which says that Meer Shauqat Ali
was my dad.

1641
01:35:26,767 --> 01:35:28,940
Please, forgive me.

1642
01:35:33,067 --> 01:35:35,638
You can't marry Shraddha.

1643
01:35:36,367 --> 01:35:38,540
You are a Muslim's son.

1644
01:35:38,934 --> 01:35:40,470
Guruji! Swamiji!

1645
01:35:40,567 --> 01:35:42,410
An FIR has been filed against
this man.

1646
01:35:42,467 --> 01:35:44,003
Go home, all of you.

1647
01:35:44,067 --> 01:35:45,705
Let the police do their jobs.

1648
01:35:45,801 --> 01:35:48,543
Sir, arrest him
and don't spare him.

1649
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:50,102
Let him go!

1650
01:35:50,201 --> 01:35:52,340
He is one of us!
Come on.

1651
01:35:52,401 --> 01:35:54,005
Everyone, go home.

1652
01:35:54,067 --> 01:35:55,603
Let's go home.

1653
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:57,340
Let them do their work.

1654
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:58,538
Come on, get out of here.

1655
01:36:07,167 --> 01:36:08,544
My son.

1656
01:36:08,801 --> 01:36:10,974
Did you have to do this charade?
- It isn't a charade, son.

1657
01:36:11,034 --> 01:36:14,743
I wanted to meet my lost father
and so...

1658
01:36:14,801 --> 01:36:17,577
I lost my dad in the bargain.

1659
01:36:17,667 --> 01:36:20,580
But I am not lost!
lam here, in front of you.

1660
01:36:20,634 --> 01:36:23,979
I am leaving. Goodbye.
- You're leaving?

1661
01:36:24,634 --> 01:36:26,580
Why is he talking so strangely?

1662
01:36:26,667 --> 01:36:28,112
He is talking strangely alright.

1663
01:36:28,167 --> 01:36:29,305
At least, he's not lying.

1664
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:31,938
Dad! - Listen to me.
I was really going to tell you.

1665
01:36:32,034 --> 01:36:33,877
It just because you got caught.

1666
01:36:33,934 --> 01:36:35,709
You are such a liar!

1667
01:36:35,767 --> 01:36:37,474
I am leaving to go to my
brother's house.

1668
01:36:39,467 --> 01:36:40,775
Listen to me.

1669
01:37:05,801 --> 01:37:07,678
Dharam!
There is a problem.

1670
01:37:07,767 --> 01:37:10,304
What is it?
- Rawal canceled the order.

1671
01:37:10,534 --> 01:37:12,571
He did?
- And Mehta? Mr. Mehta?

1672
01:37:12,667 --> 01:37:14,112
What?
- He rejected it!

1673
01:37:18,334 --> 01:37:21,042
Everyone changed within a day!

1674
01:37:22,267 --> 01:37:24,804
What did they say? The event can't
be planned without our food.

1675
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:26,641
See?
- Just forget it.

1676
01:37:26,701 --> 01:37:29,272
Alright, distribute the
food amongst the poor. - Alright.

1677
01:37:29,467 --> 01:37:30,844
Dharam.
- Yes.

1678
01:37:32,901 --> 01:37:36,041
Listen,
brother, take some time off.

1679
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:38,612
No, I will handle this.

1680
01:37:38,667 --> 01:37:40,078
Don't worry at all.

1681
01:37:41,601 --> 01:37:42,875
Do you understand?

1682
01:37:42,934 --> 01:37:44,811
For the business, you know...
- Yes.

1683
01:37:45,334 --> 01:37:47,075
I will take time off.

1684
01:37:47,434 --> 01:37:49,846
But how can I escape from myself?

1685
01:38:15,467 --> 01:38:18,539
Under Section IPC 146, 296, 298...

1686
01:38:19,534 --> 01:38:21,309
Are you being charged with this, at
your age?

1687
01:38:21,967 --> 01:38:23,674
Do you have a defense lawyer?

1688
01:38:25,434 --> 01:38:26,640
Your Honor.

1689
01:38:27,867 --> 01:38:29,312
I am the defense lawyer.

1690
01:38:29,401 --> 01:38:30,812
Who is he?
- Oh?

1691
01:38:30,867 --> 01:38:33,871
Nawab Mehmood Nazeem
Ali Shah Khan Bahadur.

1692
01:38:34,101 --> 01:38:36,274
So, how many lawyers does he have?

1693
01:38:36,534 --> 01:38:37,911
Where are the others?

1694
01:38:38,401 --> 01:38:41,007
No, Your Honor, itsjust me.

1695
01:38:41,467 --> 01:38:43,037
That is my name.

1696
01:38:43,467 --> 01:38:44,946
It may be a long name.

1697
01:38:45,034 --> 01:38:47,640
You need a couple of hearings
just to say my name.

1698
01:38:48,567 --> 01:38:49,841
Silence.

1699
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:51,908
Please, proceed.

1700
01:38:51,967 --> 01:38:53,344
Thank you very much, Sir.

1701
01:39:23,434 --> 01:39:24,674
Sir.

1702
01:39:27,034 --> 01:39:28,342
Sir.

1703
01:39:28,667 --> 01:39:30,544
This man used to pretend
to pray...

1704
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:32,637
...and try to trespass.

1705
01:39:33,434 --> 01:39:35,505
This infidel's
intentions are suspect.

1706
01:39:35,601 --> 01:39:39,344
I object to this baseless
accusation against my client.

1707
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:42,840
Sir, how can you accuse him?

1708
01:39:43,267 --> 01:39:47,443
Sir, by burning the cap,
he has proved...

1709
01:39:47,501 --> 01:39:51,039
...that he just wanted
to spread terror.

1710
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:54,946
And you intended to
convert him, that is all.

1711
01:39:55,567 --> 01:39:58,878
Oh, God! May Lord have mercy!
What are you saying?

1712
01:39:58,967 --> 01:40:00,776
Sir...
- Why would I do that?

1713
01:40:00,834 --> 01:40:03,474
Sir, the event you are
referring to...

1714
01:40:03,567 --> 01:40:06,878
...was that the first
time you met my client?

1715
01:40:08,267 --> 01:40:09,575
No.

1716
01:40:09,634 --> 01:40:13,548
When Dharampal first came to meet
his father...

1717
01:40:13,601 --> 01:40:16,207
...then you stopped him.
Why?

1718
01:40:17,234 --> 01:40:19,407
No, I didn't stop him I just...

1719
01:40:19,467 --> 01:40:23,540
Because, you said, learn
the Muslim customs, right?

1720
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:27,309
Sir, that was because...

1721
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:28,879
Wait a moment.

1722
01:40:28,967 --> 01:40:31,470
We have your
receptionist's statement.

1723
01:40:31,568 --> 01:40:33,047
Don't lie to me.

1724
01:40:33,134 --> 01:40:34,738
No, I am sure you
have the statement.

1725
01:40:34,801 --> 01:40:37,077
But, I never lie.

1726
01:40:37,367 --> 01:40:38,641
Sir.

1727
01:40:38,734 --> 01:40:41,180
In the interests of
humanity I thought...

1728
01:40:41,234 --> 01:40:43,145
...that his father is not well.

1729
01:40:43,234 --> 01:40:45,771
I thought,
if his father finds out...

1730
01:40:45,834 --> 01:40:48,337
...that his son is not
a Muslim, then...

1731
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,573
Didn't his father know...

1732
01:40:50,634 --> 01:40:52,272
...that he was adopted?

1733
01:40:53,934 --> 01:40:55,208
Yes, he knew.

1734
01:40:55,701 --> 01:40:58,477
So his father would understand
that...

1735
01:40:58,567 --> 01:41:01,070
...an adoptive parent
may be a non Muslim, too.

1736
01:41:02,167 --> 01:41:03,475
Yes, of course.

1737
01:41:03,767 --> 01:41:06,407
You Honor, his father...

1738
01:41:06,501 --> 01:41:09,573
...didn't marry again due to his
sorrow over his son.

1739
01:41:11,067 --> 01:41:13,980
He would have been happy to meet
his son.

1740
01:41:15,533 --> 01:41:19,037
But, the clergyman
only wanted to...

1741
01:41:19,100 --> 01:41:21,410
mconven my client.

1742
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:23,810
No!
- Sir, because of you...

1743
01:41:23,867 --> 01:41:27,212
...my client has lost
his mental balance.

1744
01:41:27,434 --> 01:41:29,607
You played with his emotions.

1745
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:31,270
And for that, I...

1746
01:41:31,334 --> 01:41:35,840
...l, will file
a lawsuit against you!

1747
01:41:35,901 --> 01:41:39,041
Under section 339 and 340...
- But...

1748
01:41:39,134 --> 01:41:40,738
...what are you saying?

1749
01:41:41,067 --> 01:41:42,774
No, please think it over calmly.

1750
01:41:42,867 --> 01:41:45,177
You don't have to do this.
- Sir.

1751
01:41:45,701 --> 01:41:47,510
Is his dad in a place...

1752
01:41:47,801 --> 01:41:49,747
...where non-Muslims can't enter?

1753
01:41:50,401 --> 01:41:53,405
No, Sir. It is not like that.

1754
01:41:54,234 --> 01:41:55,736
I was just being human...

1755
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:58,739
God have mercy!
Sir...

1756
01:41:58,834 --> 01:42:00,939
Sir. - Yes.
- You may leave.

1757
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:03,074
Yes, Sir.

1758
01:42:05,067 --> 01:42:07,047
Your Honor, this is the truth.

1759
01:42:07,901 --> 01:42:12,748
My client was forced by
circumstances to burn that cap.

1760
01:42:13,401 --> 01:42:15,278
He has said sorry for that.

1761
01:42:16,067 --> 01:42:19,879
Actually, the clergyman
is responsible for this.

1762
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:24,515
If he had let a
son meet his father...

1763
01:42:24,734 --> 01:42:26,372
...this would never have
happened.

1764
01:42:26,434 --> 01:42:28,539
The cap would not be burnt.

1765
01:42:28,834 --> 01:42:31,246
I met Dharampal's dad yesterday.

1766
01:42:31,301 --> 01:42:33,406
He is very ill.

1767
01:42:33,934 --> 01:42:38,440
Your Honor, whatever your verdict
may be...

1768
01:42:39,234 --> 01:42:42,443
...but, there is a higher court
than this one.

1769
01:42:42,834 --> 01:42:44,404
God's court of justice.

1770
01:42:45,167 --> 01:42:48,478
And in that court, my client...

1771
01:42:48,934 --> 01:42:50,277
...is innocent.

1772
01:42:51,567 --> 01:42:52,807
That's all, Your Honor.

1773
01:43:03,667 --> 01:43:07,376
This court hereby finds Dharampal
Rammohan Trivedi...

1774
01:43:08,167 --> 01:43:09,737
...not innocent.

1775
01:43:10,667 --> 01:43:13,147
But, he is not as great a
criminal as he is being shown as.

1776
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:16,246
He made a mistake given
the circumstances.

1777
01:43:16,734 --> 01:43:18,372
That is why, this court...

1778
01:43:18,767 --> 01:43:21,179
...orders him to offer
a hundred of these caps...

1779
01:43:21,234 --> 01:43:23,680
...to needy Muslims as a fine.

1780
01:43:25,334 --> 01:43:27,507
The clergyman is hereby ordered...

1781
01:43:27,567 --> 01:43:30,639
...to allow Dharampal to meet
his father at once.

1782
01:44:22,634 --> 01:44:26,104
He waited for his son,
till the end.

1783
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:28,871
Thank God the lawyer
gave his picture.

1784
01:44:29,834 --> 01:44:32,314
At least, he saw the face
of his son.

1785
01:44:34,768 --> 01:44:37,476
Lift up the chin.
Smile. Pleasant.

1786
01:45:18,267 --> 01:45:23,580
"Who created me?"

1787
01:45:26,534 --> 01:45:31,711
"My shadow questions me."

1788
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:40,111
"Caught in questions of
my own existence."

1789
01:45:40,334 --> 01:45:47,479
"My soul is in agony.
Let me see you."

1790
01:45:47,767 --> 01:45:54,207
"Heal my sorrow, oh Lord."

1791
01:45:54,767 --> 01:45:56,747
"Oh Lord."

1792
01:45:57,401 --> 01:46:04,615
"Oh Lord. Tell me, who I am."

1793
01:46:04,667 --> 01:46:11,414
"You are God and the
Almighty, oh Lord."

1794
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:34,207
"I am steeped in my sorrow."

1795
01:46:36,067 --> 01:46:42,143
"I don't lose, nor do I win."

1796
01:46:43,467 --> 01:46:49,042
"My feet walk on shards
of glass."

1797
01:46:50,834 --> 01:46:56,580
"The tears fall, as I laugh."

1798
01:46:57,667 --> 01:47:01,080
"This traveler is lost."

1799
01:47:01,334 --> 01:47:04,872
"He doesn't know
the way back home."

1800
01:47:05,067 --> 01:47:11,575
"My soul is in agony.
Let me see you."

1801
01:47:12,367 --> 01:47:19,342
"Heal my sorrow, oh Lord."

1802
01:47:19,401 --> 01:47:21,904
"Oh Lord."

1803
01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:25,707
"Oh Lord."

1804
01:47:25,767 --> 01:47:29,408
"Tell me, who I am."

1805
01:47:29,501 --> 01:47:37,352
"You are God and the
Almighty, oh Lord."

1806
01:47:42,967 --> 01:47:45,379
What did I gain by walking
on the path of religion?

1807
01:47:46,601 --> 01:47:48,877
My wife and kids went away.

1808
01:47:49,067 --> 01:47:50,808
My father went away, too.

1809
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:54,711
What did I gain?
Liquor?

1810
01:47:58,267 --> 01:48:01,510
I am going to destroy Neelanand.

1811
01:48:01,667 --> 01:48:05,012
Did you notice the emphasis
I put on the word, destroy?

1812
01:48:05,334 --> 01:48:07,905
I will destroy him with emphasis.

1813
01:48:09,134 --> 01:48:10,408
Destroy!

1814
01:48:11,801 --> 01:48:14,008
Stop the car to one side.

1815
01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:36,473
Amazing! He's winking here, too!
Rascal!

1816

1817
01:48:57,834 --> 01:49:01,611

(Sanskrit verses)

1820
01:49:09,267 --> 01:49:14,410
(Sanskrit verses)

1821
01:49:36,334 --> 01:49:37,677
Hello?

1822
01:49:39,034 --> 01:49:40,342
Yes?

1823
01:49:41,467 --> 01:49:43,071
Mom, it's dad, again.

1824
01:49:44,134 --> 01:49:45,442
Hello?

1825
01:49:50,267 --> 01:49:51,507
What is it, now?

1826
01:49:51,601 --> 01:49:52,739
He said, he is going
to the ashram.

1827
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,404
He will talk to Swamiji face
to face.

1828
01:49:54,500 --> 01:49:56,446
The day of appearance is a huge
celebration.

1829
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:58,810
We have to stop him!
This man is crazy.

1830
01:50:03,701 --> 01:50:08,013
Neelanand Baba.

1831
01:50:10,167 --> 01:50:14,513
Neelanand Baba.

1832
01:50:16,434 --> 01:50:20,405
Neelanand Baba.

1833
01:50:24,267 --> 01:50:26,372
Eternal joy!

1834
01:50:28,067 --> 01:50:30,104
The joy of yoga!

1835
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:33,607
The bliss of the honest soul!

1836
01:50:33,667 --> 01:50:37,774
"Neelanand Baba."

1837
01:50:37,834 --> 01:50:41,748
"Neelanand Baba."

1838
01:50:41,834 --> 01:50:46,783
"Those who come to you..."

1839
01:50:50,134 --> 01:50:54,173
"Those who come to you...

1840
01:50:54,267 --> 01:50:58,579
...you shower him with happiness."

1841
01:50:58,634 --> 01:51:00,545
Watch slime bloom in the lotus!

1842
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:02,546
"Those who come to you...

1843
01:51:02,634 --> 01:51:07,083
...you shower him with happiness."

1844
01:51:07,134 --> 01:51:10,843
"Neelanand Baba."

1845
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:15,280
This is a rare
honor for all of you.

1846
01:51:15,334 --> 01:51:18,872
As always, even this year...

1847
01:51:19,167 --> 01:51:22,307
...Swamiji will greet
his news devotees.

1848
01:51:25,467 --> 01:51:26,912
Greetings, Maharaj.

1849
01:51:27,201 --> 01:51:30,944
Welcome to our family.

1850
01:51:33,834 --> 01:51:36,508
Hello, check.
One, two, three.

1851
01:51:36,601 --> 01:51:38,342
We would like to know...

1852
01:51:38,534 --> 01:51:43,847
...do you have a trial membership
package at the ashram?

1853
01:51:44,934 --> 01:51:48,279
After that we will
consider joining.

1854
01:51:48,334 --> 01:51:49,813
Do you get my drift?

1855
01:51:49,867 --> 01:51:51,938
Hello, can you hear me?

1856
01:51:52,034 --> 01:51:55,277
This is a religious family.
We don't do all that.

1857
01:51:58,100 --> 01:51:59,408
Swamiji.
- Yes.

1858
01:51:59,667 --> 01:52:01,544
My friend is a Hindu.

1859
01:52:01,634 --> 01:52:05,138
His daughter is in love
with a Muslim boy.

1860
01:52:05,234 --> 01:52:08,010
Is that allowed by your
religion?

1861
01:52:08,934 --> 01:52:11,414
If the boy is willing to
give up his religion...

1862
01:52:11,467 --> 01:52:13,140
...and accept Swamiji's
allegiance...

1863
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:16,010
...then, Swamiji will be pleased
to bless him.

1864
01:52:16,367 --> 01:52:20,611
But, what is the issue if the boy
and girl don't convert?

1865
01:52:23,167 --> 01:52:26,046
We can never accept
such a marriage.

1866
01:52:26,300 --> 01:52:29,679
But, why?
- I will answer that.

1867
01:52:31,301 --> 01:52:35,613
Lord Krishna has
said in the Gita...

1868
01:52:36,267 --> 01:52:38,611
...in paragraph seven, verse 15.

1869
01:52:39,134 --> 01:52:44,174
(Sanskrit verses)

1870
01:52:44,234 --> 01:52:49,206
(Sanskrit verses)

1871
01:52:49,268 --> 01:52:53,580
That means, the man who
is a non believer...

1872
01:52:54,067 --> 01:52:58,447
...who believes in any power
other than God...

1873
01:52:58,501 --> 01:53:01,846
...he can't come back to God.

1874
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:05,274
Maharaj, it can also mean that...

1875
01:53:05,334 --> 01:53:08,508
...those who are trapped by
the illusory web of creation...

1876
01:53:08,567 --> 01:53:10,547
...those who are influenced by
material happiness...

1877
01:53:10,601 --> 01:53:13,013
...can't come to me for succor.
However...

1878
01:53:13,067 --> 01:53:16,276
...God has also provided another
path for their redemption.

1879
01:53:16,734 --> 01:53:18,907
He provides a service
entrance for them.

1880
01:53:18,967 --> 01:53:23,006
He mentions in 18th
para of the Gita verse 66...

1881
01:53:23,367 --> 01:53:27,110
(Sanskrit verses)

1882
01:53:27,668 --> 01:53:31,548
(Sanskrit verses)

1883
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:35,309
That means, forget every1hing
and turn to me.

1884
01:53:35,367 --> 01:53:38,211
I will absolve you of your sins
and accept you.

1885
01:53:39,167 --> 01:53:41,545
The same goes for
the holy Quran, too.

1886
01:53:41,967 --> 01:53:43,537
It is mentioned
in the Sura-e-Yunus.

1887
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:45,204
All of them mention it.

1888
01:53:45,300 --> 01:53:47,906
Anyone can accept Islam.

1889
01:53:58,867 --> 01:54:00,744
Who is this imposter?
- Who is he?

1890
01:54:02,367 --> 01:54:05,644
The same guy who burnt the cap.
That youtube guy.

1891
01:54:05,700 --> 01:54:07,771
Whether you pray,
perform a veneration...

1892
01:54:07,867 --> 01:54:10,677
...light candles, incense, or lamps.
- What is he saying?

1893
01:54:10,734 --> 01:54:12,475
Chant the beads
or the Tibetan wheel.

1894
01:54:12,534 --> 01:54:14,241
It all goes to
the same holy spirit.

1895
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:16,780
Then, why does someone who
prays differently...

1896
01:54:16,867 --> 01:54:19,279
...get called infidiel?
Answer me.

1897
01:54:20,267 --> 01:54:22,975
This man is a liar.

1898
01:54:23,467 --> 01:54:24,912
Did you see that?

1899
01:54:25,534 --> 01:54:27,946
He is dressed as an ascetic.

1900
01:54:28,700 --> 01:54:32,170
Now, he is talking nonsense
and mocking us.

1901
01:54:33,167 --> 01:54:37,877
The truth is he was born in a
Muslim family.

1902
01:54:38,267 --> 01:54:41,510
A Muslim!
- Security! Throw him out.

1903
01:54:41,567 --> 01:54:44,707
Speak up, Dharampal,
is that a lie?

1904
01:54:44,767 --> 01:54:48,180
I admit, I was born
to a Muslim mother.

1905
01:54:48,267 --> 01:54:50,907
But a Hindu mom raised me.

1906
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,708
How will you decide which
religion I belong to?

1907
01:54:53,767 --> 01:54:55,974
He seems drunk, who is he?

1908
01:54:56,034 --> 01:54:57,377
How dare he come here?

1909
01:54:57,434 --> 01:55:00,244
What do you wish to say?
Tell me, Dharampal!

1910
01:55:01,434 --> 01:55:03,914
Why didn't you let my
son get married?

1911
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:06,009
Because, my parents are Muslim.

1912
01:55:06,067 --> 01:55:09,207
Since that is the case,
do I lose all sense of myself?

1913
01:55:09,434 --> 01:55:12,278
I am someone's dad, a son,
a husband.

1914
01:55:12,367 --> 01:55:14,244
Does none of it matter?

1915
01:55:14,301 --> 01:55:16,178
Does only my religion matter?

1916
01:55:16,867 --> 01:55:19,575
Religion is meant to unite
and divide, not estrange.

1917
01:55:19,834 --> 01:55:21,905
But Priests of all religions
do that.

1918
01:55:22,001 --> 01:55:23,207
Listen, you rogue!

1919
01:55:23,301 --> 01:55:25,872
Don't say another word.
- What is he saying?

1920
01:55:25,967 --> 01:55:29,005
I am not here to create a scene.

1921
01:55:29,534 --> 01:55:31,912
I am here for my son.

1922
01:55:32,668 --> 01:55:35,842
But, I don't care who you pray to.

1923
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:38,873
Just answer one question.

1924
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:44,240
If the Neel Parivar doesn't accept
someone born out of its religion...

1925
01:55:44,467 --> 01:55:46,174
...then, your Swamiji...

1926
01:55:46,234 --> 01:55:49,238
...who is born into a Sikh family...

1927
01:55:49,301 --> 01:55:51,440
...how can he lead your family?

1928
01:55:51,701 --> 01:55:53,146
He is calling Swamiji a Sikh!

1929
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:55,976
Call for security
or we will kill him.

1930
01:55:56,034 --> 01:55:59,106
Yes, Neelanand Swami...

1931
01:55:59,167 --> 01:56:03,616
...is the former Bhangra pop
singer Manjeet Manchala.

1932
01:56:03,900 --> 01:56:06,278
How can this performer
be your leader?

1933
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:07,174
What?

1934
01:56:07,267 --> 01:56:10,146
"Wear a fancy turban."

1935
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:12,905
"Dance to the beat of the drum."

1936
01:56:12,967 --> 01:56:16,608
(Sanskrit verses)

1937
01:56:16,700 --> 01:56:19,544
(Sanskrit verses)

1938
01:56:19,601 --> 01:56:22,980
Manjeet Manchala and Swamiji
are the same man.

1939
01:56:23,034 --> 01:56:24,377
Their voices are the same.

1940
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:26,643
Test this, and you
will know the truth.

1941
01:56:26,734 --> 01:56:28,907
"Why do you stare at me
when you dance?"

1942
01:56:28,967 --> 01:56:30,708
(Sanskrit verses)

1943
01:56:30,767 --> 01:56:33,611
(Sanskrit verses)

1944
01:56:33,667 --> 01:56:36,147
And another thing, the eyes.

1945
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:39,870
Manchala and Neelanand have
the same eyes.

1946
01:56:40,367 --> 01:56:43,974
Their eyes twitch
when they are nervous. Watch this.

1947
01:56:44,167 --> 01:56:46,511
Look at Manchala's nervous twitch.

1948
01:56:46,567 --> 01:56:49,810
This is called blapharospasm.

1949
01:56:49,901 --> 01:56:51,847
It is a very rare disease.

1950
01:56:53,701 --> 01:56:55,942
He cut his hair and shaved
his beard off.

1951
01:56:56,034 --> 01:56:58,844
He could fool all of you.

1952
01:56:58,900 --> 01:57:01,141
But, what can he do about his voice?
- What is this?

1953
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:03,077
He's a fake?
- What will you do about the eye?

1954
01:57:03,134 --> 01:57:05,876
This is impossible,
he can't do this.

1955
01:57:05,934 --> 01:57:09,746
His list of exploits
is really long.

1956
01:57:09,901 --> 01:57:12,347
The Havala scam, trafficking.

1957
01:57:13,067 --> 01:57:14,978
Abusing innocent girls.

1958
01:57:15,068 --> 01:57:17,048
He has done it all.

1959
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:20,046
He pulled off a black money scam?

1960
01:57:20,101 --> 01:57:21,671
It is true.

1961
01:57:22,434 --> 01:57:24,539
He has made so many girls
fall pregnant!

1962
01:57:24,634 --> 01:57:26,580
That is a lot of evidence.

1963
01:57:31,167 --> 01:57:32,942
This is Manjeet Manchala.

1964
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:38,946
Ever since he was set free
on bail he has been missing.

1965
01:57:39,034 --> 01:57:42,243
Suddenly, he emerged a
few years ago from Ahmedabad.

1966
01:57:42,301 --> 01:57:43,905
As Swami Neelanand.

1967
01:57:43,967 --> 01:57:45,378
Is this a lie?

1968
01:58:00,167 --> 01:58:02,044
Swamiji, come on, hurry.
- Come fast.

1969
01:58:02,134 --> 01:58:03,841
He has run away!

1970
01:58:05,034 --> 01:58:06,570
He has fooled us!

1971
01:58:14,134 --> 01:58:16,444
Neeleshwar?
- It's not Neeleshwar.

1972
01:58:16,901 --> 01:58:18,812
<i>Badrinath Pandya.</i>

1973
01:58:21,834 --> 01:58:23,074
Listen.

1974
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:26,381
Listen to me. I am not here
to provoke anyone.

1975
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:28,711
I won't prove that...

1976
01:58:28,801 --> 01:58:31,645
...he is not Hindu and I am
not a Muslim.

1977
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:37,008
I am here, to take my family home.

1978
01:58:37,667 --> 01:58:38,975
That is it.

1979
01:58:41,634 --> 01:58:44,638
My family's peace is my religion.

1980
01:58:45,334 --> 01:58:48,372
I don't care about
the Hindu Muslim labels.

1981
01:58:50,567 --> 01:58:52,877
I read the Quran for my dad.

1982
01:58:53,467 --> 01:58:55,208
He left the world.

1983
01:58:55,534 --> 01:58:57,445
I took up the Gita for my son.

1984
01:58:58,034 --> 01:58:59,707
He left the house.

1985
01:59:03,001 --> 01:59:05,811
I was left alone
with only books in my hands.

1986
01:59:08,867 --> 01:59:11,575
Why are we fighting over labels
about religion?

1987
01:59:11,934 --> 01:59:14,005
This poison is within our DNA.

1988
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:18,707
When I read the Gita
and the Quran a bit, I realized...

1989
01:59:18,767 --> 01:59:23,307
...that, Ram and Rahim, Mohammad
and Mahadev are one.

1990
01:59:23,467 --> 01:59:25,538
They say the same things.

1991
01:59:25,601 --> 01:59:27,239
Do good, be good.

1992
01:59:27,334 --> 01:59:29,007
Wear a cap or apply the tilak.

1993
01:59:29,468 --> 01:59:30,606
Do good.

1994
01:59:30,667 --> 01:59:32,943
There is only one true religion.

1995
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,308
Humanity.

1996
01:59:34,934 --> 01:59:36,072
Humanity.

1997
01:59:43,334 --> 01:59:44,779
Missed you Dad.

1998
01:59:45,268 --> 01:59:46,576
Dharam.

1999
01:59:50,734 --> 01:59:52,145
Dad!

2000
02:00:11,534 --> 02:00:14,242
Abdul, make sure it is tasty.

2001
02:00:14,334 --> 02:00:15,642
We have very important guests.

2002
02:00:15,734 --> 02:00:17,179
Our image is at stake.

2003
02:00:17,234 --> 02:00:18,304
One moment.

2004
02:00:18,367 --> 02:00:19,846
Tell me.
I will be back.

2005
02:00:19,934 --> 02:00:21,242
Don't worry.
I am here.

2006
02:00:21,334 --> 02:00:23,507
It is going to be fun!
Don't worry.

2007
02:00:23,567 --> 02:00:24,705
It will be done.

2008
02:00:26,300 --> 02:00:30,510
"Carefree and willful."

2009
02:00:30,567 --> 02:00:32,945
Come in.
- Sir.

2010
02:00:33,734 --> 02:00:36,237
Very nice.
Be happy, be successful.

2011
02:00:36,334 --> 02:00:38,143
No matter where you may live.

2012
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:40,407
What is this?

2013
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:43,913
Come here, a picture.
- Of course.

2014
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:46,009
Yes. Go for it.

2015
02:00:47,767 --> 02:00:50,907
"Wear a fancy turban.."

2016
02:00:51,301 --> 02:00:52,541
"With the drum beat playing."

2017
02:00:52,601 --> 02:00:54,137
What is wrong with you?

2018
02:00:54,234 --> 02:00:55,577
Dad?
- Yes.

2019
02:00:55,668 --> 02:00:57,477
Dad, this is my friend Peter.

2020
02:00:57,801 --> 02:00:59,644
Hello!
- Peter?

2021
02:00:59,767 --> 02:01:04,978
Don't ask me to read the
Bible or light candles.

2022
02:01:05,067 --> 02:01:06,171
No.

2023
02:01:06,834 --> 02:01:08,108
Wonderful!

2024
02:01:08,167 --> 02:01:11,705
"Why do you stare
when I dance?"

2025
02:01:25,501 --> 02:01:27,708
"We are unique."

2026
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:32,374
"With one look
everyone is floored."

2027
02:01:32,434 --> 02:01:34,675
"We are unique."

2028
02:01:34,701 --> 02:01:36,977
"With one look
everyone is floored."

2029
02:01:37,034 --> 02:01:41,540
"When I move to the beat,
I rule the crowd."

2030
02:01:41,601 --> 02:01:46,209
"I'm the Sardar (leader) of
Bhangra, do you know, baby?"

2031
02:01:46,301 --> 02:01:50,716
"It's unending, do you know, baby?"

2032
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:55,271
"I'm the Sardar (leader) of
Bhangra, do you know, baby?"

2033
02:01:55,334 --> 02:02:00,249
"It's unending, do you know, baby?"

2034
02:02:09,234 --> 02:02:13,740
"At the club, every day,
the girls call to me."

2035
02:02:13,834 --> 02:02:18,442
"At the club, every day,
the girls call to me."

2036
02:02:18,500 --> 02:02:22,971
"lam not stingy,
I splash the cash around."

2037
02:02:23,034 --> 02:02:27,574
"I'm a lover and the man,
and when you're in my sights..."

2038
02:02:27,634 --> 02:02:32,208
"I'm the Sardar (leader) of
Bhangra, do you know, baby?"

2039
02:02:32,267 --> 02:02:36,807
"It's unending, do you know, baby?"

2040
02:02:36,867 --> 02:02:41,475
"I'm the Sardar (leader) of
Bhangra, do you know, baby?"

2041
02:02:41,534 --> 02:02:45,539
"It's unending, do you know, baby?"

2042
02:02:46,101 --> 02:02:50,641
"Let's groove and move."

2043
02:02:50,701 --> 02:02:55,172
"Let just rock it and move
to the beat."

2044
02:02:55,234 --> 02:02:59,808
"My beat rocks the joint.
It can fit every mood."

2045
02:02:59,900 --> 02:03:04,349
"My beat rocks the joint.
It can fit every mood."

2046
02:03:04,434 --> 02:03:09,042
"Shoulders dipping at
every beat, that is my habit."

2047
02:03:09,101 --> 02:03:13,516
"The world fears my power."

2048
02:03:13,567 --> 02:03:18,209
"I'm the Sardar (leader) of
Bhangra, do you know, baby?"

2049
02:03:18,267 --> 02:03:22,841
"It's unending, do you know, baby?"

2050
02:03:22,900 --> 02:03:27,440
"I'm the Sardar (leader) of
Bhangra, do you know, baby?"

2051
02:03:27,501 --> 02:03:31,506
"It's unending, do you know, baby?"
