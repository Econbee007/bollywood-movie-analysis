00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:31,374
A temple whose study is more than
other schools

2
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:37,915
it dont only make promises.
It also fulfils them

3
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:43,123
no matter its building is old
than other schools

4
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:49,597
but its study is much better than
other schools

5
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:58,507
and the whole credit goes to its
principal

6
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,856

7
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,469

15
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,116
Last time when you took my fine,
you did not return it

16
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,907

17
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:29,754

26
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,138
You will take time to understand me

27
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,215

28
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,463
All have doubt

29
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:00,304

36
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,004
who is pushing management?

37
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,038
Its too late

38
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,016

39
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,739

42
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:35,661

44

45
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:04,590
change your hobby into profession.
School also needs a music teacher

46
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,468

then i dont do it

47
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,920

and its become life style for me now

51
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,340
you are right

52
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,245
principal still not come

53
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,882
check my heartbeat

54
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,820
principal is coming

55
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,042
he is a new teacher

56
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:46,286
i joined this school 32 years ago

57
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:52,862
on that time there were about
30 to 35 schools

58
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,299
and we were on top

59
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,370
now there are 350 to 400 schools

60
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,709
still our school name is in history

61
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,082
i dont like people talking about past

62
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:31,293
as a sports teacher, the management give you
facilities... are you happy with them?

63
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:41,277
It needs some make over

64
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,994
its just a dream

65
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:13,040
when you joined this school?
What did you want?

66
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,361
I can do anything for students

67
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,968
if i send you foreign for studies then
you would do more better

68
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,669
you think this for me...
thats enough for me

69
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:47,078
i think this for me but this thinking
is a question for me

70
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,866
it was taking three times more fees
on that time

71
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,136
and i think its taking 10 times
more than us

72
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,834
its a very small school than ours

73
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:22,773
still all parents are willing to
get admission in that school

74
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:27,508
people are ready to give any amount
as a donation

75
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,854
i have heard they use digital black board

76
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:38,260
they use many high tech facilities that
we cant compete

77
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:47,497
we are still behind than many schools

78
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,111
management is making a plan

79
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:02,246
i will inform you through email

80
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,874

81
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,780
Its not like that

82
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,672
if you scare than tell me

83
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,415

84
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,288

86
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:03,342

I think i have to work hard

90
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,497
i think school needs funds

91
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:35,043
will i get the salary?

92
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,517
Our principal thinks about school alot

93
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,748
thats why he is very stressed

94
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,124
he is also going to USA

95
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,034

96
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:14,217
we all thought...
i must be a very old age person

97
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:28,533
principal talked to you about music

98
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:33,332
yes he was saying...

99
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,986

101
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:17,646
without asking you i promised
students that tomorrow there will be a music class

102
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,477

I will tell them

103
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:55,244

00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,232

113
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,888

114
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,168

in our school there are 40
students in one class

146
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,987
which is better than other schools

147

157
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,107

158
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,676
now what will we do?

159
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,178
Your teachers are also not with you

160
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,850

161
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,118

166
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:48,567

167
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,414

00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:50,194

187
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:57,739
you deny this?

188
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,969
Whom you ask this?

189
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:04,246
What is the thing to ask in it?

190
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:11,445
You care about students health but
you dont care about school health

191
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,822
what is loss in it?

192
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:18,227
I tell you the logic

193
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,799
school can save Rs 6 per bottle

194
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,369
you can sell all 4 in market

195
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:39,082
we have to use atleast one container

196
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,981
its a legal matter. Dont involve in this.
Read this

197
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,591
i'm tired.
Dont ask me

198
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,231
tomorrow i want all the papers

199
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:24,217
play as loud as you can

200
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:28,194
play it

201
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,966
play it loud

202
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:41,545
what is going on here?

203
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,278
They are playing

204
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,091
who give them guitars?

205
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:00,527
Your all questions answer are in it

206
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,370
you dont like childrens?

207
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:22,317
I like them but you can only
see these childrens

208
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:26,089
but i can see those students too

209
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,250
can you see those students happy?

210
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:44,706
Have you ever played guitar?

211
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:53,742
You have to learn it.
These childrens cant hold guitar even

212
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:28,013
how can we calm down?

213
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,157
Its a management decision

214
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:47,637
you put this on each other

215
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:54,106
we dont know whether they are
running school or shop?

216
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:59,379
Principal is coming tomorrow.
We will talk to him

217
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,138
what are you doing?

218
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:06,740
Now you started thinking?

219
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:10,715
I told him to stand here

220
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,553
whats in your hand?

221
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:20,993
Water? If you give him water than
i wont give you water

222
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:51,889

223
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:55,295
you are not going good

224
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:00,862
i dont care where you will bring us

225
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:04,698
but before going anywhere have
a look at this

226
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:13,441
its a supreme court order that any
private school can increase its fees

227
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,749
your son forgets everything.
He did not bring the fees

228
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:54,380
he was not ignoring

229
00:44:55,025 --> 00:45:00,156
he knows i dont have money thats
why he did not tell me

230
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:14,540
i just give him some punishment and
you come here

231
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:20,776
i have manage to arrange his school fees

232
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:29,858
we are asking just more

233
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:41,796
you need time?
You will get time

234
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:49,611

235
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:11,429

236
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:18,538

238
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:56,210
I'm doing my work

239
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:59,313
your religion tells you this?

240
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,017
You understand one thing

241
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:16,197

242
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,538

00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,572
i dont understand this

244
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:31,344
you cant understand this

245
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:38,178
cut his fees from my salary

246
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,195
we wanna talk to you alone

247
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:34,602
sharma go outside

248
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:39,810
thank god you have come back

249
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:42,683
or sharma was about to sell school

250
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:51,450
he is right.
He misbehave with everyone

251
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,126
please stop sharma

252
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:10,544
do think sharma has that power and mind
that he can do this?

253
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:13,882
He is doing on my instructions

254
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:31,398
i also want co-operation from you

255
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:49,351
i cant see this

256
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,789
he is right

257
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:04,795
he is the most senior here.
I will also do the same

258
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,546
why you call all of us here?

259
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:02,123
I know what happened between you
and principal

260
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:08,797
but one thing is clear.
You cant understand one thing

261
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:19,304
you saw whatever happened there

262
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:29,710
thats why we have to do this

263
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,947
resignation is not the solution of problem

264
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:39,394
if principal will take action against
us then?

265
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:50,330
Atleast talk positive

266
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:54,570
if they take resignation then?
It wont happen

267
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:58,503
if all teachers resign together than
how a school will run?

268
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:31,012
Principal and management this
more far than you

269
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:40,411
new teacher willl come in place of you

270
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,517
they will do as management will say

271
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:51,592
i'm a poor guy.
Thats why i'm peon in school

272
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:56,570

You are well educated, you can think

276
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:51,453

reputation

278
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:32,618

Students will be tired

287
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:37,642
trust me students will enjoy

288
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:58,378

music

289
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:00,950

290
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:07,626

296
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:25,336
He dont know how to do
friendship

297
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,201
they only listen to heart

298
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:06,080
it means Parth heart is better than
all of us

299
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:39,310
will you be my friend?

300
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:01,460

310
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:37,746
students are not stars

311
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:40,221

376
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:02,008
is it necessary to say sponsors name?

377
01:22:54,736 --> 01:22:57,637

01:23:11,786 --> 01:23:14,653

What you did so that all students
go for strike?

381
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:02,233

382
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:09,836

388
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:01,493

i feel very good.
Nothing is better than this

403
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:31,066
i never think its a business.
Its always a profession for me

404
01:28:34,075 --> 01:28:36,566
now this profession has become
business

405
01:28:41,249 --> 01:28:48,246

thinking is updated or not.

406

accounts since last 4 years

408
01:29:58,126 --> 01:29:59,354

01:30:00,194 --> 01:30:01,957
competition is increased

410
01:30:03,164 --> 01:30:08,033
many schools has become business

411
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:17,669
our school's reputation is much better

412
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:57,442
if you dont give me much profit then
i will close down school

413
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:04,224

422
01:33:25,466 --> 01:33:29,402

423
01:33:30,705 --> 01:33:33,435

424
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:39,470

434
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:08,987
