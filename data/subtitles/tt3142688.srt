2
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,711
What is happen to this city?

3
00:00:15,967 --> 00:00:19,073
Ashes here, smoke there.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,004
Why are you so silent?

5
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:24,373
Why have smoke forced
down your throat?

6
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:26,078
Why tolerate?

7
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:27,441
Why banned?

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,610
Let's bring this
reckless act to an end.

9
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:33,436
Smoking is banned in
all public places.

10
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,274
And it is apply.

11
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,368
Don't smoke.

12
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:37,907
No let anyone do.

13
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:40,935
Smoking will cost you.

14
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:46,806
Your one seeks happiness.

15
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:51,706
But isn't has a very
high price to pay.

16
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:55,238
Smoking can cost
you your health.

17
00:00:56,833 --> 00:01:01,339
And can also seriously affect the
health and welfare of those who endure.

18
00:01:02,367 --> 00:01:06,406
Don't have them pay the
price for your smoking.

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,443
Smoking will cost you.

20
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,310
Ferdie has a candle
for every ailment.

21
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:01,646
He's the postmaster
of the village...

22
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:03,508
but no one here writes
or posts letters.

23
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:09,970
The man with the golden voice.

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,640
The only choir boy who refused
to stop singing in church...

25
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,577
even after he wasn't
a boy anymore.

26
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,542
Floating in a life inside his own
head, my best friend Ferdie...

27
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,835
who'll never have a
story to tell...

28
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,780
unless the story comes
looking for him

29
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:34,870
This is my home. This is
my village of Pocolim.

30
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:36,310
Hidden somewhere in Goa.

31
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:38,468
Don't try looking for it.

32
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:39,967
You won't find it.

33
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:45,943
Time passes in a
strange way here.

34
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,772
It stops when you stop...

35
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,403
and runs when you run.

36
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,210
Isn't that interesting?

37
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:59,345
I wonder what I wish
for everyday...

38
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:00,967
Maybe, wishing is a bad habit.

39
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:05,293
Like picking your nose and
wiping it under the table...

40
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:10,113
or eating too much spicy
Sorpotel in summer.

41
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:12,406
Yet, not a day passes
without a wish.

42
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:45,674
This is Rosalina,
my mother-in-law.

43
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:48,775
You know some peoples are just
want to take charge to everything.

44
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:52,742
Imagine a puppet-show,
as large as a village.

45
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,678
If Mai ever threw
away the strings...

46
00:06:57,233 --> 00:06:59,076
life in Pocoli would
just crumble to a halt.

47
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:06,971
Happy feast.

48
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,674
Call me Mrs. Eucharistica.

49
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:13,737
Mrs. Eucharis... - Forget it.

50
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:17,042
So you're Maria's...

51
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,313
The one Maria's
sis-in-law spoke about.

52
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:25,533
You call this a bio-data.

53
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:28,071
Why oh why?

54
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,676
Why means what, aunty. - What?

55
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:33,067
What?

56
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:34,810
You just said 'Why means what'.

57
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,437
No, I mean you said... I said...

58
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:39,053
That's the problem
with you youngsters.

59
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:40,803
You just can't speak properly.

60
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,411
How why means what?

61
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,100
Idiot. Come on.

62
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,974
Now say fast, what you want.

63
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,740
Aunty Maria said you'll fix
me up with a nice girl.

64
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:52,779
Fair complexion
and full of life.

65
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:02,337
Does your aunty think
I'm a magician?

66
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:05,769
I'll go to the gym.

67
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:09,439
So what are you waiting for?

68
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:11,241
Christmas?

69
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:14,076
Whether it's a leaf on a tree
or a dog on the street...

70
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:16,093
no one can move an inch,
without Mai's permission.

71
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,979
If you mess with Mai,
it's best to leave town.

72
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:28,578
Except, in Pocolim
nobody leaves.

73
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,938
Angie.

74
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:32,602
Yes, Mai.

75
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,071
Did Nereus drink
his milk properly?

76
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:44,478
Can't you land on your feet?

77
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:50,933
Mai.

78
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:53,407
Have you noticed Nereus
keeps falling asleep...

79
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:55,378
at the strangest of times?

80
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:58,312
What's so strange about it?

81
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,207
He sleeps when he feels sleepy.

82
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,374
You know it's called Narcolepsy.

83
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:04,467
Where you keep falling asleep.

84
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:06,735
You leave Nereus alone.

85
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:09,127
He knows better than you
how to behave like a cat.

86
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:11,604
Next you'll be telling me
how much I should sleep?

87
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:15,206
Rosie and I have just
one thing in common.

88
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:16,705
Loneliness.

89
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:20,009
I don't know when
Rosie's husband died.

90
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,807
She never speaks of it.
And I never ask.

91
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,738
As for me, I was married
to Rosie's son Gabo.

92
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,672
Very handsome.

93
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:32,308
Every girl wanted to marry him.

94
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:33,534
That's what he thought.

95
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,444
I don't know if I was
in love with him...

96
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,639
but he was already very
much in love with himself.

97
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,110
And anyway... no one
ever said no to Gabo.

98
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,340
Our wedding was the
talk of the town.

99
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,801
From food and drinks,
all the arrangements...

100
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,935
were simply the best.

101
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:51,042
Rosie did everything.

102
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,377
Gabo was so happy that day...

103
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:56,073
that he couldn't imagine
life getting any better.

104
00:09:58,067 --> 00:09:59,205
And for him, it didn't.

105
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:07,305
But life was looking
up for Rosie.

106
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,911
She now had an admirer.

107
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:11,913
A famous artist had
moved to Pocolim.

108
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:15,512
A magician with the paintbrush.

109
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,740
Every stroke of which...

110
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,244
earned him a standing
ovation from the art world.

111
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,008
They say that Don Pedro Cleto
Colaco has just one inspiration.

112
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:42,867
Women.

113
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:44,367
Big women.

114
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:56,173
I told you I'll set you up!

115
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:57,507
What are you doing here?

116
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,410
She's right here. Why
can't it be now?

117
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:00,973
She's busy.

118
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:03,010
You have to wait if you
want it done properly!

119
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,338
Wait for what?

120
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:05,837
The Second Coming?

121
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,044
You've been waiting
for 2000 years.

122
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,340
Any luck?

123
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:12,303
I can't talk right now.

124
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:13,633
Please leave.

125
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,937
Rumor has it, he's only
looking for only one thing...

126
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,275
his last inspiration.

127
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,675
And this... is Savio.

128
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:56,007
We were friends until
I broke his heart.

129
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:04,833
He just came back home...

130
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,073
after 6 years.

131
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:08,867
To no family.

132
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:10,077
Probably searching for some
imagined family treasure...

133
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:11,712
in this empty house, all alone.

134
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:22,976
He's a broken man.

135
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:25,268
And I did the breaking.

136
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:35,511
Savio, Gabo and I
grew up together.

137
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:38,810
Those two were inseparable...

138
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,600
but also fiercely competitive.

139
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,037
So when I told Savio that
I am marrying Gabo...

140
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,607
without saying a word,
he left Pocolim.

141
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,740
He returned after making
his fortune in Mumbai...

142
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,711
for his father's
memorial service.

143
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:02,878
There was no point
in coming earlier.

144
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,179
Rosalina had taken
care of everything.

145
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:08,237
Jesus Christ, what the...

146
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:10,367
Who is this?

147
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,576
You didn't recognize him?

148
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,667
It's your father.

149
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:16,273
But this was a
black-and-white photograph.

150
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,908
It was fully gone.

151
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:19,241
You couldn't even take
a good picture of him.

152
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:20,602
That's my fault too?

153
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,067
But why didn't you
use the original?

154
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:24,369
Look at him.

155
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:28,007
Are you talking about him?

156
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,771
Because he's dead.

157
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:29,342
Savio...

158
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:31,476
Savio, another word
from you and...

159
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:32,068
Hold on.

160
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:33,043
So this was also
my father's idea?

161
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,771
What did he say?

162
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:35,744
Paint my face pink.
Make me a clown.

163
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,108
This... this was Eddie's idea.

164
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:38,173
Who the hell is Eddie, Father?

165
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:39,541
Is he blind? Is he retarded?

166
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:42,580
Look, Savio... it's just a
little digital retouching.

167
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:43,667
BY Whom? A monkey?

168
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:45,840
Is Eddie a chimpanzee?

169
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:47,468
Is he a monkey?

170
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,300
No.

171
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:00,967
Ferdie.

172
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:06,803
Ferdie.

173
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:09,110
Ferdie.

174
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,879
I'm in the back side.

175
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,370
I think Savio Da Gama is back.

176
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,970
Return of the missing son.

177
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,738
Remember Savio?

178
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:43,237
What's this for?

179
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,246
This I'll light for my
broken heart Angie.

180
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:55,879
Hey, what happened?

181
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:00,607
Ferdie!

182
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:12,810
I knew it was you last night.

183
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:16,609
Continue like this, and...

184
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,547
everyone's going to think
that you're possessed.

185
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:21,733
Are you?

186
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,470
This is Assumption.

187
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:29,546
How can you even say that?

188
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:32,140
It's a mutton bill, Ferdie.

189
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:46,246
Stefanie Fernandes.

190
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,002
Fanny.

191
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,907
But why didn't you
post this letter?

192
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,539
I did.

193
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:58,235
It came back, last night.

194
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,880
After 46 years.

195
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:05,703
But you're in-charge
of the post...

196
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:07,269
so who gave it to you?

197
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:27,009
Ferdie, you proposed to her.
- Then what?

198
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:32,871
I asked her hand in marriage.

199
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:37,012
But she never replied because...

200
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,541
this letter was never
delivered to her.

201
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:42,739
You're damn angry...

202
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:46,210
46 years!

203
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:52,578
For 46 years I thought
she had rejected me.

204
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,945
What life is this?

205
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:00,969
Full lie I've lived.

206
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,871
Full lie I've lived, for something
that never even happened.

207
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:09,408
It's okay. - It's not okay.

208
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,643
Stefanie Fernandes was
and will always be...

209
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,145
the love of my life...

210
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:17,613
and she never even knew.

211
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,278
So why didn't you tell her?

212
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,040
I thought she'd say know.

213
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:26,877
But, if you don't ask...

214
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:28,674
how will you know what
her answer would be?

215
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,043
After waiting so long...

216
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:36,413
I wish I had kept waiting.

217
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,300
You've been crying?

218
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:11,705
None of your business.

219
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,540
This is Pocolim, Ferdie.

220
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,376
Out here, everyone's business
is everyone else's business.

221
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:25,467
Does it work?

222
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:27,833
None of your business.

223
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,077
It's funny.

224
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,271
How you can cry underwater?

225
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:47,178
Angie. Angie.

226
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,009
You're crying? - Yes, Mai.

227
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,245
But I think there's
a robber outside.

228
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:03,210
What are you doing?

229
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,879
Looking for the robber, Mai.

230
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,535
Are you mad or what?

231
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:08,753
You're making so much noise.

232
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:13,606
You'll scare him away.

233
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:18,168
Angie.

234
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,806
Go away.
- Who are you talking to?

235
00:22:19,867 --> 00:22:20,867
Go away.

236
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,333
The dogs.

237
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:24,410
These dogs. - They gone.

238
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,500
Come in.

239
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:26,204
They're gone.

240
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,712
I'll take care of their barking.

241
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,835
Mai...

242
00:22:35,533 --> 00:22:37,137
They always trouble my Nereus.

243
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,878
Go and sleep.
- Lock the door properly.

244
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:56,367
Ferdie.

245
00:22:57,267 --> 00:22:58,302
Ferdie.

246
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,369
What happened? - Is she gone?

247
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:03,633
Yeah.

248
00:23:03,767 --> 00:23:05,007
I had a dream.

249
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:06,267
What dream?

250
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:07,939
About Fanny.

251
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:09,133
Really?

252
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:10,867
And?

253
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,946
She was taking me to a church...

254
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,508
and she was saying
something to me.

255
00:23:18,867 --> 00:23:19,868
And?

256
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,504
Then I drowned me in the dream.

257
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:26,308
And then? - Then what?

258
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:28,871
What happened to Fanny?

259
00:23:29,133 --> 00:23:30,134
Oh she...

260
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,770
She was doing some...

261
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:41,510
Listen Ferdie, we
have to find Fanny.

262
00:23:42,133 --> 00:23:44,272
No, no, no, I drowned.

263
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:46,870
I'm telling you I drowned.

264
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:47,968
Look at me Ferdinand.

265
00:23:48,467 --> 00:23:49,467
Look at me.

266
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:54,007
Do you want to die
without telling Fanny...

267
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,603
that all your life,
you've loved only her?

268
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,109
No. - Then?

269
00:23:59,367 --> 00:24:00,607
I don't want to die.

270
00:24:02,267 --> 00:24:03,267
No, Ferdie.

271
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:09,772
No love story should be
left incomplete like this.

272
00:24:58,267 --> 00:24:59,267
Savio Da Gama.

273
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,401
He?'-

274
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:04,139
It's been 6 years, huh?

275
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:08,167
Looking good.

276
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:20,067
What's this?

277
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,803
My side-door neighbor brought
us some Tang, from Dubai.

278
00:25:23,134 --> 00:25:24,135
Side-door.

279
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:27,073
Six years Savvy, nobody
knows anything about you.

280
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:29,313
Whether you're alive, or dead...

281
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,700
or married?

282
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:35,540
You know Gabo died that day.

283
00:25:36,433 --> 00:25:38,743
Your train must have been
leaving from Goa at that time.

284
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,902
You didn't even attend his funeral.
Not even...

285
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,800
What was I supposed to
come back and do Angie?

286
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,601
Bring him back to life?

287
00:25:47,234 --> 00:25:48,736
No letter, not even
a phone call...

288
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,800
For what?

289
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,200
My friend died.

290
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,500
Felt like Shit.

291
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:55,207
By the time I found out...

292
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
he was already gone.

293
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:08,668
So...

294
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:10,967
did you get married?

295
00:26:19,034 --> 00:26:20,034
Looking good.

296
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,743
The car, looks nice.

297
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:27,505
Are you really selling it?

298
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,007
Do you want to buy it? - No.

299
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:33,613
It's for someone called 'SAL'.

300
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:40,867
So...

301
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,712
still pressing Rosie's feet?

302
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:46,778
Please, Savio, at
least I'm happy.

303
00:26:47,734 --> 00:26:49,008
Like always.

304
00:26:49,367 --> 00:26:50,903
So what's your problem?

305
00:26:51,633 --> 00:26:53,806
You know there's a world
outside Pocolim, right?

306
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,310
Life isn't easy here, but we
make the most of it, okay?

307
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,606
Really?

308
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,577
What do I know about problems?

309
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:05,042
Anyway-

310
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:08,409
I feel like I'm asking a
stranger for a favor.

311
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:10,203
What favor?

312
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:12,934
I need the car.

313
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:17,377
This is no longer my car.
- Then whose is it?

314
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:18,767
That artist.

315
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,708
That Pedro?

316
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:22,373
How did this happen?

317
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,743
Lots of money coming your way.

318
00:27:25,933 --> 00:27:27,071
Can't complain.

319
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,302
Stop pretending.

320
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:31,606
I've heard about your
big business in Mumbai.

321
00:27:31,933 --> 00:27:33,640
Well, yeah!

322
00:27:33,933 --> 00:27:35,207
Anyway, what do you
need the car for?

323
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,211
That stingy bugger won't
lend it to anyone.

324
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:41,613
You know that postmaster Ferdie?

325
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:43,412
He and I are going
on a short trip.

326
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:46,210
Running away with
the postmaster?

327
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,803
Yes... if the artist lends
me the car will you drive?

328
00:27:50,033 --> 00:27:52,707
He won't give it
unless you bribe him.

329
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,676
Rosie. Rosie.

330
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:43,872
Mrs. Eucharistica, Mr. Colaco.

331
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:45,002
Of course.

332
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:48,540
I want to make a
painting of you...

333
00:28:49,233 --> 00:28:51,679
for all the social
work that you do.

334
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,605
It will be shown in places
like Milan, New York, London.

335
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,076
I think it's a
wonderful idea, Mai.

336
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,335
No, no... I mean...

337
00:29:04,467 --> 00:29:05,912
But, come on you have to.

338
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,407
Yes but...
- You go to the church every day.

339
00:29:08,467 --> 00:29:09,605
Up and down. Up and down.

340
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,804
So much work you do.

341
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,340
You can at least do this much for yourself.
- It's God's work.

342
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:16,780
Can you see it, Madame Eucharistica?
- What?

343
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:20,814
Can you see yourself in
the painting, Madame?

344
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:29,378
Oh Rosie, it's my...
I mean, your future.

345
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:33,473
Can you see it please, now?

346
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:40,037
No. Not really.

347
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:02,045
I mean, sometimes I get a
little carried away, you see.

348
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:03,803
Don't worry.

349
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,105
Sometimes, Mai's also
in a different mood.

350
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:09,011
That's okay. But... - Nothing.

351
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:11,547
What you offered her was nice only.
- Yes, of course.

352
00:30:13,034 --> 00:30:15,412
You must be busy these days
with your foreign trips?

353
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:16,468
Busy?

354
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:19,576
I don't have the time
to breathe, darling.

355
00:30:19,633 --> 00:30:20,543
Oh...

356
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,580
Because we were
planning a road trip.

357
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,646
Who we? - Mai and me.

358
00:30:27,633 --> 00:30:29,635
I thought you'll get a
chance, you know...

359
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,940
to know her better.

360
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,677
But it's okay. Next time.

361
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:35,441
Time is what I don't have.

362
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:38,036
It's alright. - No, no, no, no.

363
00:30:39,067 --> 00:30:40,478
I'll adjust.

364
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,536
Everything happened
so fast that...

365
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:03,840
I'm sorry I didn't get a
chance to tell you earlier.

366
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:07,844
Anyway... I'll leave from Chapel
Point at 11 in the morning...

367
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,709
for a matter of
Christian charity.

368
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:13,841
I'm going to help Ferdie.

369
00:31:13,933 --> 00:31:16,573
He needs my help more than
anyone else in the world.

370
00:31:21,267 --> 00:31:23,804
Don Pedro has offered his
car for this journey and...

371
00:31:23,867 --> 00:31:25,938
of course, he's coming along.

372
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,936
Sweet of him, isn't it?

373
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,010
He couldn't stop going on about
how he wishes paint you.

374
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:33,113
All he keeps talking about is...

375
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:36,080
capturing your elegance
and beauty on canvas.

376
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:37,339
So flattering, isn't it?

377
00:31:39,067 --> 00:31:39,807
It started.

378
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,900
It started.

379
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:42,133
It started.

380
00:31:43,633 --> 00:31:46,614
I'll just have to be careful
of our driver, Savio.

381
00:31:47,234 --> 00:31:49,145
The way he looks at me
makes me uncomfortable.

382
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,607
But how will I stop him?

383
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,440
By looking at your photo.

384
00:31:53,534 --> 00:31:55,734
I will stop myself from getting
drawn into temptation...

385
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,641
You've always taught me to put
other's needs before ours.

386
00:32:02,233 --> 00:32:04,113
And now is the time to put
this into practice...

387
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:05,610
so the world will say
that Rosalina...

388
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:07,067
has taught her
daughter-in-law well!

389
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:26,767
What are you doing here?

390
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,837
There's a lady
coming on this trip.

391
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:31,877
You could've cleaned the car...

392
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,034
before bringing it here?

393
00:32:35,234 --> 00:32:36,941
I hope the seats are clean.

394
00:32:38,267 --> 00:32:41,248
Leather and sweat smell like
pigs' piss after a while.

395
00:32:41,734 --> 00:32:42,940
This is rexine, you idiot.

396
00:32:43,234 --> 00:32:44,304
You...

397
00:32:44,734 --> 00:32:45,769
What did you say?

398
00:32:46,867 --> 00:32:48,039
I said it's clean.

399
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
You...

400
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:52,846
She's here.

401
00:33:01,867 --> 00:33:03,642
The beautiful Angelina.

402
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,776
The glow on your cheeks
puts the sun to shame.

403
00:33:07,234 --> 00:33:09,271
And the Romeo of Romeos.

404
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:11,237
The Casanova of the Konkan.

405
00:33:13,967 --> 00:33:16,174
You're an inspiration to lovers.

406
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,173
I salute you, sire.

407
00:33:21,534 --> 00:33:24,538
And where's the
other lovely lady?

408
00:33:25,533 --> 00:33:26,739
She'll be coming, soon.

409
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,201
I'll be right back.

410
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:32,839
I'm here only.

411
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,605
Why are you holding my hand?

412
00:33:43,934 --> 00:33:46,141
Listen, before you
get furious...

413
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,476
let me tell you, this was
out of my control, okay.

414
00:33:48,634 --> 00:33:49,634
Lies.

415
00:33:50,167 --> 00:33:52,087
What did you expect me to say to him?
Don't come.

416
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:53,669
You tricked me into
driving this car.

417
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,178
What do you mean I tricked you?

418
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:56,542
This is his car, after all.

419
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,573
Listen, I just wanted to
get out this village.

420
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:02,607
Finally, I wanted to spend some time...
- I'm sorry.

421
00:34:02,767 --> 00:34:03,939
I had to help Ferdie.

422
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,570
So you lied.

423
00:34:11,234 --> 00:34:12,178
You know what, to hell with him.

424
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,600
And don't talk to me, just go.

425
00:34:16,267 --> 00:34:17,267
You know, Savio...

426
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,981
sometimes, you need to make
an effort to find love.

427
00:34:26,967 --> 00:34:28,037
Angie, this is why...

428
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,940
She's also coming along?!

429
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,646
Rosalina, the first
lady of Pocolim.

430
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,720
What a lovely day this is...

431
00:34:36,734 --> 00:34:38,534
that comes with the
privilege of your company.

432
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:40,935
My humble car awaits.

433
00:34:41,534 --> 00:34:42,740
Come. - Here.

434
00:34:44,033 --> 00:34:45,307
Why do you drop everything?

435
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:46,805
Are you butter fingers?

436
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:48,346
It moved.

437
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,011
Of course it moved, it's a cat.

438
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:53,333
Don...

439
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,304
Madame.

440
00:34:56,334 --> 00:34:58,712
What a lovely cat. Just
making a bit of noise.

441
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,902
Has it come to say
goodbye to us?

442
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,213
Will Nereus come along, Mai?

443
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,903
We need to discuss some
important things, young lady.

444
00:35:15,267 --> 00:35:16,268
Look here.

445
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:17,705
Come.

446
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:22,110
How will I face my Gabo...

447
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,806
if I can't even protect
his wife's purity?

448
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,943
Proud of you. - Thank you, Mai.

449
00:35:27,034 --> 00:35:29,674
And there's no one to
look after Nereus.

450
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,436
He'll be fine. He'll
stay with me.

451
00:35:32,634 --> 00:35:33,635
You take care of him.

452
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:38,333
You okay?

453
00:35:41,634 --> 00:35:43,375
What a lovely car, Don Pedro.

454
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,307
Yes, I thought so too when I
saw it for the first time.

455
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,240
Just needed a bit of repair.

456
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,335
Nothing much though.

457
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:54,239
Hey you, can you drive a
fine imported car like this?

458
00:35:55,034 --> 00:35:56,980
Hey, it's you I'm talking to.

459
00:35:57,367 --> 00:35:58,573
And good morning.

460
00:35:59,567 --> 00:36:01,647
Your mother must have forgotten
to teach you manners.

461
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:03,542
It's okay, I'll teach you.

462
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,938
You're asking me if I can drive?

463
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,509
I mean... are you qualified?

464
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,441
It's a foreign car after all.

465
00:36:12,433 --> 00:36:13,070
What?

466
00:36:13,134 --> 00:36:14,545
The gears are different.

467
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,670
Can anyone here drive this car?

468
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,642
Since you know a lot about foreign
cars and their bloody gears?

469
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:26,067
I can't...

470
00:36:29,234 --> 00:36:30,178
And since this is
Don Pedro's car...

471
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:32,907
and he doesn't know how
to drive, so who's left?

472
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,400
Huh, madam?

473
00:36:36,534 --> 00:36:38,445
I don't trust this
hooligan's driving.

474
00:36:56,734 --> 00:36:57,894
Everything should be alright.

475
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,071
<i>God mess.</i>

476
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:01,167
Okay Ferdinand...

477
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Thank you.

478
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,073
Ferdie, we really don't need
to make this small talk.

479
00:37:50,734 --> 00:37:51,734
Sorry.

480
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,120
There's something
strange on your face.

481
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:00,637
No... I mean.

482
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,838
Why are you speaking now?

483
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:10,944
Hey Ferdie, open the bottle.

484
00:38:11,734 --> 00:38:12,838
He couldn't even get water?

485
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:15,842
Couldn't even do this much?

486
00:38:19,534 --> 00:38:21,254
I keep doing work for
others all the time...

487
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,604
but no one cares.

488
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,772
I'm thirsty, one second.

489
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,337
Yuck! What is this?

490
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,900
What are you doing?

491
00:39:26,634 --> 00:39:27,634
What?

492
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,900
What am I doing?

493
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:30,434
What am I doing?

494
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:32,606
Yes, what are you doing?

495
00:39:34,534 --> 00:39:36,414
How much longer will I
have to wait, god dammit?

496
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:38,641
What are you saying?

497
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,304
So tell me, Ferdie, how come no Mrs.
Ferdie all these years?

498
00:39:57,434 --> 00:39:58,606
Oh...

499
00:40:00,934 --> 00:40:02,242
Just like that.

500
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:03,840
There was no one else...

501
00:40:05,567 --> 00:40:06,567
after Fanny.

502
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,411
She is for real, right?

503
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,704
Romeo without a Juliet.

504
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:19,767
Sorry.

505
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:23,771
I want to put this cat inside.

506
00:40:24,734 --> 00:40:25,734
Wipe your face.

507
00:40:52,234 --> 00:40:53,406
He looks alive, doesn't he?

508
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,401
What?

509
00:40:58,767 --> 00:41:00,647
Does anyone want to tell
Mai what just happened?

510
00:41:03,234 --> 00:41:04,234
Exactly.

511
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,543
So we'll stop somewhere on the
way and say a prayer for Nereus.

512
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:10,774
You mean, she'll
wake up and see...

513
00:41:10,867 --> 00:41:13,245
that Nereus passed
away in his sleep?

514
00:41:13,734 --> 00:41:14,735
Yeah.

515
00:41:48,934 --> 00:41:49,934
See... see.

516
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:51,674
Fanny's house.

517
00:41:53,734 --> 00:41:54,734
Happy?

518
00:41:55,134 --> 00:41:56,134
Come.

519
00:42:02,934 --> 00:42:04,414
This house is bigger
than your palace.

520
00:42:04,967 --> 00:42:05,967
Pretty, no?

521
00:42:06,167 --> 00:42:08,113
Pretty, like my Fanny.

522
00:42:10,234 --> 00:42:11,234
This is it, sir.

523
00:42:11,734 --> 00:42:12,906
It's your show from now.

524
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:14,703
Come on, you Romeo.

525
00:42:15,067 --> 00:42:16,637
No more thinking.

526
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,038
Make or break.

527
00:42:27,134 --> 00:42:28,134
Ferdie.

528
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:29,667
Hey...

529
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,500
Go get him.

530
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,472
Get him.

531
00:42:35,867 --> 00:42:36,867
Ferdie. Ferdie.

532
00:42:37,034 --> 00:42:38,035
Ferdie, wait up.

533
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:40,367
Ferdie.

534
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,579
Ferdie, wait. Wait.

535
00:42:44,433 --> 00:42:45,537
What if...

536
00:42:48,434 --> 00:42:50,141
What if she doesn't
recognize me?

537
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,501
Mad or what?

538
00:42:51,934 --> 00:42:53,641
Who would forget a
personality like yours?

539
00:42:54,834 --> 00:42:56,336
Yes, I haven't changed much.

540
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,509
I'm the same. - Yes.

541
00:42:58,767 --> 00:43:00,087
So there's nothing
to worry about.

542
00:43:04,067 --> 00:43:05,774
Yeah. Show her your
romantic side.

543
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,405
There are thorns everywhere.

544
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,906
Show. Show.

545
00:43:24,167 --> 00:43:25,737
Ferdie. Hold this.

546
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Stupid.

547
00:43:28,234 --> 00:43:29,674
You should've got
some other flowers.

548
00:43:30,134 --> 00:43:31,670
Why did you pluck roses?
- Savio said.

549
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,472
I look alright?

550
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,300
Excuse me, sir.

551
00:44:21,334 --> 00:44:23,109
We're looking for
Stefanie Fernandes.

552
00:44:23,367 --> 00:44:24,812
Of course, you are.

553
00:44:25,767 --> 00:44:27,474
She's waiting for you.

554
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,711
You must come in, please.

555
00:44:32,934 --> 00:44:34,345
Come, come.

556
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,475
Welcome to my home!

557
00:44:38,067 --> 00:44:40,479
She married a foreigner? - No.

558
00:44:40,534 --> 00:44:41,638
He's a bloody hippie.

559
00:44:41,867 --> 00:44:43,938
Russian. I'll handle it.

560
00:44:58,034 --> 00:44:59,377
What is he talking?

561
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:06,111
What do you want my friend?

562
00:45:08,634 --> 00:45:11,240
An umbrella would be nice,
but we're looking for...

563
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:13,041
What's her name?
- Stefanie Fernandes.

564
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,811
This is her husband, he
wants to tell her that.

565
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,670
Not like that.

566
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:23,006
This morning,
Stefanie Fernandes...

567
00:45:23,867 --> 00:45:26,871
runs away with my umbrella.

568
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,840
With your umbrella?

569
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,808
This morning?

570
00:45:31,867 --> 00:45:34,609
You must all sit.

571
00:45:37,467 --> 00:45:39,140
I come back.

572
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,604
Any pictures of Fanny?

573
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:52,313
I can't really tell.

574
00:45:54,734 --> 00:45:57,146
My name is Vladimir llyanova.

575
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,441
But you can call me
Vladimir llyanova.

576
00:46:06,334 --> 00:46:06,869
Both.

577
00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:08,173
Hey you?

578
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:11,238
Why you have brought yellow
flowers to my house.

579
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,541
Don't you know it's bad luck?

580
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,908
They are for Fanny.

581
00:46:15,234 --> 00:46:16,872
What is funny?

582
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,278
Fanny. - This is not funny.

583
00:46:19,334 --> 00:46:21,405
Stefanie Fernandes, remember?

584
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,207
Sir, Stefanie
Fernandes your wife?

585
00:46:27,567 --> 00:46:29,103
My wife...

586
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,271
My wife is in Russia, long dead.

587
00:46:34,967 --> 00:46:36,412
And my mother...

588
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:38,901
Can I offer...

589
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,412
Why are you doing this to me?

590
00:46:41,634 --> 00:46:44,342
Please take them outside.

591
00:46:47,367 --> 00:46:48,367
Excuse me.

592
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,276
This man has come looking
for Stefanie Fernandes.

593
00:46:51,534 --> 00:46:52,535
You know her, right?

594
00:46:54,434 --> 00:46:55,469
Vladimir?

595
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,142
Vladamir.

596
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,010
My mother named me Vladimir.
- Sir.

597
00:47:00,267 --> 00:47:02,873
You bought this house
from Stefanie Fernandes?

598
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,370
20 more years ago.

599
00:47:06,567 --> 00:47:07,739
Wonderful lady.

600
00:47:08,167 --> 00:47:10,169
She moved to Tivoli...

601
00:47:10,367 --> 00:47:13,246
that is few hours on the
other side from here.

602
00:47:14,567 --> 00:47:17,514
The government made
a lot of problems..

603
00:47:17,567 --> 00:47:19,706
"About selling to a foreigner.

604
00:47:20,567 --> 00:47:24,515
But... I had married an Indian.

605
00:47:25,267 --> 00:47:28,476
So... I got lucky.

606
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,510
Lovely lady Stefanie Fernandes.

607
00:48:39,367 --> 00:48:40,767
Just star-t the car
when I tell you.

608
00:48:44,334 --> 00:48:46,371
Savio. - Yes.

609
00:48:46,667 --> 00:48:47,737
Thanks.

610
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,272
For what?

611
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:52,839
I love her.

612
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:54,941
I really love her.

613
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,677
Hey, Savio.

614
00:49:36,634 --> 00:49:37,772
Tell you a secret?

615
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,300
Yeah...

616
00:49:41,767 --> 00:49:44,941
You know Albert and I
were shippies together.

617
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,336
Rosalina's husband, Albert.

618
00:49:49,467 --> 00:49:50,502
I heard.

619
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,909
We sailed together
that last time...

620
00:49:55,767 --> 00:49:59,340
just before he never came back.

621
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,838
So you were on the
ship when he died.

622
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,243
He didn't die.

623
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,308
He did not die. - What?

624
00:50:09,633 --> 00:50:10,907
Just never came back.

625
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:14,581
Just wrote her a letter saying
he's never coming back.

626
00:50:15,467 --> 00:50:16,468
Gave me to give her.

627
00:50:17,367 --> 00:50:19,404
But... wasn't there
a big memorial?

628
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,946
Rosalina, the pregnant widow...

629
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,377
Husband buried at sea.

630
00:50:24,267 --> 00:50:26,907
He found a girl in Madagascar.

631
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:28,475
Jumped ship, disappeared.

632
00:50:28,867 --> 00:50:31,108
What I mean is why
tell such a big lie?

633
00:50:35,167 --> 00:50:36,167
Of course.

634
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:38,967
Pride.

635
00:50:39,434 --> 00:50:41,778
Her bloody pride.

636
00:50:43,467 --> 00:50:45,174
That's why she hates
me, you know.

637
00:50:45,567 --> 00:50:46,967
Because I am the
only one who knows.

638
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,511
Apart from her and Albert.

639
00:50:50,367 --> 00:50:51,573
Now you know.

640
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,612
That explains her bitterness.

641
00:50:55,567 --> 00:50:56,807
Promise you won't tell her.

642
00:50:57,767 --> 00:50:58,973
Then why you told me?

643
00:51:01,734 --> 00:51:03,179
Be nice to her.

644
00:51:06,967 --> 00:51:07,968
Sometimes.

645
00:51:09,934 --> 00:51:10,934
Sometimes.

646
00:52:23,267 --> 00:52:24,940
When I was small, I
used to be an angel...

647
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
in feasts.

648
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,407
Do you want to hear a song?

649
00:52:42,434 --> 00:52:43,572
Okay then.

650
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,472
Either this car
doesn't use petrol...

651
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,294
or we need to get some
when we get to Tivoli.

652
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,805
You want to hear some songs
I wrote about Fanny?

653
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:31,609
No Ferdie, I would like to
know where that right turn is.

654
00:53:31,734 --> 00:53:32,974
It'll come.

655
00:53:33,067 --> 00:53:34,637
It'll come on the right.

656
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,645
Oh my little pussy.

657
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,276
Pussy. Pussy.

658
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:15,038
Pussy. Pussy.

659
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,100
Pussy.

660
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,373
You're such an
animal lover, Pedro.

661
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,306
Madame.

662
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,844
I've never loved an
animal as much as this...

663
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,408
lively little fellow.

664
00:54:26,434 --> 00:54:29,847
Give him to me, must be hungry.

665
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:30,742
No, no, no.

666
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,303
I assure you that
he's quite stuffed.

667
00:54:34,234 --> 00:54:36,771
Come, my little baby.

668
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,308
Come, come, come.

669
00:54:42,867 --> 00:54:44,312
That's it. On the right.

670
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,238
Stop. Stop the car.

671
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,103
Stop the car. - Why?

672
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,474
Stop the car.

673
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,572
Hello, everyone.

674
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,276
I just want you to say.

675
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,080
I could not have done
this without you all.

676
00:55:03,267 --> 00:55:05,027
What man, now you're
giving a speech or what?

677
00:55:06,867 --> 00:55:09,677
My Fanny's village
is just up ahead.

678
00:55:16,334 --> 00:55:19,042
I hope my hear-t doesn't
burst with happiness.

679
00:55:21,367 --> 00:55:23,142
When I meet Fanny...

680
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,712
I'll talk to her
only with my eyes.

681
00:55:28,967 --> 00:55:30,310
Might be a blessing.

682
00:55:31,434 --> 00:55:33,154
Why don't you do the
same for us, you idiot?

683
00:55:33,767 --> 00:55:34,871
Talk with your eyes only.

684
00:55:43,067 --> 00:55:46,310
Anyway... you all
made it possible.

685
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,079
Especially you, Angie.

686
00:55:49,334 --> 00:55:51,143
My hear-t was like a bird...

687
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,737
that could not fly.

688
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:56,804
It would never be able to fly...

689
00:55:56,867 --> 00:55:58,403
if it wasn't for you.

690
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,141
Thank you, Ferdinand.

691
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,577
Fernando. Fernando.

692
00:56:02,767 --> 00:56:04,440
Fanny always used to
call me Fernando.

693
00:56:07,767 --> 00:56:09,178
Not a bad speech.

694
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:12,776
You should have one ready
for Fanny if you see her.

695
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:15,100
Everybody ready?

696
00:56:15,967 --> 00:56:16,967
Everyone ready?

697
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,806
Start the car. Start the car.

698
00:56:18,867 --> 00:56:20,312
Everyone ready?

699
00:56:22,933 --> 00:56:24,037
Faster. Faster.

700
00:56:24,134 --> 00:56:25,841
Faster. Faster.

701
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,600
Give me the map.

702
00:56:36,667 --> 00:56:37,509
Why?

703
00:56:37,567 --> 00:56:39,308
You idiot, we're in
bloody Karnataka.

704
00:56:42,734 --> 00:56:44,236
Means what?

705
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:46,809
Means we've crossed
into another state.

706
00:56:47,834 --> 00:56:48,834
What state?

707
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,545
A bloody mental state.

708
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,938
He's shouting.

709
00:56:52,334 --> 00:56:53,472
Mad he's become or what?

710
00:56:56,267 --> 00:56:58,110
And you... please explain.

711
00:56:58,667 --> 00:57:00,613
When did I say I can read a map!

712
00:57:06,767 --> 00:57:10,374
The days in which I
had to fall in love.

713
00:57:10,733 --> 00:57:13,737
I spent all those days
writing letters to you.

714
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,304
O Fanny Re...

715
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,979
O Fanny Re...

716
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:25,478
All the happiness's of my life.

717
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:29,105
Got killed as I was lost in the
thoughts of Your whereabouts.

718
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,113
O Fanny Re...

719
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,303
O Fanny Re...

720
00:57:36,834 --> 00:57:40,407
O my beloved!

721
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,844
O Fanny Re...

722
00:57:44,567 --> 00:57:49,016
O Fanny Re...

723
00:57:49,067 --> 00:57:50,067
Now what?

724
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:51,712
Now... now what? We've
run out of petrol.

725
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:55,112
O Fanny Re...

726
00:57:58,834 --> 00:57:59,869
Savvy...

727
00:58:01,933 --> 00:58:03,037
Savio.

728
00:58:04,034 --> 00:58:05,034
Yeah, what?

729
00:58:05,333 --> 00:58:06,333
What are you doing?

730
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,343
Getting that bloody
idiot out of my system.

731
00:58:08,834 --> 00:58:10,745
I didn't sign up for this bullshit.
- Oh, sorry.

732
00:58:10,834 --> 00:58:11,834
For what?

733
00:58:12,067 --> 00:58:14,911
My fault, trusting that
fool to read a map.

734
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,280
It's like a chimpanzee
reading Shakespeare.

735
00:58:17,367 --> 00:58:19,574
It's not that bad.
- Not that bad?

736
00:58:20,067 --> 00:58:21,637
And that painter bullshitter!

737
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,475
Madame this. Madame that.

738
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:24,873
What Madame?!

739
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,670
She's just a fat old cow.

740
00:58:28,134 --> 00:58:29,442
They are old people, Savvy...

741
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,342
and old people will
be old people.

742
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,936
You can't change that. - Right.

743
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,360
They get away with a lot
of shit, old people.

744
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,367
Good excuse.

745
00:58:35,667 --> 00:58:37,044
If you stay alive long enough..

746
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,220
People eventually forget
that you were born stupid.

747
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,038
What's your problem?

748
00:58:41,534 --> 00:58:42,706
You've more than most people do.

749
00:58:42,767 --> 00:58:45,008
So why are you complaining all the time?
- One second.

750
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:45,874
What do I have?

751
00:58:45,934 --> 00:58:46,934
What do I have?

752
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,074
20 dentures.

753
00:58:48,167 --> 00:58:50,374
10 shins, 5 pants, 3
socks and 2 underwear.

754
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,874
That's all dear daddy left me.

755
00:58:52,234 --> 00:58:53,542
Oh, did I forget to mention?

756
00:58:53,634 --> 00:58:54,977
One bloody falling down house.

757
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,377
Well, I can't complain.

758
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:00,504
I never had any daddy,
dentures or house.

759
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,604
Oh, please, spare me your
little orphanage sob story.

760
00:59:03,767 --> 00:59:05,212
Poor Angie, alone in this world.

761
00:59:05,267 --> 00:59:07,067
You let her rule over you.
That's your choice.

762
00:59:22,167 --> 00:59:23,475
Look, Angie, I'm sorry.

763
00:59:23,934 --> 00:59:25,607
I really have nothing
against you.

764
00:59:26,534 --> 00:59:30,346
And if anything,
you're the only one...

765
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,504
If it wasn't for you...

766
00:59:35,967 --> 00:59:37,247
I would've killed
someone by now.

767
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,100
Listen...

768
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:45,540
maybe if we plan wisely..

769
00:59:45,633 --> 00:59:47,476
We can do up the
house slowly-slowly.

770
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,339
Till then I'll come and
help you clean the house.

771
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,404
What?

772
00:59:56,967 --> 00:59:58,105
What?

773
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,909
There's no money
in Mumbai, Angie.

774
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:07,676
But the business?
- What business?

775
01:00:09,067 --> 01:00:10,910
I was a bloody
waiter for 5 years.

776
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,376
Slept on the same
tables I served.

777
01:00:18,067 --> 01:00:19,239
So you lied.

778
01:00:27,934 --> 01:00:29,345
I'll still help you
clean the house.

779
01:00:33,567 --> 01:00:34,637
For free.

780
01:00:40,634 --> 01:00:42,136
Lomos Del Toro.

781
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,973
One of the finest brandies
known to man, Madame.

782
01:00:52,833 --> 01:00:53,937
This is good.

783
01:00:56,167 --> 01:00:57,167
You're classy.

784
01:00:57,533 --> 01:00:58,533
Classy, Don Pedro.

785
01:00:58,734 --> 01:00:59,804
Indeed, Madame.

786
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:04,241
I see that you have a fine palette
of a sailor on shore leave.

787
01:01:05,367 --> 01:01:07,540
No doubt that you got
it from your husband.

788
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:09,207
Husband.

789
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,938
May his soul rest in peace.

790
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:18,938
You think he's watching?

791
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,535
Let him.

792
01:01:22,934 --> 01:01:24,971
I mean why should he alone
have fun in heaven?

793
01:01:27,834 --> 01:01:30,474
He had lots of fun, nonstop.

794
01:01:31,134 --> 01:01:33,740
These sailors, dirty people.

795
01:01:34,667 --> 01:01:36,647
No respect for their
wives at home.

796
01:01:36,867 --> 01:01:38,710
But my Albert wasn't like that.

797
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:41,110
My Albert was very faithful.

798
01:01:41,834 --> 01:01:44,212
If I were your
husband, Madame...

799
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,813
I wouldn't go away from
you even for a moment.

800
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,673
All lies. You men all lies.

801
01:01:50,334 --> 01:01:52,814
If you don't go to
work, who'll earn?

802
01:01:52,867 --> 01:01:54,073
Your father?

803
01:01:55,133 --> 01:01:56,510
Of course.

804
01:01:57,967 --> 01:01:59,537
How is the brandy, dear lady?

805
01:02:01,034 --> 01:02:04,413
Call me Rosie no,
nobody else does.

806
01:02:06,334 --> 01:02:07,870
Rosie.

807
01:02:14,667 --> 01:02:16,544
Now the picture is perfect.

808
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,680
I used to miss you
in the beginning...

809
01:02:20,634 --> 01:02:24,446
until I started enjoying
thinking about you.

810
01:02:25,534 --> 01:02:26,534
About us.

811
01:02:27,467 --> 01:02:28,707
You know I used to make
up my own stories.

812
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,713
About what could've happened if
things had gone differently.

813
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,704
If... life hadn't changed...

814
01:02:35,934 --> 01:02:37,311
or you hadn't left Goa...

815
01:02:40,234 --> 01:02:41,872
Mumbai wasn't easy.

816
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:45,106
Memories were all I had...

817
01:02:47,334 --> 01:02:48,506
So it's a deal then?

818
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:51,502
What deal?

819
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:57,207
I want the old Savio back.
Same old...

820
01:03:03,267 --> 01:03:04,439
Jesus Christ, what the
hell was that for?

821
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,780
You've gone mad or what, Savio?!

822
01:03:05,933 --> 01:03:06,933
I've gone mad?

823
01:03:07,267 --> 01:03:08,109
So what were you thinking?

824
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,420
I'm good for a little charity,
a little house-clean...

825
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:11,738
but a peck on the lips
and I've gone mad?

826
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,006
What am I thinking?

827
01:03:13,267 --> 01:03:14,439
What are you thinking?

828
01:03:14,534 --> 01:03:17,572
So what was all that
'we' stuff about?

829
01:03:17,634 --> 01:03:18,635
We'll clean the house.

830
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:19,970
What was all that about?

831
01:03:20,033 --> 01:03:22,513
We, Savio. You and I,
aren't we even friends now?

832
01:03:22,734 --> 01:03:23,734
Friends?

833
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,571
Aren't you fed up of
this friends bullshit?

834
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,560
Back then we were friends,
now we're friends!

835
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:34,838
Why the hell did you
say yes to him...

836
01:03:34,934 --> 01:03:36,743
when you knew you loved me more?

837
01:03:40,767 --> 01:03:41,802
Why?

838
01:03:43,134 --> 01:03:44,613
Just because he asked you first?

839
01:03:46,534 --> 01:03:47,535
No, Savio.

840
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,838
Because you never asked.

841
01:03:59,934 --> 01:04:01,709
Are you mad creeping
up like this?

842
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,175
I would've knocked
but there's no door.

843
01:04:04,334 --> 01:04:07,178
You could have at least cleared
your throat or something...

844
01:04:07,234 --> 01:04:09,214
My throat is not blocked.
- Okay.

845
01:04:10,133 --> 01:04:13,444
I came to tell you all...

846
01:04:14,367 --> 01:04:15,573
my decision.

847
01:04:16,834 --> 01:04:19,371
Romeo of Pocolim is going
to make another speech.

848
01:04:20,567 --> 01:04:22,513
Anyway, I want you
all to know...

849
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:26,709
that tomorrow morning I
am going for petrol.

850
01:04:28,367 --> 01:04:29,903
The only reason I
am not going now...

851
01:04:29,967 --> 01:04:32,004
is because I am
scared of the dark.

852
01:04:33,034 --> 01:04:34,809
And I can't cure that overnight.

853
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,007
It is almost impossible...

854
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,409
to conquer the fear of
the dark in the day.

855
01:04:40,767 --> 01:04:41,871
Too much light.

856
01:04:46,734 --> 01:04:48,111
And also there's.

857
01:04:48,333 --> 01:04:49,641
I am scared of snakes.

858
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,304
There are too many
snakes in Goa.

859
01:04:52,134 --> 01:04:53,272
For the first time,
Ferdinand is thinking.

860
01:04:53,367 --> 01:04:57,611
About somebody else
instead of himself.

861
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,104
I'm impressed.

862
01:05:01,734 --> 01:05:03,008
Do whatever you like.

863
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,180
I'm not in a hurry to go home...

864
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:06,611
as long as she's by my side.

865
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:07,610
Your choice.

866
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:09,646
You stay here, go back...
Whatever.

867
01:05:11,334 --> 01:05:12,813
I am going to look for Fanny.

868
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:21,044
Wait. Ferdie, come here.

869
01:05:21,134 --> 01:05:22,306
Come, come.

870
01:05:22,567 --> 01:05:23,671
Have some brandy.

871
01:05:24,634 --> 01:05:26,545
There is no third glass, Madame.

872
01:05:26,834 --> 01:05:28,814
Come. Sit, drink from my glass.

873
01:05:29,067 --> 01:05:30,067
Come.

874
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,670
Listen, I don't want to fight.

875
01:06:01,967 --> 01:06:03,002
Listen Angie, screw you.

876
01:06:03,067 --> 01:06:04,187
What have you come back for?

877
01:06:04,234 --> 01:06:05,611
I don't want your sympathy.

878
01:06:06,167 --> 01:06:07,475
You think you're very tough...

879
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:10,140
to use whatever language you
choose to especially with a girl?

880
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:13,377
Girl?
- I'll smack your face, Savio.

881
01:06:14,034 --> 01:06:15,308
I'm not scared of you
or your language...

882
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,277
or your stupid attitude.

883
01:06:17,567 --> 01:06:19,012
Go away, I've nothing
to say to you.

884
01:06:19,167 --> 01:06:20,976
That's always been the
problem with you.

885
01:06:23,367 --> 01:06:24,812
You think something was there?

886
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,640
What did you think was there?

887
01:06:26,967 --> 01:06:29,311
You and I were..

888
01:06:30,867 --> 01:06:32,778
We were close, remember.

889
01:06:33,167 --> 01:06:34,407
We were 18, Savio.

890
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,671
No, you were 18, I was 20.

891
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,109
Shit. I'm such an idiot.

892
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,873
Why didn't I just say it then?

893
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:45,027
You know, you're
worse than Ferdie.

894
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,876
He at least said it but
Fanny never heard.

895
01:06:48,767 --> 01:06:52,510
But you... proud
Savio Da Gama...

896
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,307
couldn't say what
was in your heart.

897
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:55,903
No, Angie...

898
01:06:58,634 --> 01:06:59,942
Now let me speak, okay.

899
01:07:01,467 --> 01:07:03,640
The first time I was kissed
was on my wedding day.

900
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,278
And 15 minutes later my
husband choked and died..

901
01:07:07,367 --> 01:07:08,812
On his own wedding cake.

902
01:07:10,967 --> 01:07:12,913
It's not the chicken
bone as the story goes.

903
01:07:14,167 --> 01:07:16,647
The bride and groom figurines on
the cake were made of plastic.

904
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,074
Not icing.

905
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,245
His mother was trying
to save money.

906
01:07:23,734 --> 01:07:25,680
And her son was so drunk that.

907
01:07:26,067 --> 01:07:28,707
By the time he realized it
was halfway down his throat.

908
01:07:32,834 --> 01:07:35,280
That was my first and last
kiss and it was 6 years ago.

909
01:07:38,467 --> 01:07:40,879
You think I did something
wrong by slapping you today?

910
01:07:42,434 --> 01:07:43,434
Huh?

911
01:07:43,534 --> 01:07:44,808
Is your ego hum?

912
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,035
Where does it hum?

913
01:07:55,234 --> 01:07:56,269
You think after
waiting 6 years...

914
01:07:56,367 --> 01:07:58,438
a girl would not like
it to be done properly?

915
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:00,600
No...

916
01:08:01,234 --> 01:08:02,406
I mean yes.

917
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:07,402
So then finish what you started.

918
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,277
Sure about this, I mean..

919
01:08:14,467 --> 01:08:15,810
I don't really...

920
01:08:19,167 --> 01:08:21,943
No, I've had too much already.

921
01:08:22,267 --> 01:08:23,473
You have.

922
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:25,702
Forget it.

923
01:08:27,467 --> 01:08:29,913
Too much liquor is bad
for me, you know.

924
01:08:30,567 --> 01:08:32,103
It affects my legs.

925
01:08:34,167 --> 01:08:35,167
Gout?

926
01:08:35,667 --> 01:08:36,771
No.

927
01:08:39,434 --> 01:08:40,811
It makes them spread.

928
01:08:44,933 --> 01:08:46,776
You remember the
old days, Ferdie?

929
01:08:46,867 --> 01:08:49,780
Albert, you and me, we
used to have so much fun.

930
01:08:52,667 --> 01:08:53,475
Ferdie.

931
01:08:53,667 --> 01:08:54,702
Ferdie, thanks.

932
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,239
You always knew about
Albert and me.

933
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:03,004
That bastard.

934
01:09:08,334 --> 01:09:11,781
I never asked you to... but
still you didn't tell.

935
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,810
Thanks for keeping my secret...

936
01:09:18,467 --> 01:09:19,537
a secret.

937
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,236
Thanks Ferdie.

938
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:30,300
Angie.

939
01:09:32,534 --> 01:09:33,774
Angie, you okay?

940
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:40,804
Would you like a cigarette?

941
01:09:41,934 --> 01:09:43,777
Like a tradition afterwards.

942
01:09:51,234 --> 01:09:52,440
Angie, really are you okay?

943
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:54,238
I am okay. Just...

944
01:09:55,334 --> 01:09:56,642
lying and watching the stars.

945
01:09:58,367 --> 01:10:00,047
Look here, I want to
make sure you're okay.

946
01:10:01,367 --> 01:10:02,367
I am okay.

947
01:10:03,767 --> 01:10:05,007
Talk to me, baby.

948
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,371
Despite what everyone says
about men wanting to...

949
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:11,137
turn around and fall
asleep after...

950
01:10:12,134 --> 01:10:13,408
That's also a tradition?

951
01:10:20,567 --> 01:10:23,104
I thought she's going
to come and check.

952
01:10:24,301 --> 01:10:25,301
Who?

953
01:10:27,701 --> 01:10:29,112
You were making bit of a sound.

954
01:10:30,767 --> 01:10:32,041
What are you mumbling about?

955
01:10:33,534 --> 01:10:34,877
Angie, you know who?

956
01:10:37,534 --> 01:10:39,104
Again you're talking about Mai.

957
01:10:41,234 --> 01:10:43,214
Why are we always
talking about Mai?

958
01:10:43,534 --> 01:10:45,172
Don't be naive, Angie.

959
01:10:46,934 --> 01:10:49,073
What are you going to
tell Rosie about us?

960
01:10:50,034 --> 01:10:51,034
Mad or what?

961
01:10:51,334 --> 01:10:52,574
Why will I tell her anything?

962
01:10:53,767 --> 01:10:54,802
What do you mean?

963
01:10:55,767 --> 01:10:57,110
This is a one-time
thing for you?

964
01:10:57,634 --> 01:10:58,669
That's all this is?

965
01:10:59,234 --> 01:11:00,304
I didn't say that.

966
01:11:01,034 --> 01:11:04,015
I'm hoping there'll
be many more times...

967
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:07,013
and I'm hoping it will
get better also, no?

968
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:08,700
Better?

969
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:12,804
What do you mean better?

970
01:11:13,634 --> 01:11:15,045
Is this the best it ever gets?

971
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,905
No... but... I mean..

972
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:21,637
So, better?

973
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,275
My sky. - What?

974
01:11:35,067 --> 01:11:36,740
You're in the way of my sky.

975
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:39,835
Yeah, fine.

976
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,200
Hey!

977
01:11:51,067 --> 01:11:52,705
Listen, if I had
not come to you...

978
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:54,487
you would still be sitting
here and sulking.

979
01:11:56,034 --> 01:11:57,513
So let me do what I want no...

980
01:11:59,734 --> 01:12:00,734
Better?

981
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,879
Somebody should go with Ferdie.

982
01:12:38,367 --> 01:12:39,710
He won't know what to get.

983
01:12:40,534 --> 01:12:42,844
You think he'll bring back
apple juice in a jerry can?

984
01:12:45,301 --> 01:12:46,644
But what if he gets lost?

985
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,970
He got lost a long time ago.

986
01:12:53,401 --> 01:12:54,539
Somebody's coming.

987
01:12:54,867 --> 01:12:56,972
Bring back some apple juice.

988
01:13:04,534 --> 01:13:06,514
Good morning. - Morning.

989
01:13:13,767 --> 01:13:16,043
Someone should look
out for Ferdie.

990
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:20,304
Of course, you go.

991
01:13:20,501 --> 01:13:21,571
You and M.F Hussain.

992
01:13:22,034 --> 01:13:22,910
You look out for him...

993
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,480
while Hussain can
look at more of you.

994
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,873
Don't think I don't know what's
going on in your dirty mind.

995
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:29,300
My dirty mind?

996
01:13:29,467 --> 01:13:30,947
Wait till he takes
out his paintbrush.

997
01:13:30,967 --> 01:13:32,241
Then tell me dirty mind.

998
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:33,772
I don't want to talk to you.

999
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,707
The moment is at hand, my lady.

1000
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:43,861
What are you going
to do with this?

1001
01:13:44,367 --> 01:13:49,043
With this brush I will
awaken the soul that...

1002
01:13:50,334 --> 01:13:51,904
exists within this
beautiful body.

1003
01:13:52,934 --> 01:13:54,675
And put colors on to it...

1004
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:56,937
the world does not
have names for yet.

1005
01:13:57,767 --> 01:13:59,405
With each dab of paint...

1006
01:14:00,801 --> 01:14:03,475
I will give your
beautiful soul..

1007
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,279
A new skin.

1008
01:14:08,467 --> 01:14:12,381
God will wish he had left the
creation of women to Pedro.

1009
01:14:20,734 --> 01:14:21,735
Angie, I am sorry.

1010
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:23,475
Sorry for being such an idiot.

1011
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,340
I don't know much
about these things.

1012
01:14:28,934 --> 01:14:30,004
And I don't smoke.

1013
01:14:32,601 --> 01:14:33,636
But maybe if I did...

1014
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:36,369
I would be the one who would want
to roll over and smoke a cigarette.

1015
01:14:36,434 --> 01:14:37,936
After we make love.

1016
01:14:40,567 --> 01:14:41,773
Do you understand?

1017
01:14:43,067 --> 01:14:44,067
Yes.

1018
01:15:13,167 --> 01:15:14,168
Put your hands up!

1019
01:15:15,834 --> 01:15:16,972
And stay there!

1020
01:15:33,601 --> 01:15:34,601
Madame Eucharistica.

1021
01:15:35,034 --> 01:15:36,874
Drop the cloth a little
off the other shoulder.

1022
01:15:37,901 --> 01:15:39,710
I am not so sure. - Drop it.

1023
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:44,545
This is an, my dear.

1024
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,104
No compromises.

1025
01:15:49,934 --> 01:15:53,381
Don Pedro, I'm not
comfortable wearing this...

1026
01:15:57,034 --> 01:15:58,240
I assure you, Madame.

1027
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:00,777
This sheet is not
even in my painting.

1028
01:16:02,067 --> 01:16:03,307
So, stay like this.

1029
01:16:08,767 --> 01:16:09,767
Yes, that's better.

1030
01:16:19,234 --> 01:16:20,394
Where the hell are those two?

1031
01:16:21,167 --> 01:16:23,147
Don Pedro is painting
a portrait of Mai.

1032
01:16:24,201 --> 01:16:25,201
And she agreed?

1033
01:16:26,434 --> 01:16:27,572
It's for the church.

1034
01:16:29,234 --> 01:16:30,234
Church?

1035
01:16:31,734 --> 01:16:33,614
You have not seen the
famous Don Pedro's work...

1036
01:16:37,334 --> 01:16:38,334
Church.

1037
01:16:38,967 --> 01:16:40,469
This is beautiful.

1038
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,446
Seldom have I been so wrong...

1039
01:16:50,267 --> 01:16:51,267
in recognizing someone.

1040
01:16:51,567 --> 01:16:52,671
How can somebody so
magnificent to look at.

1041
01:16:52,734 --> 01:16:55,146
Be so completely
empty from the inside?

1042
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,443
Where had your mind been...

1043
01:16:59,634 --> 01:17:01,978
while your body was
working its magic...

1044
01:17:03,001 --> 01:17:06,141
filling itself out, becoming a
deadly lure for the artist.

1045
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:10,438
You know the hardest pan of
finishing this painting, Madame?

1046
01:17:14,167 --> 01:17:15,167
Your eyes.

1047
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,377
Where is your soul?

1048
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:20,471
I do not see.

1049
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,635
So...

1050
01:17:23,734 --> 01:17:25,372
I had to make it up.

1051
01:17:29,067 --> 01:17:31,946
It's like making love to you
and thinking of another.

1052
01:17:34,667 --> 01:17:35,667
You're free to go.

1053
01:17:36,534 --> 01:17:37,534
I am done with you.

1054
01:18:02,934 --> 01:18:07,610
Dear Angie, madam Rosalina,
Don Pedro and Savio...

1055
01:18:09,534 --> 01:18:11,411
sorry for dragging
you all into this.

1056
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:14,345
But I needed you all
to help me start.

1057
01:18:16,867 --> 01:18:19,404
I don't expect you to
understand my love for Fanny.

1058
01:18:19,767 --> 01:18:21,440
I understand it hardly.

1059
01:18:22,167 --> 01:18:23,874
What I understand is this.

1060
01:18:23,967 --> 01:18:26,208
You won't find
anything by waiting...

1061
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:28,246
but only by searching.

1062
01:18:31,834 --> 01:18:34,314
Angie, you're the
daughter I never had.

1063
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:36,674
And you're the wife I
hope Fanny will be.

1064
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,946
And I wish my mother
had been like you.

1065
01:18:41,934 --> 01:18:44,847
Whoever you touch is the
luckiest bugger in the world.

1066
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:46,846
Even if they don't know it then.

1067
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:50,402
Don Pedro, I'm sure
you'll make...

1068
01:18:50,467 --> 01:18:52,879
"the lovely madam Rosalina
famous in your painting.

1069
01:18:54,534 --> 01:18:57,174
I hope each one of you fulfils
something in your life.

1070
01:18:58,534 --> 01:19:00,707
Will I see you again?
Maybe, maybe not.

1071
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,137
I don't know.

1072
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,237
Good. Now we can go back.

1073
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,946
I guess it's his own
journey from here on.

1074
01:19:13,134 --> 01:19:14,306
I mean...

1075
01:19:14,867 --> 01:19:16,707
we were meant to be with
him only up till here.

1076
01:19:20,834 --> 01:19:21,834
Come.

1077
01:19:25,567 --> 01:19:27,342
Wait. - It's time to go home.

1078
01:19:28,901 --> 01:19:30,505
What do you mean by going home?

1079
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:33,670
How can we go without Ferdie?

1080
01:19:33,934 --> 01:19:36,813
Have you all gone mad?

1081
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:38,743
Let go.

1082
01:19:38,834 --> 01:19:41,144
And you... you don't care
about anybody else..

1083
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,305
"But yourself. - Mai...

1084
01:19:43,367 --> 01:19:45,369
You're selfish, you selfish...

1085
01:19:45,434 --> 01:19:48,108
Good for nothing.
That's what you are.

1086
01:19:49,667 --> 01:19:51,544
It should've been you that day.

1087
01:19:51,767 --> 01:19:53,269
Not my Gabo.

1088
01:19:54,134 --> 01:19:55,909
Gabo shouldn't have died.

1089
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,638
Leave me, Angie.

1090
01:19:59,534 --> 01:20:01,104
Do you know why he married her?

1091
01:20:01,167 --> 01:20:02,167
Do you know?

1092
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,905
Because he always
wanted what you wanted.

1093
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:08,603
God takes away the good and
leaves behind the trash.

1094
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,104
My Gabo should've lived..

1095
01:20:11,167 --> 01:20:13,167
You should've died.
- This is not Pocolim, okay.

1096
01:20:13,234 --> 01:20:14,736
This isn't your house.

1097
01:20:14,801 --> 01:20:16,474
Or your daddy's village.

1098
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:18,776
And I am selfish?

1099
01:20:18,834 --> 01:20:20,541
I am selfish? - Yes.

1100
01:20:20,967 --> 01:20:22,207
All your life you've
been strutting around...

1101
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:23,244
parading your false pride!

1102
01:20:23,334 --> 01:20:24,074
And I am selfish?

1103
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:26,579
Shut up.
- I'll show you who's bloody selfish, wait.

1104
01:20:26,767 --> 01:20:27,438
Where are you going?

1105
01:20:27,534 --> 01:20:29,946
Mai. - Where are you
going now, you coward.

1106
01:20:30,801 --> 01:20:32,405
Don't you do anything to my cat.

1107
01:20:32,501 --> 01:20:35,880
Cat. Your bloody precious cat.
Here.

1108
01:20:36,134 --> 01:20:37,977
Your bloody cat has been
dead this whole time.

1109
01:20:38,034 --> 01:20:39,707
As dead as your bloody son.

1110
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Have you fed it once?

1111
01:20:41,001 --> 01:20:42,309
Looked after it once?

1112
01:20:42,501 --> 01:20:44,606
Are we your pop's servants
to take care of it...

1113
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:46,060
while you pose
around like a model?

1114
01:20:50,034 --> 01:20:51,809
And now suddenly Ferdie
this, Ferdie that.

1115
01:20:52,434 --> 01:20:54,004
All your life you treat
him like shit...

1116
01:20:54,067 --> 01:20:55,375
and now suddenly it's Ferdie.

1117
01:20:55,567 --> 01:20:57,012
Ferdie my ass!

1118
01:20:58,667 --> 01:20:59,805
Done with this shit.

1119
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,979
Hey, you found daddy's gun.
- Let me die.

1120
01:22:16,034 --> 01:22:17,980
Found his gun..
- Let me die. Let me die.

1121
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:28,835
You found his gun.

1122
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:30,180
Thank you so much
for finding it.

1123
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,480
Do you know how much it's worth?

1124
01:22:32,234 --> 01:22:33,304
How much?

1125
01:22:34,667 --> 01:22:35,975
How much?

1126
01:22:37,267 --> 01:22:38,371
What are you doing?

1127
01:22:38,567 --> 01:22:39,841
We're going back? - What?

1128
01:22:41,101 --> 01:22:42,381
I don't know what
I was thinking.

1129
01:22:42,434 --> 01:22:44,380
We'll have to go
back for Ferdie.

1130
01:22:44,434 --> 01:22:45,242
For Ferdie?

1131
01:22:45,434 --> 01:22:46,708
I am the one who
slipped the letter..

1132
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,840
Under his door that night.

1133
01:22:47,867 --> 01:22:48,867
What?

1134
01:22:50,134 --> 01:22:52,174
Found it when I was going
through daddy's old stuff.

1135
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:53,642
Like everything else in life..

1136
01:22:53,901 --> 01:22:55,642
Daddy must have messed up again.

1137
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,807
Yes, now I remember.

1138
01:22:59,234 --> 01:23:01,874
Jesus Christ, you think
even this is about you?!

1139
01:23:02,434 --> 01:23:04,004
It's about your
daddy, you idiot.

1140
01:23:04,334 --> 01:23:05,836
Loyolla was the
postmaster that time.

1141
01:23:07,967 --> 01:23:10,277
Daddy was surely a
man of many talents.

1142
01:23:34,067 --> 01:23:35,808
Ferdie! Ferdie! Ferdie!

1143
01:23:36,234 --> 01:23:38,009
Ferdie! - Ferdie!

1144
01:23:38,101 --> 01:23:38,841
Ferdie!

1145
01:23:38,934 --> 01:23:40,413
Stop the car.
- Are you mad, stop the car!

1146
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,446
Shit the bloody car's brakes are failed!
- Stop the car.

1147
01:23:42,567 --> 01:23:43,807
Stop the car, Savio.

1148
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:45,538
The brakes have failed!!

1149
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,045
Give it to me. - Stop the car.

1150
01:23:47,134 --> 01:23:48,943
Mad woman, leave the steering.

1151
01:23:51,501 --> 01:23:53,503
Stop.
- Leave the steering, you fat cow.

1152
01:23:53,567 --> 01:23:55,547
Give me the steering.
- Stop her, Angie.

1153
01:23:56,234 --> 01:23:58,908
Savio..

1154
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:07,842
I don't want to die.

1155
01:24:07,934 --> 01:24:08,708
You stupid fat cow.

1156
01:24:08,767 --> 01:24:10,041
Bloody two minutes back you
wanted to kill yourself.

1157
01:24:10,134 --> 01:24:11,654
Now you don't want to die.
Are you mad?

1158
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,800
Stop the car. Stop the car. Savio, please.
- Leave.

1159
01:24:31,634 --> 01:24:32,669
Mai!

1160
01:24:33,767 --> 01:24:35,007
Mai!

1161
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:37,270
Mai!

1162
01:24:38,134 --> 01:24:39,134
It's okay.

1163
01:24:39,434 --> 01:24:40,469
It's okay.

1164
01:24:40,734 --> 01:24:42,042
Come, come.

1165
01:24:42,167 --> 01:24:43,373
Where are we?

1166
01:24:51,301 --> 01:24:52,575
We are okay.

1167
01:24:54,434 --> 01:24:55,344
Idiot.

1168
01:24:55,434 --> 01:24:56,435
Move.

1169
01:24:58,534 --> 01:24:59,808
I nearly died.

1170
01:25:00,467 --> 01:25:01,741
So did we.

1171
01:25:13,267 --> 01:25:14,267
Hey...

1172
01:25:15,801 --> 01:25:16,973
where's Don Pedro?

1173
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,320
I saw that bloody
selfish bastard.

1174
01:25:19,367 --> 01:25:21,074
He jumped off to save himself.
- No.

1175
01:25:21,267 --> 01:25:23,027
I asked for help and he
slapped my hand away.

1176
01:25:23,967 --> 01:25:25,776
I saw that, Mai. - You're okay?

1177
01:25:29,067 --> 01:25:30,137
Don Pedro.

1178
01:25:30,234 --> 01:25:31,304
Hey“

1179
01:25:31,367 --> 01:25:32,243
Hey“

1180
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:35,281
Go, go, run you selfish
coward bastard.

1181
01:25:35,334 --> 01:25:36,334
Go!

1182
01:26:15,467 --> 01:26:16,810
Great.

1183
01:26:17,567 --> 01:26:19,308
Even after reaching,
we can't reach.

1184
01:26:21,501 --> 01:26:23,447
Let's find out where she lives?

1185
01:26:31,934 --> 01:26:33,140
Oh, my God!

1186
01:26:34,934 --> 01:26:36,106
Fanny!

1187
01:26:36,367 --> 01:26:37,607
Which one?

1188
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:40,100
Where?

1189
01:26:47,267 --> 01:26:48,940
Come on, Ferdie, go for it.

1190
01:26:49,834 --> 01:26:51,836
You've waited your
entire life for this.

1191
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:06,438
No, l... l think I'll wait only.

1192
01:27:07,034 --> 01:27:09,014
Ferdie. Hey, Ferdie.

1193
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Go on.

1194
01:27:33,634 --> 01:27:34,635
You sure?

1195
01:27:48,101 --> 01:27:49,101
Ferdie, wait.

1196
01:28:34,201 --> 01:28:35,201
Fanny.

1197
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:38,301
Fanny.

1198
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,172
It's me, Ferdie.

1199
01:28:42,634 --> 01:28:43,634
Fanny.

1200
01:28:43,934 --> 01:28:45,140
What the hell are you doing?

1201
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:48,204
Oh, I am sorry.

1202
01:28:50,401 --> 01:28:52,176
I thought you were Fanny.

1203
01:28:52,767 --> 01:28:53,939
Who the hell is Fanny?

1204
01:28:54,001 --> 01:28:56,538
Fanny. Stefanie Fernandes.

1205
01:28:58,101 --> 01:28:59,307
Just get away.

1206
01:29:00,734 --> 01:29:02,077
Stefanie is my mother.

1207
01:29:05,434 --> 01:29:06,708
Where is she?

1208
01:29:14,034 --> 01:29:15,034
No...

1209
01:29:16,234 --> 01:29:17,234
It can't be.

1210
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:18,601
No.

1211
01:29:19,634 --> 01:29:20,942
It can't be.

1212
01:29:37,234 --> 01:29:38,234
Are you...

1213
01:29:39,701 --> 01:29:40,941
You're sure it is her?

1214
01:29:42,634 --> 01:29:43,634
Means what?

1215
01:29:44,534 --> 01:29:46,104
She doesn't look like..

1216
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:50,940
She's wearing a wedding dress.

1217
01:29:51,867 --> 01:29:54,279
Shouldn't she be..
- Recently married, no?

1218
01:29:57,267 --> 01:29:58,610
I knew it.

1219
01:30:00,401 --> 01:30:04,178
My Fanny waited for
me all these years.

1220
01:30:04,934 --> 01:30:06,572
And now she got married.

1221
01:30:06,934 --> 01:30:08,242
Fourth time...

1222
01:30:10,867 --> 01:30:13,780
What did you say your name was?
- Ferdie.

1223
01:30:15,834 --> 01:30:16,869
Ferdinand.

1224
01:30:18,867 --> 01:30:21,143
She used to call me Fernando.

1225
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:29,170
Did she... ever
mention that name?

1226
01:30:32,267 --> 01:30:33,405
Yes... l guess there was..

1227
01:30:35,134 --> 01:30:36,909
No, that was Kennedy.

1228
01:30:37,434 --> 01:30:40,972
And then there were
Joe, Joel, Jacinto...

1229
01:30:42,001 --> 01:30:44,140
John, Peter, Joe.

1230
01:30:45,001 --> 01:30:46,503
Mai mentioned many, many names.

1231
01:30:47,301 --> 01:30:48,746
What a colorful life she had.

1232
01:30:49,767 --> 01:30:51,405
But no, sorry.

1233
01:30:51,967 --> 01:30:53,878
She never mentioned
any Fernando.

1234
01:31:34,901 --> 01:31:36,346
And that was it, really.

1235
01:31:36,534 --> 01:31:38,844
We set out like brave
adventurers to find love.

1236
01:31:39,867 --> 01:31:40,868
Look at us...

1237
01:31:40,967 --> 01:31:43,447
None of us would know love..

1238
01:31:43,534 --> 01:31:45,070
If it punched us in the nose.

1239
01:31:50,667 --> 01:31:52,510
Pretending like we knew
anything about anything...

1240
01:31:52,567 --> 01:31:53,807
in the first place.

1241
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,580
Pretending like we
were wiser now.

1242
01:32:01,534 --> 01:32:03,411
I wanted to tell Ferdie
that it was okay.

1243
01:32:04,301 --> 01:32:05,575
But he wouldn't understand.

1244
01:32:10,634 --> 01:32:12,477
I wanted to tell him
that people die..

1245
01:32:12,734 --> 01:32:14,270
"But love never does.

1246
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:21,173
As for Don Pedro, his pan in
our lives was only that much.

1247
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:27,179
I guess he must be stroking
his paintbrush somewhere.

1248
01:32:27,267 --> 01:32:29,508
Thinking about Rosie with
his strange kind of love.

1249
01:32:30,534 --> 01:32:33,174
So yeah, love never dies.

1250
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:35,812
It's always there, somewhere.

1251
01:32:36,734 --> 01:32:38,736
And sometimes you
just have to find it.

1252
01:32:41,134 --> 01:32:44,843
Even if there's no unsent
letter waiting at your door.

1253
01:32:46,101 --> 01:32:48,411
If love doesn't come
knocking, just knock.

1254
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:50,645
Even if there is no door.

1255
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:41,881
Our time is now now now now

1256
01:33:42,434 --> 01:33:44,914
Hey you, c'mon you

1257
01:33:45,001 --> 01:33:46,912
You sing and I hear

1258
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,412
Laughter in your eyes is clearer

1259
01:33:50,134 --> 01:33:51,943
I just want you nearer

1260
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:55,376
Whrill me, frill me

1261
01:33:55,434 --> 01:33:57,710
Right now and maybe after

1262
01:33:57,767 --> 01:34:00,304
King and queen and up high

1263
01:34:00,367 --> 01:34:02,870
Dreaming gold life style

1264
01:34:03,201 --> 01:34:06,705
The sky was high but we believed

1265
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:09,239
We here to stay

1266
01:34:09,601 --> 01:34:11,672
