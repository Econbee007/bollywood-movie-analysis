1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,999
Tobacco use leads to cancer..

2
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:15,999
Heart attacks, lung disorders
and other deadly diseases.

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,790
The characters shown
in this film or programme..

4
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:22,457
Do not support the use of
any type of tobacco products..

5
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:25,957
Such as Bidi, Cigarettes,
Khaini, Zarda etc..

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,040
Or their promotion in any manner.

7
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,832
Tobacco use leads to cancer..

8
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:36,165
Heart attacks, lung disorders
and other deadly diseases.

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,249
The characters shown
in this film or programme..

10
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,695
Do not support the use of
any type of tobacco products..

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,832
Such as Bidi, Cigarettes,
Khaini, Zarda etc..

12
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,749
Or their promotion in any manner.

13
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:51,707
A human's lungs are like
sponge which are made to breath air.

14
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:53,874
But some people..

15
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:56,040
Use the lungs to breath..

16
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,082
Beedi and cigarette smoke.

17
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,749
If you squeeze the lungs of..

18
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,665
A man who smokes.

19
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,790
Then you'll get cancer producing tar..

20
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,082
In such high quantity that..

21
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,082
So much tar can make you sick.

22
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:17,624
It is enough to make you really sick.

23
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:20,499
We see 50 patients daily.

24
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,374
Approximately a 1000 in a month.

25
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,832
80% or 90% mouth cancer..

26
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,499
Happens by chewing tobacco.

27
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,165
This is Mukesh's story.

28
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,415
My name is Mukesh.

29
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,165
I used to chew tobacco.

30
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,457
I've got cancer now,
my operation is due.

31
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,624
Probably, I can't say anything more.

32
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:39,374
Alas, Mukesh couldn't survive.

33
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:42,249
He was 24 years old.

34
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:45,124
Tobacco, betel leaf,
chewing tobacco, paan masala..

35
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,165
Everything is dangerous.

36
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:15,208
"Like you need breaths.."

37
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,207
"..to live life.."

38
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,915
"When you're on the verge of dying.."

39
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:26,415
"..you'll realize some
important facts of life."

40
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,374
"And, one of them would be..

41
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,832
"..that, girls and rockets
can take you any limits."

42
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,332
"Look, that's me."

43
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:39,707
'They completely rearranged my face.'

44
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:43,665
'30 minutes ago,
I was standing on my own two feet.'

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,665
'Just 20 minutes ago, they 11 bones..'

46
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,249
"..and cracked my skull."

47
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,124
'Murari was right.'

48
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,415
'This mess was created by me.'

49
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,332
'But someone's love had
become the bane of my life.'

50
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,999
'But my story doesn't start here.'

51
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,999
'My story starts at Banaras.'

52
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:06,540
- All hail Lord Shiva.
- All hail Lord Shiva.'

53
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,832
'All hail Lord Shiva.'

54
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,332
'l was a free soul.'

55
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,915
It was not just difficult
but impossible to catch me.'

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,999
'All hail Lord Shiva.
All hail Lord Shiva.'

57
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,999
'All hail, sir.'

58
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,999
Uncle Rameshwar, out with some money.

59
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,790
This time we'll burn
Ravana's effigy in a way..

60
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,124
That no one would dare
to burn Ravana's effigy again.

61
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,332
But why are you dressed
like Lord Shiva to ask..

62
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,332
For donation for Dussehra?

63
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,582
You should have dressed
up like Rama, right?

64
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:33,415
Would Rama himself have
come to ask for donation..

65
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,540
To save his own wife?

66
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:36,999
Would he have liked that?

67
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,207
That's why he sent me.

68
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,040
After all, I am His special friend.
Am I not?

69
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,874
- Here you go.
- All hail Lord Shiva.

70
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,332
Bindiya. Brother, did you see Bindiya?

71
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,999
- No.
- That Kundan will spoil her.

72
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,082
- Hide, hide.
- Bindiya.

73
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,082
Seems like your father has come,
Bindiya.

74
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,665
Go. Or else all of us would
get beaten up because of you.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,281
You are scared because my
father is a policeman, isn't it?

76
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,707
I am scared of nobody.

77
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,790
Your father has messed up my life.

78
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,999
Okay. Hold on. I'll call him.

79
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,207
Papa.

80
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,165
Please. Quiet. Quiet.

81
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,249
I shall be doomed if I don't
rip off your father's clothes one day.

82
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,749
Come on.

83
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,082
All hail Lord Shiva.

84
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,999
Uncle, we've come from
the third lane of Hanuman Phatak.

85
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,999
For donation.
As we have to burn Ravana's effigy.

86
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,332
Hope you won't burn down someone else.

87
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,624
Uncle, if you think this is a lie.
You can come there and check.

88
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:25,999
Give it. Give him the receipt.

89
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,832
Here. 100 rupees.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,582
- Okay. Junaid. Get 100 rupees.
- Yes.

91
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,499
Murari, we...

92
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:47,249
'That day,
that very moment, that very second..'

93
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,457
'..it felt as if Lord Shiva
had answered all my prayers. '

94
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,249
'200 years ago the king
of Banaras had brought..'

95
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,374
'..my forefathers from
a village in Tamil Nadu.'

96
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,540
'To be his personal priests.'

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,582
'But it felt as if Banaras
had accepted me today.'

98
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,332
'This was Banaras's first gift to me.'

99
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,315
'She was the one offering prayers..'

100
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
'..but it felt as if
my prayers had been answered.'

101
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,999
'l was still a kid.'

102
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
'But all of a sudden
it felt as if I was an adult.'

103
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,040
'Old enough to marry.'

104
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:18,582
'Old enough to live and
die in that girl's love.'

105
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:59,749
"All I demand is you."

106
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:03,832
"All my immaturity is limited to you."

107
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:09,790
"All my eyes look for are you."

108
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,499
"You give me joy as well sorrow."

109
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:20,915
"Only you. Only you. Sweetheart."

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,749
"All I want is you.
But it's all up to you."

111
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:32,832
"All my hardships are limited to you."

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,874
"All my intelligence
is limited to you."

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,332
"All I prepare for is you. Only you."

114
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:45,124
"Only you."

115
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,874
“I am smitten by you and you only."

116
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,707
You dare tease the
girl of our territory.

117
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:21,249
- Dogs have territories.
- Lions have guts.

118
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,624
Darn you.

119
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:23,874
Hey... don't beat me. Okay.

120
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,832
I will beat you to
an inch of your life.

121
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,790
Murari. Don't let them get away.
Catch him.

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,832
Look aunt, these scoundrels
have been beaten up again.

123
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,076
They were teasing with girls.

124
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,999
Aunty, we only fell down, She's lying.

125
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:44,041
"Delicate. And shy.
Delicate. My heart lets out a tune."

126
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:57,124
"Your eyes are mesmeric."

127
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:05,708
"Don't give me those mesmeric looks."

128
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,915
"To you. All the roads lead to you."

129
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:14,082
“I'm drawn to you.
All I want is to meet you."

130
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:22,375
“I'll meet you. Only you. Only you."

131
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:31,833
"Fiery face. And the dark eyes."

132
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,874
"We fight and squabble."

133
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,374
"You seem to be mine.
And sometimes you seem like a dream."

134
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:46,915
"When you look at me."

135
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:55,583
"Your eyes pierce straight
through my heart."

136
00:09:56,125 --> 00:10:03,790
"You control my destiny."

137
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:12,500
"How do I get out of this dilemma?"

138
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:28,458
"Only you.
Only you. Only you, sweetheart."

139
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:36,499
"All I want is you.
But it's all up to you."

140
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:40,707
"All my hardships are limited to you."

141
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:44,874
"All my intelligence
is limited to you."

142
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,999
"All I prepare for is you. Only you."

143
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:52,999
"Only you."

144
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:58,415
“I am smitten by you and you only."

145
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:05,987
Someone will take your girl away.

146
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,665
And you will be left
licking your wounds.

147
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,665
What do you mean?

148
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,190
I mean if you don't express it now..

149
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,457
You'll be seen eating
sweets in the girl's wedding.

150
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,749
Sanju!

151
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,832
"Only you. Only you."

152
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,499
"My smartness is limited to you."

153
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,790
"My youth is all for you."

154
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,749
"My smartness is limited to you."

155
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,915
"My youth is all for you."

156
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,999
"My story ends on you."

157
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,374
"My story ends only on you."

158
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:41,458
"Only you. Only you."

159
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,499
I love you.

160
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,832
Did he scare you? Go.

161
00:11:56,875 --> 00:12:00,040
I'll slap you and you'll
stop flirting around.

162
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,707
I am prepared for that. Here.

163
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:08,874
Tell me your name at least.

164
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,249
Come tomorrow again to
get slapped and I'll tell you.

165
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:23,125
“I'm in love.
Someone come and check on me."

166
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:39,332
“I locked eyes with her smack
in the middle of the market."

167
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:47,583
“I'm in love.
Someone come and check on me."

168
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:55,540
“I have locked eyes at a tender age."

169
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,540
- It's my last board paper tomorrow.
- Very nice.

170
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,082
Come and meet me at
the fort at Ganga's banks.

171
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,874
At 5.

172
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:08,749
And listen. I'm meeting
you because of your consistency.

173
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,249
Not out of love.

174
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,207
No matter the reason. Just meet me.

175
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,999
Leave the rest to destiny.

176
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,900
You have slapped me 15 times.
Tell me your name at least now.

177
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,915
- Zoya.
- Zoya.

178
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,332
- And yours?
- Rizwan.

179
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,332
Rizwan.

180
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,915
Oh my! You look cool.

181
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,540
Why? Can't I?

182
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,332
No. You can. Why not?

183
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,915
But mister,
I know whom you are pursuing.

184
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,249
Heard that you're going to the fort
today to show that witch the moon.

185
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,415
You are a witch. Get lost.

186
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,957
- Great. Great. Love her and beat me.
- Lay off.

187
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,249
You are looking nice, mister.

188
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,707
If that witch casts
an evil eye on you..

189
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,082
Then you'll have to marry me.

190
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:59,249
Why don't you ever show me the moon?

191
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,957
Go count the stars, Bindiya.

192
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,874
Go to hell.

193
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,999
Your heartbeat is saying something.

194
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,457
It says something...

195
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:15,207
Your heartbeat is saying something.

196
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,499
What happened?

197
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,249
What is this?

198
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,957
I bought the I love you card in haste.
Thought you would take of fence.

199
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:05,040
- So I bought this.
- You are a bumpkin.

200
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,999
Is this any way to propose to a girl?

201
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:25,124
Listen to your heart first.
Then let your eyes take control.

202
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,999
Your heartbeat is saying something.

203
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:34,040
I suggest you should
listen to your heart.

204
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:47,790
Your eyes are glistening in the sun.
The sun...

205
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,957
Sorry, I forgot.

206
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,582
If this is you...
then I have been smitten by you.

207
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:18,124
- What is your name?
- Rizwan.

208
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,874
And your father's?

209
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,457
Mirza Galib.

210
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,082
You didn't think? Did you?

211
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,165
'This was the sixteenth slap.'

212
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,290
'But I was happy to have kissed her.'

213
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,332
'Rather than be sad about the slap.'

214
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,374
I hate liars.

215
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,332
'What could be better than
a wife of sound character?'

216
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,832
'But I was a Banarasi priest.
Dark at that.'

217
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,915
How could I accept defeat?

218
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,874
In U.P. girls are cajoled in two ways.

219
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,624
First is dedication.
Follow her around all day.

220
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,249
Write love letters,
and ask her friend to deliver it.

221
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,749
But, every boy in U.P was doing that.

222
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,332
'But I wasn't a handsome hunk.'

223
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,040
'To have passed by doing all this.'

224
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,457
'So I failed.'

225
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:04,999
Now, the second way.

226
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,790
Scaring the girl.

227
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:07,999
What are you doing?

228
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,540
If you stop the vehicle you'll
not be able to drive it from tomorrow.

229
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,332
- What's the problem?
- You're the problem.

230
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,376
- Don't chase me around.
- So whom should I chase?

231
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,332
I don't know. But don't chase me.

232
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,374
Say that you don't love me.

233
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,749
I don't love you.

234
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,040
Just because I am a Hindu.

235
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,165
If you say I'll read
out the Kalma(holy book).

236
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,790
You are a liar.

237
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:32,207
Say that you don't love me.
Or I'll slit the wrist.

238
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,207
Mine.

239
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,957
I don't love you.

240
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,249
What are you doing?

241
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,915
I've suffered enough humiliation.

242
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,767
You'll leave for
Aligarh tomorrow itself.

243
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,207
Go to your aunt's place.
And study there.

244
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:19,124
Just think, sir.
The boy is Hindu.

245
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,707
We'll be disgraced in society.

246
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,671
What about your daughter who flirts
around with the entire neighbourhood?

247
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,915
How dare you come here
to complain about me?

248
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,499
- Get lost.
- Keep quiet.

249
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,957
Keep quiet.

250
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,207
Is this the age to be doing all this?

251
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,582
And from where did
you learn to misbehave?

252
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,176
You'll be leaving for
Aligarh tomorrow itself.

253
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,624
Kundan, your father-in-law's sending..

254
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,540
Your wife away to Aligarh,
forcefully.

255
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,499
Hurry up, or you will miss her.

256
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,874
Find another Ram, he's gone for good.

257
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,582
Your papa and I love you a lot.

258
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,874
But what you've done
will not be tolerated.

259
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,749
Study hard, Zoya.

260
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,082
And remember what we said.

261
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,665
And don't get down at any station.

262
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:13,458
Zoya!

263
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,332
Are you blind?

264
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,665
Zoya, don't worry.
I'll wait for you.

265
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:44,957
You bet. By the time you
return everything would've changed.

266
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,665
Waiting for you. Always.

267
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:55,707
'That day I realised that heart
is neither on the left or right.'

268
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,582
'It is in the center.'

269
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,999
'Because there is
where I felt the pain.'

270
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,374
'But I wasn't dead yet.'

271
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:08,582
'Because this wasn't the
end of the story by any means.'

272
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:12,415
'l was yet to reach my prime.'

273
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:19,082
No, Kundan.

274
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,665
Let papa go.

275
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:31,707
Kundan! This isn't right.

276
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,280
I'll punish both of you in jail.

277
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,124
I'm ready to go to jail.
Just let me colour you once.

278
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,874
- Beware, Murari. I'll kill you.
- Catch him.

279
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,790
Tear his clothes off.

280
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,415
Kundan, the arms of law are very long.

281
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,540
And so are the legs of criminals.

282
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,540
Careful, papa.

283
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,457
Kundan.

284
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,915
Hail Mahadev!

285
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,707
You're always doing as you want.

286
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:24,957
Papa was on duty.

287
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,540
You think you're funny.
I'll show you.

288
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,832
You are a rascal.

289
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,624
Will you rip off just
my father's clothes?

290
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,540
Kundan is not that easy to get,
Bindiya.

291
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,511
If you think you can entice me with
your beauty then you are so wrong.

292
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,374
Your competition is returning.

293
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,290
Rascal. Darn you and that witch.

294
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,457
Even after 8 years, you're
still in love with her, isn't it?

295
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:21,207
- Go to hell, Kundan.
- Murari.

296
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:22,915
You are great.

297
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,915
She'll die a torturous death. I swear.

298
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,957
Vultures will feast on her,
and you too.

299
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,499
What news you've given me!

300
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:38,249
"Come. Come back to your love."

301
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:43,999
"Someone's waiting for you."

302
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:53,125
"My luck will change.
My luck will change."

303
00:22:56,166 --> 00:23:03,457
"For the better. For the better."

304
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:17,749
"There is chaos and music everywhere."

305
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,832
"You've left to come to me."

306
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:24,374
"Love is in the air.
Sweetheart, please show up."

307
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:28,374
“I am madly in love with you."

308
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:32,374
"You are the only one I have."

309
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:37,124
"You light up my life."

310
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,624
"You are the only one I have."

311
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,457
"You are my world."

312
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:53,582
"You are the only one I have."

313
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,499
"My body is grooving.
My heart's thumping."

314
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,540
"In waiting for you."

315
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:25,707
"The entire world knows
what's in my heart."

316
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:27,999
"Only I know what's in your heart."

317
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:32,332
"Let me feel a little more love."

318
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:36,540
"Show me a little more love."

319
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:40,665
“I'm madly in love with you."

320
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:48,958
"You are the only one I have."

321
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:06,082
“I see vibrancy all around. Everything
seems to have come to life."

322
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:10,374
“I'm so proud of myself.
I have lost control."

323
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:14,540
“I see vibrancy all around. Everything
seems to have come to life."

324
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:18,832
“I'm so proud of myself.
I have lost control."

325
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:23,040
"Come and whisk me away."

326
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:27,290
"Come and take me away with a smile."

327
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,457
"There is chaos and music everywhere."

328
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:31,582
"You've left to come to me."

329
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:36,540
"Love is in the air.
Sweetheart, please show up."

330
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,415
Seems like sir's car has broken down.

331
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,582
To hell with the sir.

332
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,790
Are you going to meet
her in front of him?

333
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:44,999
- Hold the wrench.
- Yes.

334
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:46,165
Lord Shiva is on our side.

335
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,957
Not just Lord Shiva.
Even the spark plug of the sir's car..

336
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:50,499
Is on our side.

337
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:52,332
Murari, you are genius.

338
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:57,457
Run, quickly. I'll handle here.

339
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,249
- Is there a problem?
- No.

340
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:13,665
Don't be so unfair.
Let's carry one bag at least.

341
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,165
We talked to him for two hours.

342
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,582
Let him do work worth
200 bucks at least.

343
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:18,827
- Shall I give him the books as well?
- Sure. Go ahead.

344
00:26:58,541 --> 00:27:00,040
What? She just didn't recognize you?

345
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,540
Right. She just passed by.

346
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:08,499
But Murari, she is really beautiful.

347
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,915
Even Katrina Kaif pales
in comparison to her.

348
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,040
Yes, she is your Katrina Kaif.

349
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,207
And both,
she and Katrina don't recognize you.

350
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,249
- How is it going, Kundan?
- Hello, aunty.

351
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:26,499
But Kundan,
we haven't run out of gas yet?

352
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:28,457
- Aunty, it's the festive season.
- Yes.

353
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:30,540
- You will not get it later.
- That's right.

354
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:32,082
Come. Keep it here.

355
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:37,540
Okay, Kundan. Look, the sink
pipe has started leaking again.

356
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:38,707
Please change it.

357
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,249
Okay. I'll check.

358
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:46,082
And the servicing of the
Fiat was not up to the mark.

359
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,040
We had to go pick
up Zoya this morning.

360
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,707
And it just wouldn't start.

361
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:53,082
- I need to check the spark plug.
- Yes.

362
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:19,290
So brother... did she recognize you?

363
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:23,457
Did she recognize you?

364
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,707
It means that this
girl has lost her memory.

365
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:32,082
Take her to some doctor.

366
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:34,407
She will refuse to come.
But still, take her to a doctor.

367
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:36,540
Come on. Get lost. Go.

368
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:38,624
Okay. All hail Lord Shiva.

369
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,457
How are you?

370
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:54,999
I am good now.

371
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:57,284
That is what I was wondering.
What's wrong with Banaras?

372
00:29:57,416 --> 00:29:59,499
Even the delivery guys
are flirting with girls.

373
00:29:59,708 --> 00:30:02,832
I felt that I have seen you somewhere.

374
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,207
How is the wrist?

375
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:07,999
This one.

376
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:11,874
- Okay. See you.
- When?

377
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:14,540
Soon. Bye.

378
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:38,624
From a small school to JNU.

379
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:40,415
How did you get there?

380
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,374
Have you stopped eating
Gol Gappas(snacks)?

381
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:46,582
This is my friend. Rashmi.

382
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:48,124
Rashmi, this is...

383
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:50,249
Myself Shankar. Kundan Shankar.

384
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:52,749
- Are the Gol Gappas good?
- They are excellent.

385
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:58,624
- Zoya, how are we going to go?
- Where?

386
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,957
We have to elope, right?

387
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,540
Why are we going to elope?

388
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:10,374
Okay. So I'll convert into a Muslim.

389
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,540
Why would you convert into a Muslim?

390
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:15,499
Then how will we get married?

391
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,582
Whose marriage?

392
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:18,874
Yours and mine.

393
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:20,165
Hold on, brother.

394
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:22,290
Why would I and you get married?

395
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:25,749
- Because we love each other.
- Since when?

396
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:29,957
- Are five done?
- There is one left.

397
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,499
So give. And some more for madam.

398
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:34,540
One minute.

399
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:39,832
- What were you saying?
- Talk decently.

400
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:44,624
Okay. Let's make this a little decent.

401
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:46,499
When did we fall in love?

402
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:47,999
Give this to me.

403
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:49,082
What do you mean when
did we fall in love?

404
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:50,624
We have been in love
since the last 8 years.

405
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,828
In your dreams, Kundan.
There is nothing of that sort.

406
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:54,154
I was in the 9th grade back then.

407
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:57,040
Yes. As if I was pursuing law.

408
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:58,749
I was also in the 10th grade.

409
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:01,415
Kundan, we were immature then.

410
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,707
So now we are mature. Do it now.

411
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:07,415
You're mad, Kundan.
There is nothing of that sort.

412
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:09,790
Rashmi, let's go. Come on.

413
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:11,290
Who is he?

414
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:13,790
He was my friend when I was small.
He is mad.

415
00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:18,124
Listen you rickshaw driver,
don't take money from madam.

416
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,249
She is your sister-in-law.

417
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:20,499
Which one, brother?

418
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,582
The tall one who is angry.

419
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,290
What are you looking at?
Look in front.

420
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:27,598
You're mad.
There is nothing of that sort.

421
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:29,707
- Forget me.
- You forget me.

422
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:34,540
Forget me means goodbye.

423
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:37,999
The 10 year investment
has gone down the drain.

424
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:44,999
Murari, I have come at the right time.

425
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:46,540
Here's some sweet.

426
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:48,749
I heard that the priest's
son has become a widower.

427
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:50,207
Oh Lord!

428
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,980
What are you going to do now, mister?

429
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:54,540
Your sweetheart has lost her memory.

430
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:56,040
Hide.

431
00:32:56,416 --> 00:33:00,707
Murari, shut her up.
Or I'll beat her up.

432
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:02,582
Bindiya, stop deriving
pleasure from this.

433
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:04,290
The boy is serious.

434
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,415
Kundan, your Lord
cannot be such a liar.

435
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:09,165
I have been fasting on
Mondays for the last 15 years.

436
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,832
You are not marrying Zoya.

437
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:12,290
Do you want a beating?

438
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:14,082
I had told you.
I had told you. You'll get beaten up.

439
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:15,540
Okay. Okay. Leave her.

440
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:18,332
Don't push her down
and hit her on the back.

441
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:19,499
Don't throw her out.

442
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,124
- Don't throw her out the house.
- Rascal!

443
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,374
Threw her out of the house.

444
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,040
You moron! I curse you.

445
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:25,457
What happened, Bindiya?

446
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:27,790
Aunty, he is drunk in the afternoon.
That dog.

447
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,915
Banaras will rejoice
the day you marry me, Kundan.

448
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,999
I would rather marry
a witch than marry you.

449
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:35,457
Why you..

450
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:38,249
- You are the witch.
- Yes. Break the sandal as well.

451
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:49,124
- Kundan.
- Shut up.

452
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:50,915
- You monkey.
- You're the monkey.

453
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,415
Since you have a tail.

454
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:55,207
Zoya... Curses.

455
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,415
It's stuck.

456
00:33:57,916 --> 00:33:59,915
- Kundan, thank God I found you.
- Tell me.

457
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,880
I was looking for you
in the university as well.

458
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,499
We have a small function
at home tomorrow.

459
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:06,207
We are expecting around 50-60 guests.

460
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:08,582
Well, I have told Sunder
to do the decoration.

461
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:11,124
You also get some of
your boys to work on it.

462
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:12,665
Will come handy.

463
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:16,082
What's happening tomorrow night?

464
00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:18,707
Nothing as such.
You have come after so long.

465
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:21,624
And nothing has happened
in the house all this while.

466
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:23,540
Great. Not bad.

467
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:26,165
Kundan, what are you doing here?

468
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:31,040
- Well...
- He has come to wear bangles.

469
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:35,124
Listen. Why does she
laugh when she sees you?

470
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:38,290
Because she feels shy.

471
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:41,499
Now would she stare her
eyes out at her future husband?

472
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:44,582
A little shyness. A little shame.

473
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,332
This is the mark of a woman, Murari.

474
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:49,582
No. I think you'll
have a slit wrist again.

475
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,499
- Darn you.
- It's strange.

476
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,499
Get lost.

477
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:58,457
Everyone's looking so decent.

478
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:02,374
Pal, where is your madam?

479
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,290
And nor is her intelligent
friend to be seen.

480
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:10,457
No problem.
Both of them must be having a bath.

481
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:12,624
Shut up.

482
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:15,415
So Kundan.
Is everything under control?

483
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:17,665
- Yes, uncle.
- Handle everything.

484
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:19,332
A match is coming to see Zoya.

485
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:20,499
He is a doctor.

486
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:22,249
We'll get her married
to him if he likes her.

487
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:24,540
I will also be retiring in two years.

488
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:26,540
Where is Zoya?

489
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,499
What did father-in-law say?

490
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,499
Stop.

491
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:47,415
You are fooling me?

492
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:49,040
What nonsense, Kundan.

493
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:50,332
Let go of my hand. It hurts.

494
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:54,124
I am also hurting.
I have slit my wrist once.

495
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:55,999
Mind you, this time I'll slit yours.

496
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:57,332
What's wrong, Kundan?

497
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:59,749
- Why are you acting crazy?
- Okay.

498
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:03,332
Don't you know that a boy
is coming to see you this evening?

499
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:06,957
That is why your father
is having this celebration.

500
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:16,207
Mummy, is some boy coming
to see me this evening.

501
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:17,874
- Yes.
- Why didn't you tell me?

502
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:19,165
What should I have told you?

503
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,749
Your father has fixed everything.

504
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:22,790
Mummy, I am not a kid anymore
that you can do as you please.

505
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:24,124
I don't want to marry.

506
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:26,540
Zoya, don't create a scene.

507
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:29,374
Meet the boy and then let's see.

508
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:32,707
Look, he is only coming to see you.

509
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:34,681
You're not getting
married in the evening.

510
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,582
I have lots on my plate. Let me go.

511
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:44,457
- Listen.
- Sister-in-law. Zoya. Ms. Zoya.

512
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,374
Kundan will attend
the evening's party, right?

513
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,457
How can he not come?

514
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:52,040
The guru has given him
the job of serving sherbets.

515
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,790
Here, take all of it.

516
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:02,415
When will you people
stop acting silly?

517
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:06,207
Drink one at least first. Keep it. Go.

518
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:17,040
- Kundan, Zoya is calling you.
- Why?

519
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:19,874
Why don't you ask her?

520
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,374
I didn't know of all this, Kundan.

521
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:44,957
I don't want to marry that boy.

522
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,707
I see. So then?

523
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:53,790
Save me from all of this, Kundan?

524
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:56,290
Otherwise I'll slit
my wrist before you do.

525
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:59,374
Don't say so, Zoya. Wait and watch.

526
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:03,290
- Move.
- These days you are rarely seen.

527
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:05,832
- My marriage has been fixed.
- Here.

528
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:07,874
- What a shame.
- Get lost.

529
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:10,499
Aren't you ashamed to be a waiter?

530
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:12,082
Why should I be ashamed?

531
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:14,207
Your prince Charles is himself
serving sherbet to these rascals.

532
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:15,874
Oh God! Why?

533
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,707
What do you mean why?
It's sister-in-law's party.

534
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:20,832
She is your sister-in-law. And me?

535
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:22,749
You are also sister-in-law.

536
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,749
- And her?
- She's sister-in-law too.

537
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:28,082
As if your Kundan is a superstar..

538
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:31,082
That every girl would marry him.

539
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:34,207
Isn't he? Turn around.

540
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:09,165
"Someone's come before me.
And my heart's pounding."

541
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:13,749
"Just a glimpse of
hers has driven me crazy."

542
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,957
"Someone's come before me.
And my heart's pounding."

543
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:23,415
"Just a glimpse of
hers has driven me crazy."

544
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:28,249
"She will chat and meet me also."

545
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,915
"She'll be friends
with me sooner or later."

546
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:37,790
"Someone's come before me.
And my heart's pounding."

547
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:42,790
"Just a glimpse of
hers has driven me crazy."

548
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:53,040
Ordinary boys of lose their
love to a doctor or a engineer.

549
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,707
Don't be disheartened.

550
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:59,915
Murari, this is Banaras.

551
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:04,874
And if the ordinary boy loses
here as well, then he'll never win.

552
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:06,582
Is that so?

553
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:11,707
Mother. Please tell me.
Zoya will die, right?

554
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:18,457
Kundan will marry me, right?

555
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:22,540
Bindiya.

556
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:29,332
I will not do anything for you.
Spare me.

557
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:30,874
Listen, Bindiya.

558
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:33,957
You act so sweet
when you need a favor.

559
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:35,457
Otherwise you keep abusing me.

560
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:37,124
You're getting mad for no reason.

561
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,582
Aren't you my friend?

562
00:40:40,666 --> 00:40:42,624
Wait. Let me see. Hold on.

563
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:45,957
Mother, she should
do things for us, right?

564
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:48,040
- Look, she's saying yes. See.
- What do you want from me?

565
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:50,165
- Come here.
- Tell her the idea.

566
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:57,249
Yuck. Gross. Not at all.

567
00:40:57,333 --> 00:41:00,040
Bindiya, try to understand.

568
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,790
- I'm not doing anything for that wretch.
- Murari!

569
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:03,115
- Not at all.
- Murari, come on.

570
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:05,874
What's the matter?
Why are you shouting?

571
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:12,540
- Catch her.
- I'll never do it.

572
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:30,624
"Banarasi guy. Banarasi guy."

573
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:38,082
"Banarasi guy."

574
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,415
"ls there is a mess
up or are things messed up?"

575
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:46,165
"Banarasi guy. Banarasi guy."

576
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:49,457
"Are we fighting together? Or are
we fighting because we are together."

577
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:57,541
"Banarasi guy. Banarasi guy."

578
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:07,374
"Banarasi guy."

579
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:16,250
"Trickery is in the blood
of every man and woman here."

580
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:28,957
"But they are innocent at heart."

581
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:33,707
"They spend their lives
at the banks of Ganga."

582
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:40,832
"Residents of the bank."

583
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:49,250
"But Banarasi people have
an attitude all their own."

584
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:30,999
"ls there is a mess
up or are things messed up."

585
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:36,665
"Are we fighting together? Or are
we fighting because we are together."

586
00:43:37,708 --> 00:43:45,708
"They are capable of anything
when it comes to them."

587
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:58,707
"They chomp on some betel nut leaf.."

588
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:03,499
"..and walk around proudly."

589
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:09,415
"Proud Banarasi."

590
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:11,249
No. This is not possible.

591
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:13,707
I...I mean we're over
and done with this.

592
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:16,332
That's it. Okay. Yes.

593
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:24,583
"Proud Banarasi."

594
00:44:30,416 --> 00:44:37,582
"ls there is a mess
up or are things messed up?"

595
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:45,457
"Are we fighting together? Or are
we fighting because we are together."

596
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:54,083
"Banarasi guy. Banarasi guy."

597
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:03,207
Great. Now that you
don't need me anymore..

598
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:04,915
You even don't recognize me.

599
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,124
I do. Of course.

600
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:09,371
Since I got you of this pickle,
won't I get a reward?

601
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:11,374
Absolutely. Tell me. What do you want?

602
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:14,832
Marry me, Zoya.

603
00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:19,499
Are you mad? No. Never.

604
00:45:21,416 --> 00:45:24,415
Okay. Look,
I bought this scooter for you.

605
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,790
But you never sat on it.

606
00:45:25,958 --> 00:45:27,624
You'll have to be my pillion.

607
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:29,207
You will have to hold me by my waist.

608
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:30,457
Not the stepney.

609
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:32,915
When I put on the breaks,
you'll have to fall on me.

610
00:45:33,083 --> 00:45:34,624
You will have to
laugh at things I say.

611
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:36,707
You will have to sing with me.

612
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,832
You can do this at least, right?

613
00:45:38,958 --> 00:45:41,749
At least let me feel it.
So be it if not as my girlfriend.

614
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:24,415
That day for the first
time I saw you so upset.

615
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,707
I was so scared.

616
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,457
Yes, I stepped over the line.

617
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:30,874
Okay, I swear.
I'll never ever get mad at you again.

618
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:33,165
Okay. I have something to say.

619
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,540
Go ahead.

620
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:38,790
Thank you. You saved my life.

621
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,499
I would've been dead otherwise.

622
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:41,957
Me too.

623
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:45,915
Come what may.
I would've never married that boy.

624
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:48,040
I love someone else.

625
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:51,999
I know. But you've never said it.

626
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:54,832
I am telling now. There is a boy.

627
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:57,374
He studies with me in Delhi JNU.

628
00:46:57,708 --> 00:47:00,915
I'll give up my life
if I don't marry him.

629
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:03,332
I love him a lot.

630
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:08,249
'Three years in Aligarh
had left me really weak, Kundan.'

631
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:11,082
'My confidence was
at an all time low.'

632
00:47:11,291 --> 00:47:14,124
'Leave the house meekly.
And come back meekly.'

633
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:17,582
'Every girl was trained
to be the ideal wife.'

634
00:47:17,916 --> 00:47:20,290
'Aunt was running a coaching
institute and not a house.'

635
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:22,957
'l was good at studies.
So teachers told..'

636
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:25,499
'..me that I should study in Delhi.'

637
00:47:25,583 --> 00:47:26,374
Vote for Aisha. Vote for Aisha.

638
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:27,207
'So, after a lot of struggle..'

639
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:28,499
'..l came to JNU,
after completing my 12th.'

640
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:30,665
'l had to repeat 9th again..'

641
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,790
'..due to which,
there was a gap year.'

642
00:47:33,458 --> 00:47:35,249
'l was having trouble
getting admission.'

643
00:47:35,416 --> 00:47:37,874
'l had adequate marks,
but couldn't get admission.'

644
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:39,832
'When I arrived at JNU,
it was election time.'

645
00:47:39,916 --> 00:47:40,999
Parveen, go from here. Wait there.

646
00:47:41,083 --> 00:47:43,165
- I wish to see Mr. Anand.
- I had asked you to do that.

647
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:44,082
Yes.

648
00:47:44,166 --> 00:47:46,124
Look, my marks are up to the mark.
But I am not getting admission.

649
00:47:46,208 --> 00:47:48,332
- Why?
- Because I took a year's break.

650
00:47:48,416 --> 00:47:50,915
Do this. Be there outside
VC's office tomorrow at 11.

651
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:52,446
- Tomorrow at 11.
- Okay. Please.

652
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,915
Did you call him or not?

653
00:47:59,791 --> 00:48:01,915
'That day I saw him
for the first time.'

654
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:05,624
'An ordinary guy in a pant and shirt.'

655
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:09,124
'He had innocence in his eyes.
But he was fearless.'

656
00:48:09,541 --> 00:48:11,165
'He came across like a born leader.'

657
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:13,707
'When I saw him
I felt something which..'

658
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:16,207
'..l had never felt in 21-22 years.'

659
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:19,249
'During the conversation,
he lost his cool a number of times.'

660
00:48:19,583 --> 00:48:21,707
'He banged on the table.
Threw things around.'

661
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:24,163
'But he never raised his voice.
Nor did he threaten.'

662
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:25,874
- And nor was he disrespectful.
- I'm talking to you.

663
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:27,915
- And the VC had to relent.
- Calm down.

664
00:48:28,291 --> 00:48:29,624
'And they got up,
and left just quietly.'

665
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:31,374
He wasn't as tough as he looked.

666
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:33,499
He readily agreed to all our demands.

667
00:48:33,875 --> 00:48:35,207
- Excuse me.
- Listen, come here.

668
00:48:35,416 --> 00:48:37,957
- Thank you.
- Aunty, that's great.

669
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:40,374
Could've said that with a smile.

670
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,415
'That was my first meeting with him.'

671
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:46,952
'After that, I saw on the
day of the election results.'

672
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:49,165
Catch. Stop there.

673
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:51,540
I said stop.

674
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,082
Catch him.

675
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:56,374
Catch him from that side.

676
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:01,207
Hi!

677
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:05,291
We won!

678
00:49:13,416 --> 00:49:15,540
So, we can stop running now.

679
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:17,624
Uncle, 3 cups of tea.

680
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:20,957
You can drink with
the President today.

681
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,624
Enjoy.

682
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:24,790
Consider that,
a farmer has four children.

683
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,874
And, there's a bowl of
porridge prepared in his home.

684
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:31,957
But, I say why not
make two bowls of porridge?

685
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:37,915
They'll say "We've material
enough forjust one".

686
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:41,499
I believe, the rest of
it is at the minister's home.

687
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:43,478
There's one thing I would like to say.

688
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:46,665
When the poor won't
have anything to eat..

689
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,457
They'll start eating the rich.

690
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:52,831
We didn't get our salaries.

691
00:49:52,833 --> 00:49:55,332
We didn't get our bonus,
it's been six months.

692
00:49:55,416 --> 00:49:56,832
How will we make a living?

693
00:49:56,916 --> 00:49:58,517
Everything will be resolved,
don't worry.

694
00:49:58,708 --> 00:50:01,832
War. War. American war.

695
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:05,124
American war.

696
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:07,457
America...

697
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:09,207
All of you sing really well.

698
00:50:09,458 --> 00:50:12,082
You should quit social
work and start a band.

699
00:50:12,291 --> 00:50:14,171
And madam,
you're so beautiful that you should..

700
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,665
Quit college and become an actress.

701
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,165
No. Don't say that.

702
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:19,999
Ever since this girl
has come to the university..

703
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:21,624
It seems more likeable, right?

704
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:23,874
You are right.

705
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:28,665
Escapism is the easiest
thing in this world.

706
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:36,915
I am dying to see Disneyland
and statue of liberty.

707
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:40,790
Choose between coca cola and pepsi.

708
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:44,957
I heard your speech at the seminar.

709
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:48,165
Do you actually think that
everyone in this world is equal?

710
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:52,040
I mean in a country like India
can you seriously overlook caste..

711
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:54,540
Culture, creed, community,
social and economic position..

712
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:57,082
Of every individual
and speak about equality.

713
00:50:57,166 --> 00:50:59,165
But I seriously think you
are over-romanticizing a situation..

714
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:01,290
Which needs a much
more logical approach.

715
00:51:05,666 --> 00:51:07,374
- What is your name?
- Zoya.

716
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:10,499
Zoya.

717
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:20,749
Even If I was a nobody,
you would still be wincing like this.

718
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,707
Every man in this
country is different.

719
00:51:24,041 --> 00:51:28,915
On caste,
creed, class... blah... blah...

720
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:32,790
This is the fact.

721
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:35,249
And I don't fight for facts, madam.

722
00:51:36,666 --> 00:51:38,582
I fight for what's right.

723
00:51:39,791 --> 00:51:41,540
- Sorry.
- Go to hell.

724
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:45,995
'This was happening to
me for the first time, Kundan.'

725
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,749
'Right from Banaras
to Aligarh to Delhi..'

726
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:51,790
'..this was the first man
who had treated me like that.'

727
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:55,874
'For him, I was like anyone else.'

728
00:51:56,208 --> 00:51:58,999
'Actually he proved what he said.'

729
00:52:32,166 --> 00:52:35,124
- I get scared in the examination hall.
- What else can happen?

730
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:36,582
How were the exams?

731
00:52:37,416 --> 00:52:39,499
Madam, I had apologized to you.

732
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:41,957
What will you get by failing me?

733
00:52:42,708 --> 00:52:46,540
Equality. You had chits to cheat.

734
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,165
The rest didn't.

735
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,790
Either come prepared next time..

736
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:52,156
Or distribute the chits
in the entire examination hall.

737
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:54,999
This is a fact and also justified.

738
00:52:56,375 --> 00:52:59,582
- Now have I proved my point?
- No.

739
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,790
I haven't kissed anybody
else in this college.

740
00:53:05,875 --> 00:53:07,915
This proves that you are privileged.

741
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:11,499
This proves that not everyone
in this world is equal.

742
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:18,207
It was like I had regained
my lost courage, Kundan.

743
00:53:18,708 --> 00:53:20,999
This was college. A new world.

744
00:53:21,083 --> 00:53:23,082
New people. New courage.

745
00:53:23,458 --> 00:53:24,290
And, new love!

746
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:29,332
“I'm only for you, I'm your world."

747
00:53:29,875 --> 00:53:34,290
"You're so sweet, while I'm bitter."

748
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:41,165
“I'm all yours, I'm your world."

749
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:50,665
"The color red's so pure."

750
00:53:50,958 --> 00:53:56,332
“It's pure, it's filled with life.'

751
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,540
"You dwell in my heart now."

752
00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:02,540
“I've found my beloved."

753
00:54:02,625 --> 00:54:07,082
"Let no one cast an evil eye on you."

754
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,374
"Curses to anyone who does."

755
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:18,207
"My heart now belongs to you."

756
00:54:18,291 --> 00:54:26,291
"Let no one cast an evil eye on you."

757
00:54:32,541 --> 00:54:37,749
“I'm only for you, I'm your world."

758
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:42,707
"You're so sweet, while I'm bitter."

759
00:54:42,916 --> 00:54:46,165
“I'm all yours, I'm your world."

760
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:51,749
“I'm all yours."

761
00:55:00,416 --> 00:55:01,749
Kundan!

762
00:55:05,416 --> 00:55:06,915
What are you doing, Kundan?

763
00:55:19,541 --> 00:55:22,540
Kundan. Kundan.

764
00:55:38,666 --> 00:55:40,582
There will be no
electricity for three days.

765
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:42,540
Yeah, that's common with us too.

766
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:45,790
What happened? How did you get wet?

767
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:47,665
Did someone throw water on you?

768
00:55:47,875 --> 00:55:51,290
There's a boy here to see you.
Go inside and change.

769
00:55:51,625 --> 00:55:53,749
I'm serving food, get changed.

770
00:55:56,958 --> 00:55:58,124
You just sat down.

771
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:02,957
Get married. That's all we want.

772
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:06,040
- I don't want to.
- What do you mean you don't want to?

773
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:08,290
He was such a nice, well educated boy.

774
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,374
Well educated? They are
freaking half educated people.

775
00:56:11,875 --> 00:56:14,415
- What did you say?
- What do you want, mother?

776
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,999
Either you shouldn't
have sent me out of town..

777
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:17,249
Or given me such good education.

778
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:18,915
And since you have done so much..

779
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,601
The boy should
be of my choice, right?

780
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:24,999
Or should I marry an
uncouth boy like Kundan?

781
00:56:31,208 --> 00:56:33,790
This boy... was like Kundan?

782
00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:35,332
He has a big house. Big cars.

783
00:56:35,416 --> 00:56:36,999
What else does one need?

784
00:56:41,625 --> 00:56:43,832
I want a boy like me.

785
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:46,749
What do you mean by that?

786
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,707
- I love someone else.
- What?

787
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:06,290
- You call this cleaning? Sweep here.
- Yes.

788
00:57:06,375 --> 00:57:09,124
Murari, what's wrong with Kundan?
He is not talking to anyone.

789
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,249
Forget him.
Ask what is wrong the scooter.

790
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:13,957
He drove my brand new
scooter into the Ganges.

791
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:15,624
- I just took it to the mechanic.
- Don't know what happened?

792
00:57:15,708 --> 00:57:17,665
He says the entire
engine needs overhauling.

793
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,832
Kundan. What have you done!

794
00:57:22,125 --> 00:57:25,540
Kundan. Get up. Get up.

795
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:28,915
Get up.

796
00:57:32,041 --> 00:57:33,957
You think love is a joke?

797
00:57:34,041 --> 00:57:35,957
You slit your wrist
as when you feel like.

798
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,750
This seems more like UPSC
examination and not love.

799
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:40,082
You just can't pass it.

800
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:42,040
Zoya loves someone else.

801
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:45,540
To hell with your love.
To hell with Zoya.

802
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:47,624
Don't you cry like a sissy who has
lost his love in front of me.

803
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:49,707
And don't go to sleep.

804
00:57:50,041 --> 00:57:52,249
"Beloved. My beloved."

805
00:57:52,333 --> 00:57:54,790
Tell me what the doctors said,

806
00:57:54,875 --> 00:57:57,275
Aunt, what do I know? I was
busy settling things with Ramesh.

807
00:57:57,291 --> 00:57:59,124
This is not the solution.

808
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:01,749
Listen, Mr.
Psychiatrist, are you done?

809
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:03,374
So leave.

810
00:58:03,666 --> 00:58:05,290
Don't use your brains too much.

811
00:58:06,291 --> 00:58:07,999
- Eat it.
- He's calling it suicide.

812
00:58:08,041 --> 00:58:10,415
As he said... He just... crazy.

813
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,624
He won't say that.

814
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:17,332
I had been to your house.

815
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,790
From there I came to
know that you are here.

816
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,332
Yes. You will find him here
if you don't find him at home.

817
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:26,430
He is in the hospital
if he is not at home.

818
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:29,332
- Murari.
- I want to talk to you.

819
00:58:32,916 --> 00:58:34,499
In private.

820
00:58:38,666 --> 00:58:40,707
Come, aunt. Let's go meet the doctor.

821
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,280
Ask him what you were asking me.

822
00:58:42,291 --> 00:58:44,332
Bindiya, come on. Come on.

823
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,874
Come with me.

824
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:51,249
Apples are 180 rupees a kilo.

825
00:58:51,458 --> 00:58:53,957
You get vitamins from me.
But you love them.

826
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:55,999
What a stubborn boy!

827
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:01,915
What a loser!

828
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:04,374
Explain to your friend.
She is a curse to us.

829
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:05,832
Keep quiet.

830
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:15,415
Zoya tried your number many times.

831
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,124
She said that she wants to meet you.

832
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:47,290
Zoya.

833
00:59:48,125 --> 00:59:52,290
I will give up my life
if these people force me, Kundan.

834
00:59:55,708 --> 00:59:58,874
- How did this happen?
- Nothing.

835
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,665
You slit your wrist again?

836
01:00:01,708 --> 01:00:03,707
How stupid can one be?

837
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:06,207
There is a limit to tolerance.

838
01:00:06,833 --> 01:00:08,832
Is this all you know to do?

839
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:11,374
I made a mistake when I was small.

840
01:00:11,583 --> 01:00:14,290
So are you going to
ruin my life for that?

841
01:00:15,708 --> 01:00:17,040
Come on.

842
01:00:17,666 --> 01:00:21,040
You want to marry, right?
This is all you want, right?

843
01:00:21,291 --> 01:00:23,124
Let the world go to hell.

844
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:26,124
What happened? Come on.

845
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,290
Come on.

846
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:47,207
Don't you understand, Kundan?

847
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:51,582
You are a Hindu and I am Muslim.

848
01:00:51,875 --> 01:00:53,415
We are poles apart.

849
01:00:53,625 --> 01:00:56,124
You come to deliver
gas cylinder to our house.

850
01:00:56,458 --> 01:00:59,749
Father likes you.
So he gives the car for servicing.

851
01:01:00,291 --> 01:01:02,040
You carry mother's bag of grocery.

852
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:03,624
You get flour for us.

853
01:01:03,791 --> 01:01:08,290
This doesn't mean they'll
get their daughter married to you.

854
01:01:08,625 --> 01:01:11,290
I had imagined that you
would help me if not anyone else.

855
01:01:11,875 --> 01:01:14,249
But you turned out
to be my biggest enemy.

856
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:35,582
I have shed blood. You shed tears.

857
01:01:36,041 --> 01:01:39,332
This seems more like a
violent story than a love story.

858
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:45,457
Go. Go home. Have food. Go to sleep.

859
01:01:45,875 --> 01:01:49,999
I'll come up with something. Go. Go.

860
01:01:54,958 --> 01:01:56,374
What is your boyfriend's name?

861
01:01:56,541 --> 01:01:58,374
Should I call him Amitabh Bachchan?

862
01:02:00,166 --> 01:02:02,332
Akram. Akram Zaidi.

863
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:23,957
Kundan! At this hour?

864
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:32,541
Sir, the Hindu boy Zoya fell
in love with 8 years ago was me.

865
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:53,624
Because of whom you
distanced Zoya from yourself.

866
01:02:53,958 --> 01:02:55,374
It was me, sir.

867
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:03,415
I kept coming to your house
so that I get close to you.

868
01:03:03,625 --> 01:03:05,624
I kept working for you
like a servant hoping you would..

869
01:03:05,708 --> 01:03:07,124
Consider me family.

870
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:14,707
Only to elope with Zoya
when she returns one day.

871
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:16,457
What happened, Mr. Haider?

872
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,790
But your daughter
loves you a lot, sir.

873
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:22,457
She cares a great
deal about your honor.

874
01:03:22,958 --> 01:03:25,249
She had forgotten me 8 years ago.

875
01:03:26,416 --> 01:03:28,707
But the boy she loves so much.

876
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:32,415
She wants to marry
him with your consent only.

877
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:34,582
She could've eloped, sir.

878
01:03:34,666 --> 01:03:36,249
And no one could've done a thing.

879
01:03:37,166 --> 01:03:39,540
You wouldn't have found
anyone's collar to grab.

880
01:03:40,625 --> 01:03:42,290
And what problem do you have?

881
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:45,790
He is a Muslim boy from a good family.

882
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,665
He is well educated.
Not an uncouth like me.

883
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:00,790
What happened, pal?

884
01:04:00,875 --> 01:04:03,790
I am jacked up.
Now do you want to help me?

885
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:06,332
Get lost, moron.

886
01:04:06,416 --> 01:04:09,207
- One by one.
- Yes, I am giving. Hold on.

887
01:04:09,375 --> 01:04:11,749
Now I won't give. Back up. Back up.

888
01:04:16,375 --> 01:04:18,207
She is here. Go.

889
01:04:19,416 --> 01:04:23,290
I think this has been
going for a bit too long.

890
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,207
I think you should end it.

891
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:26,790
Yes, I'm giving. Don't get desperate.

892
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,499
No. I am not. I've run out of it.

893
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:34,582
If you couldn't find sweets
you could've ordered something else.

894
01:04:35,458 --> 01:04:37,290
Thank you. Thank you so much.

895
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,665
Otherwise papa would've
never understood.

896
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,249
You made a fool out of me, Zoya.

897
01:04:51,166 --> 01:04:52,624
What do you think, Zoya?

898
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:56,415
You are some damsel.

899
01:04:57,416 --> 01:05:00,165
Loving you was my talent, Zoya.

900
01:05:00,583 --> 01:05:02,665
You don't deserve any credit for it.

901
01:05:04,125 --> 01:05:06,040
Even if it had been
anyone else instead of you..

902
01:05:06,166 --> 01:05:08,124
I would've loved herjust as much.

903
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,707
What do you think, Zoya?

904
01:05:12,291 --> 01:05:15,165
You are the only one in
the whole of Banaras for Kundan?

905
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:24,999
I will marry the day you marry.
Be it with a witch.

906
01:05:25,416 --> 01:05:27,499
I'll marry on that very day.
As far as your marriage goes..

907
01:05:27,583 --> 01:05:29,540
And I will do
everything I can in it.

908
01:05:30,916 --> 01:05:32,249
I would rather die.

909
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:36,540
But, I'll never utter your name again..

910
01:05:39,125 --> 01:05:40,665
Or, I'm a deadman.

911
01:05:54,208 --> 01:05:56,957
Look, forcing women is a crime.

912
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,624
Why don't you listen to me.

913
01:05:58,708 --> 01:06:01,124
Her father's a police officer,
we'll be jailed.

914
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:04,124
Don't create a scene.
You'll have to get a nose ring.

915
01:06:04,208 --> 01:06:06,874
- This crazy girl's troubling me.
- Mummy.

916
01:06:11,416 --> 01:06:12,665
- Bindiya.
- What is it?

917
01:06:14,208 --> 01:06:16,749
You were really fond
of marrying me, right?

918
01:06:17,791 --> 01:06:21,749
Tell your father. To call
the confectioner and the priest.

919
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,540
You're getting married to me.

920
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:26,457
On the 21st.

921
01:07:05,208 --> 01:07:09,582
"Tell me.
Tell me. What is this, my friend?"

922
01:07:09,666 --> 01:07:13,999
"Tell me.
Tell me. What is this mystery?"

923
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:18,749
"Tell me.
Tell me. What is this, my friend?"

924
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:23,040
"Tell me.
Tell me. What is this mystery?"

925
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:31,250
"What is this mystery?
Am I the mystery?"

926
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:08,749
"Everything changes in a flash."

927
01:08:08,916 --> 01:08:12,999
“I have life long bond with her."

928
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,457
"At times it seems populated.
And at times deserted."

929
01:08:18,541 --> 01:08:26,541
"There can be no marriage
without friends."

930
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:56,415
"He can plunge me into darkness."

931
01:08:56,500 --> 01:09:00,957
"Or light up my life."

932
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,665
"He can plunge me into darkness."

933
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:10,207
"Or light up my life."

934
01:09:10,916 --> 01:09:15,332
“I cherish weird dreams."

935
01:09:15,416 --> 01:09:23,416
"There is no season
without your beloved."

936
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:36,750
"He makes torments
me when he is with me."

937
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:42,249
"He is nowhere to be seen
even though he is near me."

938
01:09:42,375 --> 01:09:46,749
"When he is near me, he jinxes me."

939
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:54,958
"My desires always stay with him."

940
01:09:56,416 --> 01:10:00,874
“I do everything in my power for him."

941
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:09,000
"And there are no
friends without mates."

942
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,624
What happened, pal?

943
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:35,874
A lover doesn't get petrified
when his love is about to get married.

944
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,457
He gets petrified when
he is about to get married.

945
01:10:40,208 --> 01:10:43,249
Let him cry. It is his doing.

946
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:56,374
Enough. Stop. Stop.

947
01:10:58,416 --> 01:11:01,874
Why is this happening with me, Murari?

948
01:11:05,291 --> 01:11:07,749
One minute. One minute, Kundan.

949
01:11:10,583 --> 01:11:11,999
What the..

950
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:16,124
- Yes, I am fine.
- Take a look.

951
01:11:28,916 --> 01:11:31,999
Kundan. Kundan, you are mad.
Listen to me.

952
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:34,290
Kundan, where are you going?

953
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:36,415
Kundan, where are you going?
Are you mad?

954
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:58,290
I won't be able to eat all that.

955
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:01,999
Kundan. What happened?

956
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:06,982
Complete it.

957
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:20,040
Kundan, what happened?

958
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:31,207
I learnt at least that in your love.

959
01:12:32,541 --> 01:12:34,290
You should've taught him something.

960
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,499
What's happening?

961
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:43,165
What happened?

962
01:12:54,625 --> 01:12:55,915
He is Hindu.

963
01:13:12,416 --> 01:13:14,290
'And with that incident..'

964
01:13:14,375 --> 01:13:15,665
'..this beautiful
chapter came to an end.'

965
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:16,790
'It was time to wage war.'

966
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:19,749
'All hail Lord Ram.'

967
01:13:25,166 --> 01:13:33,166
"No one's a kin.."

968
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:41,624
Kundan, what are you doing?

969
01:13:41,958 --> 01:13:43,457
Zoya has slit her wrist.

970
01:13:43,541 --> 01:13:44,790
There was blood
all over the house.

971
01:13:44,875 --> 01:13:46,790
She's been taken to a hospital.
Let's go.

972
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,957
- Which hospital has she been taken too?
- The one at Hanuman Fatak.

973
01:13:51,041 --> 01:13:51,915
- And, the boy Akram?
- Hey.

974
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,999
He was badly beaten up.
They smashed his head.

975
01:13:54,041 --> 01:13:56,082
And, these boys
dumped him somewhere.

976
01:13:57,041 --> 01:13:59,415
Don't try to act smart with us.

977
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:01,165
It wasn't me.

978
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,040
It was Nawaz and Guddu.

979
01:14:03,416 --> 01:14:05,374
I left from the
Kent Railway Station.

980
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:06,790
They were still beating him up.

981
01:14:08,458 --> 01:14:09,415
Stay in your senses.

982
01:14:12,375 --> 01:14:13,332
Kundan!

983
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,040
He was my brother.

984
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:26,249
- Akram!
- Akram!

985
01:14:26,333 --> 01:14:27,499
Jasjeet!

986
01:14:29,458 --> 01:14:30,957
- Jasjeet!
- Jasjeet!

987
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:34,082
Murari.. Jasjeet!

988
01:14:34,166 --> 01:14:35,165
Jasjeet!

989
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:38,040
Oh no!

990
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:41,499
Jasjeet!

991
01:14:42,583 --> 01:14:44,503
- Jasjeet! Jasjeet!
- They really thrashed me up.

992
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,499
- Lift him up.
- Jasjeet.

993
01:15:00,833 --> 01:15:01,665
Doctor!

994
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:03,874
He's fine now.

995
01:15:08,666 --> 01:15:09,540
I'll be back soon.

996
01:15:14,041 --> 01:15:15,290
She's better now.

997
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,165
But, she's lost lot of blood.

998
01:15:26,708 --> 01:15:28,348
Weren't you getting
married today as well?

999
01:15:31,208 --> 01:15:35,249
Oh no! Darn it!

1000
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:46,665
You go alone, Pal.

1001
01:15:47,208 --> 01:15:48,582
I cannot face this.

1002
01:15:58,458 --> 01:15:59,415
He's here.

1003
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:03,457
- The bridegroom came.
- Okay.

1004
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:28,665
He's here.

1005
01:16:39,541 --> 01:16:42,332
Why did you do such a terrible
thing with this girl?

1006
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:45,290
Move.

1007
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:51,415
Get out of this house.
Don't ever show me your face again.

1008
01:17:54,333 --> 01:17:56,082
I knew it all the time.

1009
01:17:58,416 --> 01:18:00,290
But, it was too late.

1010
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:05,624
Wouldn't have made a difference.

1011
01:18:07,458 --> 01:18:11,124
The Delhi government
couldn't lay a finger on me.

1012
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:17,457
But, a girl got me messed up.

1013
01:18:19,625 --> 01:18:21,374
Same with me.

1014
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:27,624
Like a fool, I did as she said.

1015
01:18:30,333 --> 01:18:33,957
You should never pay
heed to a girl's suggestions.

1016
01:18:36,125 --> 01:18:38,290
There's lot of
work I still got to do.

1017
01:18:39,416 --> 01:18:40,957
If I don't get well soon..

1018
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:43,957
Who's going to raise
his voice in the Parliament.

1019
01:18:44,791 --> 01:18:49,332
What line had we thought
of telling to this champ here?

1020
01:18:49,416 --> 01:18:50,999
- What was it?
- My, my, your principals..

1021
01:18:51,041 --> 01:18:53,915
- My, my. Your principals.
- These ideologies.

1022
01:18:54,125 --> 01:18:55,790
These ideologies.

1023
01:18:55,875 --> 01:18:57,790
You can't get one time meal..

1024
01:18:59,041 --> 01:19:02,124
These things can't
get you even one time meal.

1025
01:19:03,208 --> 01:19:07,332
And the rallies you have on streets
and the slogans and all.

1026
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,540
This is not going
to be of any use. Got it?

1027
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:17,457
Join our party.
True happiness is in being in power.

1028
01:19:17,916 --> 01:19:19,624
You hail from Jalandhar, right?

1029
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:21,438
I'll get a ticket
from Jalandhar area.

1030
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:25,582
Anand, what had we
thought of replying to Mr. Gupta?

1031
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:27,207
First go and get
the sign of the man...

1032
01:19:27,291 --> 01:19:28,374
Yes.

1033
01:19:28,458 --> 01:19:31,624
First go and get the sign of
the man whom you have been fooling..

1034
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,165
For the last 60 years.

1035
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:38,249
And then I'm ready to sign
any paper you give me, Mr. Gupta.

1036
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:41,505
Why will we fight
the elections from Jalandhar..

1037
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,499
When we can win from Delhi.

1038
01:19:43,916 --> 01:19:45,915
We'll fight.
And create our own party.

1039
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:47,457
Thank you for the offer, sir.

1040
01:19:51,916 --> 01:19:53,332
And sir, you are right.

1041
01:19:53,541 --> 01:19:54,957
Real happiness
is in being in power.

1042
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:57,415
The rest is rubbish.

1043
01:19:59,666 --> 01:20:01,332
- Did you saw that?
- Yes.

1044
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:10,415
"We're boys of free will."

1045
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:14,874
"We can ride the winds as well."

1046
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:19,707
"The path of love,
is a difficult one."

1047
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:25,957
"Be brave... give
me your heart without a care."

1048
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:31,165
"Learn to be faithful from us."

1049
01:20:31,708 --> 01:20:35,957
"Get some fresh air from us."

1050
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,165
"The stories of the heart.
The days in our share."

1051
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:51,499
"Can only be
spent from the heart."

1052
01:20:51,583 --> 01:20:58,999
"Get rid of all the fears."

1053
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:07,958
"Forget the worries.
Destroy the fears."

1054
01:21:09,166 --> 01:21:11,707
"Sweetheart, come with me."

1055
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:15,624
"Come,
the world of dreams awaits you."

1056
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:23,708
"The one who is alive in the
true sense can conquer the world."

1057
01:21:24,458 --> 01:21:29,374
"He will breathe freely."

1058
01:21:29,458 --> 01:21:33,790
"Learn to be faithful from us."

1059
01:21:33,875 --> 01:21:38,124
"Get some fresh air from us."

1060
01:21:38,333 --> 01:21:42,915
"Learn to be faithful from us."

1061
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,832
"Get some fresh air from us."

1062
01:21:47,916 --> 01:21:52,665
"Join the path of truth."

1063
01:21:58,541 --> 01:22:00,665
- Let's go everyone, to the big house.
- How's everything? All okay?

1064
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:03,540
- Mr. Salim, how are you?
- Great.

1065
01:22:03,708 --> 01:22:04,708
You came here personally.

1066
01:22:04,833 --> 01:22:07,233
You've done such a thing
that we have to come time and again.

1067
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:08,374
Aunt?

1068
01:22:08,458 --> 01:22:10,040
Good to see you, Seema.
I'm coming back tomorrow.

1069
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:11,457
We've such immense pressure
from our seniors to arrest you.

1070
01:22:11,541 --> 01:22:13,290
We have been sent to arrest you.

1071
01:22:13,583 --> 01:22:15,582
- How is everyone at home?
- Great.

1072
01:22:15,666 --> 01:22:17,457
- Officer, you too are here.
- Yes.

1073
01:22:17,541 --> 01:22:19,040
Where are you going, sir?

1074
01:22:19,083 --> 01:22:20,374
Come. Let me show you the jail.

1075
01:22:20,458 --> 01:22:22,915
No. No. Good for you, sir.

1076
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:26,040
What can I do if I'm
destined to marry a criminal?

1077
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:28,499
Excuse me.

1078
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:31,915
What criminal, madam?

1079
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:33,832
I am about to be the CM.

1080
01:22:34,041 --> 01:22:37,040
And if lady luck shines on me,
then I'll be the PM some day.

1081
01:22:37,958 --> 01:22:39,079
This is the chance you have.

1082
01:22:39,208 --> 01:22:41,999
If you marry me,
your life will be risk free.

1083
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:45,040
Or carry on with your
street plays in Dariaganj.

1084
01:22:45,083 --> 01:22:47,957
I see. And who'll ask my parents?

1085
01:22:48,125 --> 01:22:51,790
Parents? If you say,
I can ask the entire nation.

1086
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:55,582
I will announce it
from Red Fort on 15th August.

1087
01:22:56,291 --> 01:22:59,374
Bye. Let's go, sir.

1088
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:03,290
Injustice won't be tolerated.
Injustice won't be tolerated.

1089
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:07,082
"Let's see if your
jail's can hold us."

1090
01:23:07,166 --> 01:23:11,124
"Let's see if you
really got the guts."

1091
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:14,999
"Let's see if your
jail's can hold us."

1092
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:22,707
After that, Zoya left for Beneras.

1093
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:26,040
She called few days ago.

1094
01:23:26,166 --> 01:23:27,540
Are you insane?

1095
01:23:27,708 --> 01:23:28,790
Who's going to put up this act?

1096
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:30,540
Just spare a week for me, please.

1097
01:23:30,625 --> 01:23:31,707
Everything will be fine.

1098
01:23:31,833 --> 01:23:34,707
Zoya, this is nonsense.
I've too much left to do.

1099
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:37,582
Everything was fine.

1100
01:23:38,291 --> 01:23:39,624
Everything under control.

1101
01:23:41,875 --> 01:23:42,790
And now...

1102
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,040
Everything's shattered.

1103
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,207
Father, this is Kundan.

1104
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,415
He saved brother.

1105
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:09,582
Otherwise, brother wouldn't
have made it alive..

1106
01:24:09,666 --> 01:24:10,874
From the accident.

1107
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:18,165
Thank you son,
you've been a big help.

1108
01:24:19,041 --> 01:24:21,082
But, we don't
understand a thing here,

1109
01:24:21,958 --> 01:24:23,540
We're taking him back to Punjab.

1110
01:24:23,833 --> 01:24:24,915
He's lost a lot of blood.

1111
01:24:25,041 --> 01:24:26,481
But, there's nothing to worry about.

1112
01:24:32,083 --> 01:24:33,290
I'll need a tempo.

1113
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:36,624
What's cooking in your mind now?

1114
01:24:37,333 --> 01:24:39,207
And, two train tickets to Punjab.

1115
01:24:39,666 --> 01:24:40,624
Tickets?

1116
01:24:40,916 --> 01:24:42,165
What for?

1117
01:24:43,958 --> 01:24:46,707
Elope! With Zoya.

1118
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:48,999
Tonight.

1119
01:24:49,666 --> 01:24:51,457
Have you lost it, Pal?

1120
01:24:51,666 --> 01:24:53,165
You think Zoya will come with you.

1121
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:54,957
I'll just take her to Jasjeet.

1122
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:57,790
You'll get yourself killed.
She'll never take a favor from you.

1123
01:24:57,875 --> 01:24:59,249
I don't have a choice.

1124
01:24:59,333 --> 01:25:01,165
Kundan, there's a limit to..

1125
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:13,457
Just do as I'm saying..

1126
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:06,499
Jasjeet's fine.

1127
01:26:07,541 --> 01:26:10,540
He's hurt, but fine.

1128
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,832
His parents took him back home.

1129
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:21,332
I made a big mistake.

1130
01:26:23,541 --> 01:26:24,999
But, I swear..

1131
01:26:25,541 --> 01:26:30,082
I'll take you to Jasjeet.

1132
01:26:33,416 --> 01:26:34,124
What?

1133
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:29,290
"The one you're searching for,
dwells in your heart."

1134
01:27:29,541 --> 01:27:34,582
"There's a sea inside you,
stop looking for droplets."

1135
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:39,874
"The one you're searching for,
dwells in your heart."

1136
01:27:40,083 --> 01:27:45,207
"There's a sea inside you,
stop looking for droplets."

1137
01:27:45,375 --> 01:27:53,375
"Clear all your doubts."

1138
01:27:55,958 --> 01:27:58,249
"Lift the veil."

1139
01:27:58,333 --> 01:28:03,415
"Beloved."

1140
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:11,500
"You will see your beloved."

1141
01:28:14,375 --> 01:28:19,540
"The one you're searching for,
dwells in your heart."

1142
01:28:19,625 --> 01:28:24,665
"There's a sea inside you,
stop looking for droplets."

1143
01:28:24,958 --> 01:28:32,832
"Clear all your doubts."

1144
01:28:32,916 --> 01:28:35,082
"Lift the veil."

1145
01:28:35,166 --> 01:28:43,166
"You will see your beloved."

1146
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:58,625
"No point in
seeing what others do."

1147
01:29:01,166 --> 01:29:09,166
"Try to see what the others can."

1148
01:29:11,916 --> 01:29:17,540
"You can't see
with the naked eye."

1149
01:29:17,625 --> 01:29:22,582
"Close your eyes,
and you can see it."

1150
01:29:22,666 --> 01:29:28,165
"You will see your beloved."

1151
01:30:17,958 --> 01:30:23,040
"You don't always
get what you want."

1152
01:30:23,125 --> 01:30:28,415
"My companion is only my shadow."

1153
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:34,124
"You robbed me of my heart."

1154
01:30:34,458 --> 01:30:39,290
"Yet you whisper softly."

1155
01:30:39,375 --> 01:30:47,375
"You will see your beloved."

1156
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:55,207
"The one you're searching for,
dwells in your heart."

1157
01:30:55,541 --> 01:31:00,707
"There's a sea inside you,
stop looking for droplets."

1158
01:31:00,791 --> 01:31:08,791
"Clear all your doubts."

1159
01:31:11,375 --> 01:31:13,624
"Lift the veil."

1160
01:31:13,708 --> 01:31:18,874
"Beloved."

1161
01:31:18,958 --> 01:31:24,207
"You will see your beloved."

1162
01:31:36,666 --> 01:31:37,749
Go away.

1163
01:31:42,041 --> 01:31:50,041
"You will see your beloved."

1164
01:31:52,958 --> 01:31:57,874
"The one you're searching for,
dwells in your heart."

1165
01:31:58,208 --> 01:32:03,457
"There's a sea inside you,
stop looking for droplets."

1166
01:32:37,416 --> 01:32:39,874
Bring it, dear. Baba will bless you.

1167
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:42,999
Hey. Priest. Leave.

1168
01:32:43,208 --> 01:32:44,874
Go on. Go.

1169
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,915
You know,
many of the sages here are cheats.

1170
01:32:54,375 --> 01:32:55,874
Castouts.

1171
01:32:56,250 --> 01:32:57,540
Bloody criminals.

1172
01:32:58,291 --> 01:32:59,665
Murderer, rapists.

1173
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:02,374
They just dawn the saffron color..

1174
01:33:02,625 --> 01:33:04,582
And mingle along
with the real ones.

1175
01:33:09,166 --> 01:33:10,790
Whom did you kill?

1176
01:33:14,875 --> 01:33:16,457
I can see it on your face.

1177
01:33:18,041 --> 01:33:25,207
No faith in this world
can pardon a murderer.

1178
01:33:27,958 --> 01:33:29,790
Go. Do something.

1179
01:33:32,041 --> 01:33:33,415
Don't know what?

1180
01:33:34,458 --> 01:33:40,040
But, you won't get salvation
at the banks of Ganges.

1181
01:33:51,833 --> 01:33:53,499
- Hello.
- Murari.

1182
01:33:53,583 --> 01:33:55,665
Where are you?

1183
01:33:56,125 --> 01:33:58,124
I've been thinking about you.

1184
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:02,290
- Is Zoya in Beneras?
- In Beneras? Is she?

1185
01:34:02,458 --> 01:34:04,249
That's exactly what
I'm asking. Is she?

1186
01:34:04,458 --> 01:34:05,874
Rascal, you eloped with her.

1187
01:34:05,958 --> 01:34:07,665
Do you know the chaos it led to?

1188
01:34:07,916 --> 01:34:09,237
What are you doing?
Where are you?

1189
01:34:09,291 --> 01:34:10,249
And, where's Zoya?

1190
01:34:18,208 --> 01:34:20,832
"Seeking him. Feeling him."

1191
01:34:20,916 --> 01:34:23,957
"Either its you, or its him."

1192
01:34:26,166 --> 01:34:28,707
"Seeking him. Feeling him."

1193
01:34:28,833 --> 01:34:31,707
"Either its you, or its him."

1194
01:34:34,041 --> 01:34:40,082
"Without him, everything's vain."

1195
01:34:42,083 --> 01:34:50,083
"You will see your beloved."

1196
01:34:59,583 --> 01:35:01,457
People look, stare at you.

1197
01:35:01,625 --> 01:35:05,582
Humiliate you with their stare.
Disrobe you.

1198
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:07,499
And say "We're just looking".

1199
01:35:09,916 --> 01:35:11,999
They whistle, sing songs..

1200
01:35:12,041 --> 01:35:16,165
And tell their friends about it,
show-off that they're men.

1201
01:35:17,125 --> 01:35:19,624
And say, "We were just looking,
it's not a crime".

1202
01:35:20,583 --> 01:35:28,583
"Are you alive?"

1203
01:35:32,791 --> 01:35:34,040
Is everyone here?

1204
01:35:34,125 --> 01:35:36,249
- Zoya, let's go.
- Yes, drive this vehicle.

1205
01:36:00,541 --> 01:36:03,457
- What's wrong?
- Just a second.

1206
01:36:05,375 --> 01:36:06,290
Hey!

1207
01:36:07,666 --> 01:36:09,040
What are you doing?

1208
01:36:10,041 --> 01:36:11,540
- Hey.
- Hey.

1209
01:36:11,958 --> 01:36:13,415
We had to wrestle the management..

1210
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:14,915
To install that pipe.

1211
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,499
Don't break it.

1212
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:19,915
Who are you? What're you doing?

1213
01:36:20,166 --> 01:36:21,957
And, why are you
climbing up the pipe?

1214
01:36:23,875 --> 01:36:26,540
I...am a thief.

1215
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:28,707
I was here to steal.

1216
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,290
Why don't we turn him in?

1217
01:36:31,375 --> 01:36:35,124
That will mean we believe
in this administration system.

1218
01:36:35,208 --> 01:36:37,082
I know,
it's a completely ruthless..

1219
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:38,915
And a politically
aggressive system.

1220
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,082
Correct.
And, we should be against it.

1221
01:36:41,166 --> 01:36:43,499
He's a victim
of this system as well.

1222
01:36:43,583 --> 01:36:45,582
Samosa (Fritters).

1223
01:36:46,583 --> 01:36:47,874
Two Samosas.

1224
01:36:49,166 --> 01:36:50,332
Samosa?

1225
01:36:51,250 --> 01:36:53,124
Chotu. Samosas.

1226
01:36:53,666 --> 01:36:54,790
Two.

1227
01:36:55,041 --> 01:36:57,624
So, we need to understand..

1228
01:36:57,833 --> 01:37:00,124
Why would anyone become a thief.

1229
01:37:00,208 --> 01:37:01,832
Why did you become one?

1230
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,499
Because... I'm poor.

1231
01:37:11,416 --> 01:37:13,332
Water..

1232
01:37:14,583 --> 01:37:16,457
Tea...

1233
01:37:17,958 --> 01:37:20,582
Poverty is a result
of over-population.

1234
01:37:21,125 --> 01:37:23,124
Don't simplify things.

1235
01:37:23,416 --> 01:37:26,499
Over-population is a
result of lack of education.

1236
01:37:26,583 --> 01:37:28,374
But, lower-classes
don't have resources..

1237
01:37:28,458 --> 01:37:29,332
To educate their children.

1238
01:37:29,416 --> 01:37:30,415
No, no. One minute.

1239
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:32,374
Even the educated
youth in this country..

1240
01:37:32,458 --> 01:37:33,915
Are suffering from unemployment.

1241
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,165
- I agree.
- No. I am sorry.

1242
01:37:35,250 --> 01:37:37,624
- Becoming a thief cannot be justified.
- She is also right.

1243
01:37:37,708 --> 01:37:39,165
He's asleep.

1244
01:37:46,083 --> 01:37:48,207
Bro. Bro.

1245
01:37:56,041 --> 01:38:01,499
- We know why you became a thief.
- Why?

1246
01:38:01,833 --> 01:38:05,499
- Because you're poor.
- And you don't have a job. Right?

1247
01:38:08,875 --> 01:38:09,790
Yes.

1248
01:38:10,041 --> 01:38:13,915
I'm poor, and I don't have a job.

1249
01:38:14,291 --> 01:38:15,957
Kundan, get a cup of tea.

1250
01:38:17,125 --> 01:38:18,665
Give me a cold drink.

1251
01:38:38,291 --> 01:38:39,612
Go ahead, I'll be right with you.

1252
01:38:47,375 --> 01:38:48,499
What now?

1253
01:38:52,583 --> 01:38:56,624
I'd rather work myself
to death here, than die of guilt.

1254
01:38:58,166 --> 01:39:01,040
And, I don't know why I'm here.

1255
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:07,124
Let me stay here. Please.

1256
01:39:13,125 --> 01:39:14,540
Nothing's changed.

1257
01:39:14,875 --> 01:39:17,499
Jasjeet's 'All India
Citizen's Party'..

1258
01:39:17,916 --> 01:39:20,082
Will still run in
the upcoming elections.

1259
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:22,415
His hard work can't go to waste.

1260
01:39:23,833 --> 01:39:26,540
I nominate Zoya as the new leader.

1261
01:39:27,041 --> 01:39:29,374
Those who agree, raise your hands.

1262
01:39:35,041 --> 01:39:37,082
So, we need to decide what's next.

1263
01:39:40,625 --> 01:39:42,124
We should do something..

1264
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:43,290
About the 'Bhatta Parsal' scam.

1265
01:39:43,375 --> 01:39:46,665
Around 4000 farmers
are losing their lands.

1266
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:48,249
Only to put up a factory.

1267
01:39:48,583 --> 01:39:50,249
The media must be present as well.

1268
01:39:51,708 --> 01:39:53,832
We can gain a lot
of political mileage.

1269
01:39:54,083 --> 01:39:56,832
Fine. Let's meet
here tomorrow at 11am.

1270
01:39:59,250 --> 01:40:01,290
The girl's got the spark.

1271
01:40:01,458 --> 01:40:03,124
We'll teach her the rest.

1272
01:40:03,208 --> 01:40:05,707
These are the basic
things in politics.

1273
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:12,582
- Zoya.
- I don't care a damn if he lives or dies.

1274
01:40:12,916 --> 01:40:14,874
There's nothing to
discuss about him, Rashmi.

1275
01:40:15,375 --> 01:40:18,374
There's much left to
do, and he doesn't exist for me.

1276
01:40:27,666 --> 01:40:30,040
Come on, give the tea.

1277
01:40:50,583 --> 01:40:58,583
"Don't look at me... like that."

1278
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:13,000
"Like you never saw me before."

1279
01:41:15,916 --> 01:41:19,499
He'll never learn.
Where are you going? Stop Kundan.

1280
01:41:19,583 --> 01:41:27,583
"Don't look at me... like that."

1281
01:41:35,125 --> 01:41:39,290
Load all the flags.

1282
01:41:41,708 --> 01:41:43,540
Anand.

1283
01:41:44,041 --> 01:41:46,915
- Take me along.
- What will you possibly do, Kundan?

1284
01:41:47,166 --> 01:41:48,957
Lend a helping hand.

1285
01:41:49,250 --> 01:41:53,040
- Or, serve you all tea.
- Climb on.

1286
01:42:09,375 --> 01:42:11,040
Come on. Who else?

1287
01:42:11,166 --> 01:42:12,249
Stand straight.

1288
01:42:12,416 --> 01:42:14,665
Don't let anyone come this side.

1289
01:42:14,791 --> 01:42:15,665
Be ready.

1290
01:42:15,791 --> 01:42:18,499
Shoot anyone you see. Get that.

1291
01:42:18,583 --> 01:42:20,040
No one.. Stand straight.

1292
01:42:20,625 --> 01:42:22,332
We're ready to talk.

1293
01:42:22,416 --> 01:42:25,124
Let us talk to your headman.

1294
01:42:25,458 --> 01:42:27,665
- The government will talk to you.
- You stay here.

1295
01:42:27,875 --> 01:42:30,957
- Who are you?
- What about the extra forces?

1296
01:42:31,125 --> 01:42:32,246
We want to meet the farmers?

1297
01:42:32,375 --> 01:42:35,249
Farmers? Who are you?

1298
01:42:35,333 --> 01:42:37,457
- Get lost!
- You cannot stop us.

1299
01:42:37,791 --> 01:42:39,374
Our party's running
for elections this year.

1300
01:42:39,458 --> 01:42:40,874
We're here to meet the
people of our constituency.

1301
01:42:40,958 --> 01:42:45,207
Ma'am. They've
kidnapped a PSE soldier.

1302
01:42:45,291 --> 01:42:47,290
And, they shot at
the DM's leg yesterday.

1303
01:42:47,375 --> 01:42:50,249
If they don't return that soldier,
they'll be shot.

1304
01:42:50,333 --> 01:42:52,665
You've an excuse to shoot them.

1305
01:42:52,791 --> 01:42:54,540
It's a golden opportunity
for this corrupt government..

1306
01:42:54,625 --> 01:42:55,746
To take away their lands.

1307
01:42:55,791 --> 01:42:57,165
You're raising your
voice at the wrong place.

1308
01:42:57,250 --> 01:42:58,040
Get that.

1309
01:42:58,416 --> 01:42:59,290
SP sir came.

1310
01:43:00,208 --> 01:43:02,707
Come on. Get lost.

1311
01:43:03,291 --> 01:43:05,915
- What's the position?
- The position's really bad.

1312
01:43:06,083 --> 01:43:09,540
Sir, we've seized the entire area.

1313
01:43:10,875 --> 01:43:14,624
Look. I give you five minutes..

1314
01:43:14,708 --> 01:43:16,249
The farmers were wrong.

1315
01:43:16,458 --> 01:43:17,698
They just gave the government..

1316
01:43:17,791 --> 01:43:19,040
An excuse to shoot them.

1317
01:43:19,125 --> 01:43:21,125
They'll just target the
main leaders and kill them.

1318
01:43:21,291 --> 01:43:22,957
And the government will say..

1319
01:43:23,125 --> 01:43:25,249
"We were only trying
to save the PSE soldier".

1320
01:43:26,583 --> 01:43:28,665
The people will blame the farmers.

1321
01:43:30,041 --> 01:43:31,582
We'll have to talk to the SP.

1322
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:33,915
- Anand.
- Yeah!

1323
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:36,874
Talk to the media. Tell them
about the situation going on here.

1324
01:43:37,166 --> 01:43:39,165
We'll have to take harsh action.

1325
01:43:39,708 --> 01:43:41,124
Sir, we know what
you're trying to do here.

1326
01:43:41,208 --> 01:43:42,499
We tried talking to them sir,
but they aren't listening, sir.

1327
01:43:42,583 --> 01:43:43,790
Sir, excuse me sir!

1328
01:43:44,333 --> 01:43:46,293
I know you must be following
your seniors orders..

1329
01:43:46,416 --> 01:43:47,540
But, you cannot do this.

1330
01:43:47,625 --> 01:43:50,165
Actually, I can do anything I want.

1331
01:43:50,375 --> 01:43:52,165
I can have you all arrested.

1332
01:43:54,458 --> 01:43:56,374
- Don't do this. Behave yourself.
- Move back.

1333
01:43:56,458 --> 01:43:59,040
- Please don't do this.
- Let us talk to them.

1334
01:43:59,083 --> 01:44:00,707
- This is the last warning for you.
- Move aside.

1335
01:44:00,833 --> 01:44:02,249
Sir, sir!

1336
01:44:03,083 --> 01:44:05,165
- Let us go inside.
- Sir!

1337
01:44:06,333 --> 01:44:08,040
Sir, I think you are a Tamilian.

1338
01:44:08,083 --> 01:44:10,207
Please, tell them to stop.
Sir, please listen to me.

1339
01:44:10,375 --> 01:44:12,624
If you wish, you can grant me
5 minutes permission.

1340
01:44:12,708 --> 01:44:15,332
Sir, please show some
mercy on me. Please, sir.

1341
01:44:15,416 --> 01:44:17,499
Unlike you, even they have
parents and everyone.

1342
01:44:17,958 --> 01:44:20,540
Please, sir. Sir, just give me 5
minutes time I'll get them out somehow.

1343
01:44:20,625 --> 01:44:21,665
If not, then you can do anything.

1344
01:44:21,791 --> 01:44:22,624
Please, sir.

1345
01:44:22,958 --> 01:44:25,624
Okay. Stop! Stop!

1346
01:44:27,916 --> 01:44:32,082
Only 5 minutes.
Do whatever you can. Go.

1347
01:44:32,458 --> 01:44:33,332
Thank you.

1348
01:44:45,291 --> 01:44:46,540
Kundan, be careful.

1349
01:45:29,041 --> 01:45:31,040
Bravo.

1350
01:45:36,291 --> 01:45:38,374
Bro, What?

1351
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:41,832
What did you tell the farmers?

1352
01:45:43,625 --> 01:45:44,499
Nothing.

1353
01:45:45,583 --> 01:45:49,165
I said "So you shot the DM,
that's alright".

1354
01:45:49,375 --> 01:45:51,999
"But this soldier's a poor man."

1355
01:45:52,166 --> 01:45:54,457
"His father's a farmer like you."

1356
01:45:54,875 --> 01:45:57,624
"if he dies,
his mother will curse all of you."

1357
01:45:57,708 --> 01:45:59,249
"And, you'll be ruined."

1358
01:45:59,458 --> 01:46:02,082
"Your rivers will run dry."

1359
01:46:02,166 --> 01:46:03,832
"Then you can keep your lands."

1360
01:46:04,333 --> 01:46:05,207
That's all.

1361
01:46:05,333 --> 01:46:07,790
That scared them,
and they let him go.

1362
01:46:08,083 --> 01:46:09,523
How do you come up with such things?

1363
01:46:09,625 --> 01:46:11,165
I'm a Pandit!

1364
01:46:11,250 --> 01:46:14,624
This is how I've been
living in Beneras for years.

1365
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,832
- You're a rascal.
- Top class.

1366
01:46:17,916 --> 01:46:18,624
Yes.

1367
01:46:18,708 --> 01:46:23,040
- We will win!
- AICP will win!

1368
01:46:23,125 --> 01:46:27,124
Vote for.. AICP!

1369
01:46:27,208 --> 01:46:28,207
- Vote for..
- AICP!

1370
01:46:28,291 --> 01:46:31,249
- Vote for..
- AICP!

1371
01:46:31,333 --> 01:46:32,707
Come along, sister-in-law.

1372
01:46:38,958 --> 01:46:39,790
Stop hitting us.

1373
01:46:39,875 --> 01:46:41,540
Have you lost your mind?
Why are you hurling slippers at us.

1374
01:46:41,791 --> 01:46:43,832
- Are you guys mad?
- Don't set foot in here.

1375
01:46:44,166 --> 01:46:45,082
Get lost.

1376
01:46:45,625 --> 01:46:47,290
We just want to talk.

1377
01:46:47,708 --> 01:46:49,249
We're against this
government as well.

1378
01:46:49,333 --> 01:46:50,540
We've formed a new party.

1379
01:46:50,625 --> 01:46:53,374
New or old,
you're just a bunch of thieves.

1380
01:46:53,541 --> 01:46:55,790
After the elections,
no one will even take a peek here.

1381
01:46:55,958 --> 01:46:57,665
I'll be damned if anyone does.

1382
01:46:57,791 --> 01:46:59,040
We just want to help.

1383
01:46:59,125 --> 01:47:03,165
Mother Teresa.
We don't want your help. Get out!

1384
01:47:03,458 --> 01:47:05,082
These rascals are here to help.

1385
01:47:05,541 --> 01:47:06,874
Hey! Keep that spade down.

1386
01:47:06,958 --> 01:47:08,718
Pick it up again and
I'll beat you to a pulp.

1387
01:47:09,208 --> 01:47:14,415
Better get going, or else
I'll start throwing slippers at you.

1388
01:47:14,791 --> 01:47:17,457
And humiliate you to death.

1389
01:47:18,416 --> 01:47:20,874
- Kundan, where are you going?
- Just forget it.

1390
01:47:21,625 --> 01:47:23,582
- Hey, what's this?
- Hey.

1391
01:47:23,875 --> 01:47:24,832
Don't create a scene.

1392
01:47:25,458 --> 01:47:27,332
Or else I'll beat you.

1393
01:47:28,958 --> 01:47:32,040
You're such pathetic rascals,
to show this anger so late.

1394
01:47:33,583 --> 01:47:36,832
Thirty years ago, if your
father had shown the same anger..

1395
01:47:36,916 --> 01:47:38,999
You wouldn't have
been living in this shit.

1396
01:47:39,958 --> 01:47:42,915
Yes, we're here
to ask for your vote.

1397
01:47:43,583 --> 01:47:44,915
So what's wrong in that?

1398
01:47:45,833 --> 01:47:48,313
You've been giving your vote
for the last 60 years, aren't you?

1399
01:47:48,958 --> 01:47:50,665
So, this time give your vote to us.

1400
01:47:51,958 --> 01:47:52,957
What's going to happen?

1401
01:47:53,708 --> 01:47:56,332
At the most, you'll be the fool.

1402
01:47:56,875 --> 01:47:58,415
But, that you still are.

1403
01:48:01,041 --> 01:48:02,874
So, shall we leave..

1404
01:48:03,083 --> 01:48:05,124
Or pick up the
shovel and help you.

1405
01:48:19,541 --> 01:48:22,124
The AICP members...

1406
01:48:22,208 --> 01:48:25,249
'The media had made us heroes,
so did fate.'

1407
01:48:25,333 --> 01:48:27,040
'This is when I realised..'

1408
01:48:27,125 --> 01:48:29,457
'..there's a huge dearth
of leaders in our country.'

1409
01:48:29,708 --> 01:48:32,332
'lf they were listening
to a uncouth like me..'

1410
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:34,040
'..they would listen to anyone.'

1411
01:48:34,333 --> 01:48:37,165
'But, I wasn't concerned
about the country.'

1412
01:48:37,375 --> 01:48:39,999
'All I cared about was me.'

1413
01:48:40,541 --> 01:48:44,374
'l was thinking,
if I can impress these AICP kids..'

1414
01:48:44,458 --> 01:48:46,415
'..then someday,
she'll see the light as well.'

1415
01:48:46,583 --> 01:48:48,915
'But, Zoya didn't like me one bit.'

1416
01:48:49,125 --> 01:48:50,665
'l was walking ahead,
and people were following me.'

1417
01:48:50,958 --> 01:48:52,790
'l was getting on her nerves.'

1418
01:48:53,375 --> 01:48:54,832
'But, I didn't realize..'

1419
01:48:55,041 --> 01:48:57,207
'..when my success posed
a threat to the government.'

1420
01:48:57,291 --> 01:49:00,624
AICP party members nearly
escaped from being badly beaten.

1421
01:49:00,708 --> 01:49:04,374
After the Bhatta Parsal incident,
this is another victory..

1422
01:49:04,458 --> 01:49:07,374
For AICP's youth
party in Sheelampur area.

1423
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:09,415
There's less than a
month for the elections.

1424
01:49:10,333 --> 01:49:12,040
They're gaining good mileage.

1425
01:49:12,208 --> 01:49:14,624
They'll certainly win 10-12 seats.

1426
01:49:15,250 --> 01:49:17,665
Put up tents all around this place.

1427
01:49:17,791 --> 01:49:19,082
And, all the tents..

1428
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,249
You don't need to
put up the tent, pal.

1429
01:49:22,458 --> 01:49:23,832
Work on your speech.

1430
01:49:23,916 --> 01:49:25,582
People only listen to you.

1431
01:49:26,208 --> 01:49:27,165
I will speak.

1432
01:49:33,958 --> 01:49:36,582
What's going on here?

1433
01:49:36,875 --> 01:49:37,582
Get out!

1434
01:49:37,666 --> 01:49:39,290
- Take these out.
- Why?

1435
01:49:39,708 --> 01:49:42,374
- We've official permission.
- What permission?

1436
01:49:43,041 --> 01:49:44,249
We're the official.

1437
01:49:44,833 --> 01:49:46,415
You don't have our permission.

1438
01:49:46,791 --> 01:49:48,290
- They can't just take it off?
- Take these out!

1439
01:49:48,375 --> 01:49:50,915
- Look, sir, we..
- Has the government stooped so low?

1440
01:49:51,583 --> 01:49:53,540
Don't touch me,
or I'll have to take action.

1441
01:49:53,708 --> 01:49:55,290
- Go ahead. Take action!
- Zoya.

1442
01:49:55,375 --> 01:49:56,957
- Beat us!
- Zoya.

1443
01:49:57,041 --> 01:49:59,040
- Stop, Zoya.
- Move back.

1444
01:49:59,125 --> 01:50:00,707
Sir, please try to understand.

1445
01:50:00,791 --> 01:50:03,082
Sir! Sir! Sir!

1446
01:50:03,416 --> 01:50:05,249
You shouldn't raise
your hand on women!

1447
01:50:07,041 --> 01:50:09,207
- Did you record that?
- Yes.

1448
01:50:09,791 --> 01:50:10,999
Do you want me to upload it?

1449
01:50:14,125 --> 01:50:16,082
That's okay. I'll handle it.

1450
01:50:16,791 --> 01:50:18,040
And, sir.

1451
01:50:18,416 --> 01:50:21,040
Even if we win 2
seats in the elections..

1452
01:50:21,125 --> 01:50:24,665
You'll definitely get transferred.

1453
01:50:25,125 --> 01:50:27,999
Sir. We get orders too.

1454
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:31,207
We've no personal enmity with you.

1455
01:50:32,250 --> 01:50:33,082
Sorry.

1456
01:50:36,208 --> 01:50:37,540
Whose orders?

1457
01:50:38,958 --> 01:50:40,832
Vinod Gupta.

1458
01:50:42,041 --> 01:50:44,374
We could've talked
to the inspector calmly.

1459
01:50:44,625 --> 01:50:46,415
Only 10 more days of campaigning.

1460
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:49,582
It's not a good idea to
get in a tiff with the police.

1461
01:50:50,416 --> 01:50:51,874
Come on, dear. Go home.

1462
01:50:51,958 --> 01:50:54,415
Study. Exams are close.

1463
01:50:55,791 --> 01:50:58,999
Him. He'll be the
leader of the masses!

1464
01:51:05,041 --> 01:51:07,707
Don't try to catch the
snake by the hood, Gupta..

1465
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,582
If it stings,
you'll be in deep trouble.

1466
01:51:13,083 --> 01:51:13,957
Let's go.

1467
01:51:14,958 --> 01:51:16,624
Where are you going, Mr. Gupta?

1468
01:51:16,708 --> 01:51:18,415
Let me tell you a joke.

1469
01:51:19,208 --> 01:51:22,040
Everything he does is right,
and what I do is wrong.

1470
01:51:22,541 --> 01:51:24,332
He's the undisputed
leader of the party.

1471
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:26,082
We'll need his permission
for everything, right?

1472
01:51:26,250 --> 01:51:28,874
He'll give the speech.
Help us win the elections!

1473
01:51:30,541 --> 01:51:32,624
Let me congratulate you Kundan!

1474
01:51:33,333 --> 01:51:35,374
You must be really happy, you dog!

1475
01:51:35,625 --> 01:51:37,040
What else do you need?

1476
01:51:37,375 --> 01:51:39,957
Now, you've the position
of the man you killed.

1477
01:51:40,083 --> 01:51:42,457
And, now you want his
girlfriend to sleep with, right?

1478
01:51:42,791 --> 01:51:43,999
What else do you want?

1479
01:51:44,708 --> 01:51:47,165
I never cried over Jasjeet's death.

1480
01:51:47,416 --> 01:51:51,207
I wanted to dedicate my
life to fulfil his last dream.

1481
01:51:51,666 --> 01:51:53,165
That's all.

1482
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,290
But, you can snatch that too.

1483
01:51:56,500 --> 01:52:01,874
Yes! He killed Jasjeet.
And you're cheering him!

1484
01:52:02,208 --> 01:52:04,582
Anand Srivastav!
This man killed him!

1485
01:52:04,666 --> 01:52:06,124
Go ahead, lick him!

1486
01:52:09,333 --> 01:52:11,207
You didn't just lose Jasjeet..

1487
01:52:11,291 --> 01:52:13,915
Or, you didn't lose just a friend.

1488
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,332
I lost my brother.

1489
01:52:15,416 --> 01:52:18,040
That means I get to kill him first.

1490
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:20,499
This man is our last hope.

1491
01:52:20,875 --> 01:52:22,332
You can choose power,
politics, position..

1492
01:52:22,416 --> 01:52:23,832
Over your brother's death.

1493
01:52:24,416 --> 01:52:27,540
Can you all forget the
man that formed this party?

1494
01:52:27,916 --> 01:52:30,040
His agenda wasn't just
winning the elections.

1495
01:52:30,708 --> 01:52:33,082
He had principles, he believed him.

1496
01:52:33,666 --> 01:52:36,249
And he died because of this man.

1497
01:52:39,708 --> 01:52:42,790
Honestly son,
my son passed because of you.

1498
01:52:42,875 --> 01:52:44,457
You made it possible.

1499
01:52:44,541 --> 01:52:46,624
- Police?
- Why are they here?

1500
01:52:52,041 --> 01:52:53,582
Come on, son. Apologise.

1501
01:52:55,666 --> 01:52:57,957
Apologise,
or we'll break your bones.

1502
01:52:59,041 --> 01:53:02,249
Mr. Gupta. I never even
apologised to my father..

1503
01:53:02,333 --> 01:53:03,582
When I made a mistake.

1504
01:53:04,625 --> 01:53:08,207
And now, it's not my mistake,
neither are you my father.

1505
01:53:10,333 --> 01:53:11,290
Beat him!

1506
01:53:13,291 --> 01:53:15,665
- Stop.
- Don't beat him.

1507
01:53:15,958 --> 01:53:18,290
Kundan, let him go.

1508
01:53:18,708 --> 01:53:20,082
Let Kundan go.

1509
01:53:24,208 --> 01:53:25,415
What are you thinking?

1510
01:53:26,833 --> 01:53:28,040
Say it.

1511
01:53:29,291 --> 01:53:31,332
Thankfully Zoya said everything.

1512
01:53:34,791 --> 01:53:36,332
I couldn't have.

1513
01:53:39,375 --> 01:53:40,999
I should leave.

1514
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:46,415
Look.

1515
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,457
There are two types of leaders.

1516
01:53:51,166 --> 01:53:54,374
One, that likes to
dissolve the government.

1517
01:53:55,708 --> 01:53:58,999
And the other,
who like to make a government.

1518
01:54:00,625 --> 01:54:04,165
I knew Jasjeet better
than these two women!

1519
01:54:05,083 --> 01:54:07,040
He was the second type.

1520
01:54:08,833 --> 01:54:09,915
Stay.

1521
01:54:10,708 --> 01:54:14,124
But, this time you've
got to do something.

1522
01:54:20,458 --> 01:54:23,499
Madam. That's a really
nice gift for Kapil.

1523
01:54:23,833 --> 01:54:25,040
But, think Gupta.

1524
01:54:26,041 --> 01:54:29,040
If he bites us only for his ego.

1525
01:54:29,250 --> 01:54:31,665
Pees over the 2015 budget.

1526
01:54:31,916 --> 01:54:34,874
And bites every
minister and official?

1527
01:54:38,250 --> 01:54:40,207
Sorry, madam. It was a mistake.

1528
01:54:40,291 --> 01:54:43,124
You've turned this into a chaos..

1529
01:54:43,208 --> 01:54:45,040
And say it's a mistake.

1530
01:54:45,291 --> 01:54:47,082
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

1531
01:54:47,166 --> 01:54:48,624
The next five years..

1532
01:54:48,791 --> 01:54:50,790
You will be handling
that dog, Gupta.

1533
01:54:51,041 --> 01:54:52,957
You've enjoyed too many
privileges for too long.

1534
01:54:53,291 --> 01:54:56,165
Santram, take me to St.
George's Hospital.

1535
01:54:56,250 --> 01:54:59,040
Will you tell me
what this is all about?

1536
01:55:00,333 --> 01:55:01,665
Start from the very beginning.

1537
01:55:02,208 --> 01:55:04,499
It's the first time police
has entered JNU Campus.

1538
01:55:04,583 --> 01:55:05,374
And, your reaction?

1539
01:55:05,458 --> 01:55:07,124
Who said it's the first time?
It's happened before.

1540
01:55:07,208 --> 01:55:08,665
Madam, yours is a political party.

1541
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:10,207
So, how can you operate
from a government institute.

1542
01:55:10,291 --> 01:55:11,665
The administration
doesn't have a problem..

1543
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:12,499
So, why do you?

1544
01:55:12,583 --> 01:55:14,832
Ms. Zoya, what was the
reason behind the scuffle.

1545
01:55:14,916 --> 01:55:16,624
Look. We are the victims here.

1546
01:55:17,875 --> 01:55:19,249
My friends are hurt.

1547
01:55:19,541 --> 01:55:21,082
Many have suffered broken bones!

1548
01:55:22,708 --> 01:55:24,874
Why don't you go to Mr.
Gupta's office?

1549
01:55:25,333 --> 01:55:27,665
Why not raise this question
outside the Parliament?

1550
01:55:27,875 --> 01:55:30,457
We'll give a reply.
But, not like this.

1551
01:55:31,291 --> 01:55:32,332
Not when we're beaten.

1552
01:55:32,791 --> 01:55:34,165
We'll do it on a stage.

1553
01:55:34,791 --> 01:55:36,124
And, on the top of our voice.

1554
01:55:38,291 --> 01:55:41,540
We're organizing a rally.
You're all invited.

1555
01:55:41,708 --> 01:55:43,207
- Thank you.
- Ma'am, please..

1556
01:55:56,125 --> 01:55:57,915
May I have a word with you, Zoya?

1557
01:56:00,541 --> 01:56:01,374
Alone?

1558
01:56:05,791 --> 01:56:07,499
Sad about Jasjeet.

1559
01:56:09,041 --> 01:56:10,624
I often heard about him.

1560
01:56:11,041 --> 01:56:13,957
I met him once.
At the IsC Conference.

1561
01:56:14,958 --> 01:56:17,790
- He was an intelligent boy.
- He did tell me.

1562
01:56:18,666 --> 01:56:20,267
He said you're quite
intelligent as well.

1563
01:56:23,333 --> 01:56:25,290
So, how can you be so stupid?

1564
01:56:26,958 --> 01:56:27,999
Miss Zoya is here.

1565
01:56:28,041 --> 01:56:29,957
Excuse me!

1566
01:56:32,708 --> 01:56:35,207
C.M came.

1567
01:56:40,875 --> 01:56:42,582
Name your price
for giving us Kundan.

1568
01:56:42,875 --> 01:56:45,165
Ask him to join our party.

1569
01:56:46,333 --> 01:56:49,124
I'm telling you because
you're close to him.

1570
01:56:50,833 --> 01:56:52,040
The party is Jasjeet's.

1571
01:56:53,416 --> 01:56:54,415
Kundan's the leader.

1572
01:56:54,625 --> 01:56:57,249
And, what about you? Nothing.

1573
01:56:58,500 --> 01:57:00,499
The reason your party
made it this far..

1574
01:57:00,583 --> 01:57:02,624
Was only because of Kundan.

1575
01:57:03,708 --> 01:57:04,915
Are you done?

1576
01:57:08,083 --> 01:57:09,249
Thank you.

1577
01:57:13,083 --> 01:57:14,207
Why did you feel hurt?

1578
01:57:16,291 --> 01:57:17,499
Did I say something wrong?

1579
01:57:19,583 --> 01:57:23,207
Zoya, Jasjeet would've
been really sad..

1580
01:57:24,333 --> 01:57:25,957
To see you in this condition.

1581
01:57:27,708 --> 01:57:28,665
Come on in.

1582
01:57:30,041 --> 01:57:30,832
Let's talk.

1583
01:57:39,333 --> 01:57:40,707
Just think about it, Zoya.

1584
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,999
Think. No pressure.

1585
01:57:43,208 --> 01:57:45,707
You know my house. Office too.

1586
01:57:46,083 --> 01:57:47,957
My secretary will
be in touch with you.

1587
01:57:48,500 --> 01:57:51,040
Let me know if you change your mood.

1588
01:58:13,375 --> 01:58:15,165
Everyone likes you, Kundan.

1589
01:58:16,958 --> 01:58:17,999
You're their hero.

1590
01:58:19,583 --> 01:58:20,540
Stay back.

1591
01:58:23,083 --> 01:58:24,415
They all need you.

1592
01:58:37,708 --> 01:58:44,540
“I don't want anything from you."

1593
01:58:45,125 --> 01:58:51,874
"No consolation, or faith."

1594
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:59,290
"No applauds, or sympathy."

1595
01:58:59,791 --> 01:59:06,249
"No dreams, no comfort."

1596
01:59:06,916 --> 01:59:07,790
Sorry!

1597
01:59:07,875 --> 01:59:15,875
"Don't look at me like this."

1598
01:59:21,500 --> 01:59:26,707
- Where's your husband?
- He's dead.

1599
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:31,457
Dead? There he is.

1600
01:59:38,583 --> 01:59:46,583
“I am the song... you
don't want to listen."

1601
01:59:51,666 --> 01:59:57,290
"The first leaf... fallen in Autumn."

1602
01:59:59,083 --> 02:00:06,165
"A drop of tear... in the desert."

1603
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:13,499
“I'm the moment that's passed."

1604
02:00:14,041 --> 02:00:17,082
"No way I can come back."

1605
02:00:17,166 --> 02:00:21,457
"That's true."

1606
02:00:22,208 --> 02:00:30,208
"Don't look at me... like
you never saw me before."

1607
02:00:36,541 --> 02:00:41,874
"Like you never saw me before."

1608
02:00:44,375 --> 02:00:49,040
"Don't look at me.."

1609
02:00:49,083 --> 02:00:51,374
Load these as well.

1610
02:00:51,458 --> 02:00:53,040
Who is calling now?

1611
02:00:53,125 --> 02:00:56,207
Kundan, answer the phone.

1612
02:00:57,333 --> 02:00:58,249
Anant.

1613
02:00:58,958 --> 02:01:00,582
Kundan and I are taking a rickshaw.

1614
02:01:01,083 --> 02:01:04,040
- You guys take the bus.
- Okay.

1615
02:02:14,958 --> 02:02:16,290
These are Jasjeet's clothes.

1616
02:02:20,041 --> 02:02:22,832
This Nehru jacket looked
really nice on him.

1617
02:02:24,375 --> 02:02:26,249
I couldn't see him make it this far.

1618
02:02:29,041 --> 02:02:30,499
So, why not you.

1619
02:02:32,333 --> 02:02:34,707
I couldn't help him prepare
for the battle.

1620
02:02:35,458 --> 02:02:36,874
So, why not you.

1621
02:02:41,333 --> 02:02:43,790
The first day I saw you in Delhi..

1622
02:02:44,666 --> 02:02:46,957
I wanted to hug you.

1623
02:02:48,875 --> 02:02:53,790
And ask... won't you do anything..

1624
02:02:55,333 --> 02:02:57,124
For the same Zoya
you slit your wrist.

1625
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:03,582
The world will spit on me
if I love you.

1626
02:03:06,875 --> 02:03:11,040
But look, I'm in love now.

1627
02:03:18,166 --> 02:03:19,290
You're looking nice.

1628
02:03:26,666 --> 02:03:27,665
Go on, Kundan.

1629
02:03:29,458 --> 02:03:30,957
Everyone's waiting for you.

1630
02:03:33,375 --> 02:03:36,332
Kundan, go!

1631
02:03:44,541 --> 02:03:46,499
You're doing everything so well..

1632
02:03:47,500 --> 02:03:50,040
Why did falter here now?

1633
02:03:51,125 --> 02:03:54,415
Zoya, you're trying to prove
a Muslim, Hindu again.

1634
02:03:56,458 --> 02:03:57,582
Control yourself.

1635
02:03:58,875 --> 02:04:00,207
No need to love me.

1636
02:04:03,625 --> 02:04:07,124
They're crazy, but you're smart.

1637
02:04:08,333 --> 02:04:13,124
I don't know what
you're trying to do..

1638
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,915
Or, where you're asking me to go.

1639
02:04:16,458 --> 02:04:18,915
But, I'll go anywhere you ask me to.

1640
02:04:21,583 --> 02:04:27,290
And I swear, I will win.

1641
02:04:28,625 --> 02:04:35,957
And, if you still
say you don't love me..

1642
02:04:43,583 --> 02:04:46,165
Then you can slap me 17 times.

1643
02:04:47,875 --> 02:04:55,875
Otherwise, I will take my 17 kisses.

1644
02:05:24,791 --> 02:05:26,374
'Everything can still be fixed.'

1645
02:05:26,708 --> 02:05:30,582
'You've to keep Kundan until
the last day of the campaign.'

1646
02:05:31,083 --> 02:05:33,624
'You just announced a big rally.'

1647
02:05:33,958 --> 02:05:37,207
'Yourjob is to bring Kundan
to that rally.'

1648
02:05:42,458 --> 02:05:43,957
'And according to the situation..'

1649
02:05:44,041 --> 02:05:45,999
'..you might win a few seats.'

1650
02:05:47,333 --> 02:05:50,207
'But, that's possible only
when Kundan's with you.'

1651
02:05:50,958 --> 02:05:53,790
'So, that face will help you win.'

1652
02:05:54,333 --> 02:05:57,874
'On the last day of
the campaign, finish him.'

1653
02:05:58,250 --> 02:05:59,790
'The police will pose no threat.'

1654
02:06:00,458 --> 02:06:05,165
'An small explosion can scatter
such gatherings.'

1655
02:06:11,458 --> 02:06:15,415
'Doesn't take long to start
a pandemonium.'

1656
02:06:44,791 --> 02:06:46,957
Hello madam, look.

1657
02:07:03,625 --> 02:07:08,249
'Doesn't take long to shoot
a bullet in such places.'

1658
02:07:18,833 --> 02:07:21,124
'And what's left behind? Seats.'

1659
02:07:21,583 --> 02:07:23,790
'You just need to
extend your support..'

1660
02:07:23,875 --> 02:07:25,624
'..to our party,
after Kundan's dead.'

1661
02:07:25,708 --> 02:07:27,624
'Who'll be the leader
of your party..'

1662
02:07:27,708 --> 02:07:29,624
'..of course, only you will decide.'

1663
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:35,415
'That will take care of your job,
and ours too.'

1664
02:07:36,375 --> 02:07:37,415
'Scores settled.'

1665
02:07:51,916 --> 02:07:54,415
How can they stoop that low?

1666
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:57,207
Some people believe
that Kundan's been shot..

1667
02:07:57,291 --> 02:08:01,374
While others believe
he's been badly beaten up.

1668
02:08:01,791 --> 02:08:03,874
Only time will tell us the truth.

1669
02:08:31,791 --> 02:08:34,249
Calm down! Please calm down!

1670
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:38,582
You all want to know..

1671
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:44,540
Whether we're involved
in the India Gate incident?

1672
02:08:46,250 --> 02:08:49,707
Well, the answer's right before you.

1673
02:08:50,333 --> 02:08:56,499
Can we hurt those we want
to make an alliance with?

1674
02:08:56,583 --> 02:09:01,040
Well, no leader can be that stupid.

1675
02:09:01,375 --> 02:09:02,374
Come, Zoya.

1676
02:09:02,833 --> 02:09:04,540
Come, share the big news.

1677
02:09:22,250 --> 02:09:26,290
The big news isn't
what the CM just announced.

1678
02:09:28,166 --> 02:09:29,540
The big news is that..

1679
02:09:30,375 --> 02:09:34,165
She's involved in the India Gate
incident that occurred today.

1680
02:09:39,416 --> 02:09:40,874
And, me too.

1681
02:10:09,208 --> 02:10:10,874
Her reasons obvious.

1682
02:10:12,291 --> 02:10:16,040
And, it'll take all
night to know mine.

1683
02:10:18,333 --> 02:10:20,832
By the way, I'm ready to go myself.

1684
02:10:22,625 --> 02:10:24,957
You can levy an inquiry on her.

1685
02:10:25,500 --> 02:10:27,832
And in 10-15 years,
when it's proven..

1686
02:10:29,125 --> 02:10:30,665
You can send her to me.

1687
02:10:33,666 --> 02:10:36,790
Now the scores are settled.

1688
02:10:46,666 --> 02:10:49,165
Ms. Zoya, is this some kind of
a conspiracy?

1689
02:10:49,250 --> 02:10:51,165
Is the government pressurizing you?

1690
02:10:51,250 --> 02:10:52,457
Tell us, madam..

1691
02:10:52,541 --> 02:10:55,707
You're lying, right?

1692
02:10:56,666 --> 02:10:58,290
How could Kundan go to that rally?

1693
02:10:58,375 --> 02:11:00,249
Because, I had informed him
in the morning..

1694
02:11:00,333 --> 02:11:01,874
That, there's
going to be an uproar.

1695
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,540
Can you take me there?

1696
02:11:29,416 --> 02:11:30,457
Move back!

1697
02:11:31,041 --> 02:11:33,040
You'll die, pal.

1698
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,082
Why endure all that..

1699
02:11:41,833 --> 02:11:42,790
Die.

1700
02:11:43,083 --> 02:11:50,499
Is the government pressurizing you?

1701
02:11:50,750 --> 02:11:52,207
Tell us, madam..

1702
02:12:00,583 --> 02:12:01,582
He's yours.

1703
02:12:03,291 --> 02:12:05,415
My Kundan never spat blood.

1704
02:12:06,416 --> 02:12:07,415
He's yours.

1705
02:12:33,541 --> 02:12:34,624
'That's it.'

1706
02:12:35,541 --> 02:12:37,415
'That was my story.'

1707
02:12:38,375 --> 02:12:40,332
'A girl sitting besides me.'

1708
02:12:40,583 --> 02:12:44,540
'Few doctors,
who were hoping to save me.'

1709
02:12:45,208 --> 02:12:47,082
'A friend, who was insane.'

1710
02:12:55,458 --> 02:12:59,124
'Another girl,
who dedicated her life to me.'

1711
02:13:01,416 --> 02:13:05,540
'My mom,
dad, and the lanes of Beneras.'

1712
02:13:06,500 --> 02:13:09,624
'And my body, that had left me.'

1713
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:13,040
'And my chest,
where the fire was still raging.'

1714
02:13:13,791 --> 02:13:15,999
'l could've got up, but for whom?'

1715
02:13:16,291 --> 02:13:18,124
'l could've screamed, but for whom?'

1716
02:13:18,791 --> 02:13:22,040
'My love, Zoya, Beneras,
Bindiya, Murari..'

1717
02:13:22,083 --> 02:13:23,707
'..they were all slipping away.'

1718
02:13:24,583 --> 02:13:26,332
'But, why would I
have stayed back for?'

1719
02:13:27,458 --> 02:13:32,040
'The fire inside me could've
kept me alive, or kill me.'

1720
02:13:32,583 --> 02:13:33,957
'But, why get up now.'

1721
02:13:34,166 --> 02:13:36,415
'Who's got the courage
to fall in love again..'

1722
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:37,707
'..suffer a heart-break.'

1723
02:13:38,541 --> 02:13:40,665
'Somebody stop me.'

1724
02:13:41,875 --> 02:13:44,832
'This girl besides me
with the blank stare..'

1725
02:13:45,083 --> 02:13:47,915
'..l can still get up for her.'

1726
02:13:49,041 --> 02:13:52,124
'But no.
I'm not in the mood anymore.'

1727
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:56,707
'It's better to close my eyes.
To get into deep slumber.'

1728
02:13:57,125 --> 02:13:58,624
'But, I will get up again some day.'

1729
02:13:59,166 --> 02:14:01,374
'To ring the tabor on
the banks of Ganges.'

1730
02:14:01,791 --> 02:14:03,540
'To run in those lanes.'

1731
02:14:05,083 --> 02:14:07,915
'To fall for some Zoya again.'

1732
02:14:35,291 --> 02:14:39,499
"To you. All the roads lead to you."

“I'll meet you. Only you. Only you."

1737
02:15:00,583 --> 02:15:08,583
"Fiery face. And the dark eyes."

1738
02:15:11,291 --> 02:15:13,707
"We fight and squabble."

1739
02:15:15,166 --> 02:15:17,707
"You seem to be mine. And
sometimes you seem like a dream."

1740
02:15:19,333 --> 02:15:23,665
"When you look at me."

1741
02:15:24,291 --> 02:15:32,291
"Your eyes pierce straight
through my heart."

02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:40,624
"You control my destiny."

1743
02:15:41,208 --> 02:15:49,208

"Only you. Only you. Sweetheart."

1745
02:16:05,583 --> 02:16:13,332
"All I want is you.
But it's all up to you."

1746
02:16:13,416 --> 02:16:17,457
"All my hardships
are limited to you."

1747
02:16:17,541 --> 02:16:21,665
"All my intelligence
is limited to you."

1748
02:16:21,750 --> 02:16:25,874
"All I prepare for is you.
Only you."

1749
02:16:25,958 --> 02:16:29,999
"Only you."

1750
02:16:30,041 --> 02:16:34,665
“I am smitten by you and you only."

"My smartness is limited to you."

1753
02:16:44,958 --> 02:16:46,957
"My youth is all for you."

1754
02:16:47,041 --> 02:16:49,040
"My smartness is limited to you."

1755
02:16:49,125 --> 02:16:51,040
"My youth is all for you."

1756
02:16:51,083 --> 02:16:53,207
"My story ends on you."

1757
02:16:53,291 --> 02:16:55,582
"My story ends only on you."

1758
02:16:55,666 --> 02:17:03,666
"Only you. Only you."

1759
02:17:20,875 --> 02:17:23,207
"Come. Come back to your love."

1760
02:17:23,791 --> 02:17:29,374
"Someone's waiting for you."

"For the better. For the better."

1763
02:18:01,041 --> 02:18:03,082
"There is chaos
and music everywhere."

1764
02:18:03,166 --> 02:18:05,165
"You've left to come to me."

1765

"My body is grooving.
My heart's thumping."

02:19:34,416 --> 02:19:38,665
“I'm so proud of myself.
I have lost control."

1782
02:19:38,750 --> 02:19:42,999
"Come and whisk me away."

1783
02:19:43,041 --> 02:19:47,124
"Come and take me
away with a smile."

1784
