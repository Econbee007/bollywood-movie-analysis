In a twinkle of an eye, a life-altering disappearance of her 7-year old kid brother sets Jhalki off on a mission to find him at all costs. Armed with an intimate folk-tale of a tireless sparrow and her own charming presence of mind, Jhalki embarks on a relentless journey to find and free her brother. Unaware and ignorant of the deep-rooted corruption and cobwebs of the system, Jhalki takes on the monstrous and the conniving with a purity of pursuit that is at once uplifting and inspirational. Is Jhalki's journey the start of a spiral that will change the lives of thousands for good? What price must she pay to get what she wants? Inspired by true events, with a backdrop of human-trafficking and child-labour, Jhalki becomes an atypical thriller of hope, courage, self-belief and perseverance in an inhuman world, seen through the eyes of a 9-year-old girl, who will not stop anywhere short of a triumph. With stunning visuals, breakthrough performances and a beautiful soundtrack, Jhalki is a heartfelt drama of love, adventure and intrigue, which is at once thought-provoking and poetic. Jhalki is Taare Zameen Pe meets Salam Bombay and Slumdog Millionaire, set in a fairy-tale which exists within each one of us.
