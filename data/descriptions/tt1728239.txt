After losing a huge sum to police officer Kabir Nayak, four slackers--Aditya Shrivastav, Boman Contractor, Manav Shrivastav, and Deshbandhu Roy--find themselves unemployed and broke. They come upon Kabir, who apparently lives a wealthy lifestyle now along with his wife Kamini, and sister Kiya. They intrude in his life, find out he is having an affair with a woman named Gulabo, and blackmail him into making them partners. They also rope in gangster-turned-Sadhu Bata Bhai into investing in an oil project, but are humiliated and go on the run after finding that Kabir has conned them. With an enraged Bata on their tail, the hapless foursome manage to escape to Macau with help from gangster Mohsin Bhai. Here they run into Kabir, now the owner of 'Four Jokers' Casino, and make elaborate plans to avenge their humiliation as well as ensure that he winds up alone and penniless.
