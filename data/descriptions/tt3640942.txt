Koyelaanchal (coal belt of India) brings to light the explosive story of the people who have kept our precious fuel station at ransom for centuries. Koyelaanchal unveils itself through Saryu Bhan Singh (Vinod Khanna),an ex-owner turned Mafioso of the region, who through his sheer brutality &amp; blatant defiance of law of the land, forces the people &amp; the authorities to acknowledge him as their 'maalik'. Any protest, any voice of dissent against him is dealt with spine chilling violence of epic proportions.
