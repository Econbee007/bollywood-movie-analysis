# Supplementary Ideas

To make this dataset more insightful and meaningful, here are a few additional attributes that could be added. Each of these could help us better understand not just what stories Bollywood films tell, but also how they’re received and who’s involved in telling them.

### 1. **User Reviews and Audience Sentiment**

Sometimes, what a movie tries to say and how people feel about it can be very different. Adding audience reviews and running sentiment analysis on them could help us compare public reaction to the themes we’ve already coded.

- **Where to get it**: IMDb reviews (via scraping or using IMDbPY), or even platforms like Rotten Tomatoes or Letterboxd.
- **How to use it**: We could extract text reviews, run them through basic sentiment analysis models like VADER or TextBlob, and then create an average sentiment score for each film.

### 2. **Cast Diversity (Gender, Religion, Nationality)**

Representation matters. Looking at who stars in these movies—across gender, religion, and nationality—can tell us a lot about inclusivity in the industry. This could also help us see if diverse casts are linked to different kinds of stories or sentiments.

- **Where to get it**: IMDb (using IMDbPY) for cast lists, and Wikipedia/Wikidata to gather demographic info about actors.
- **How to use it**: For each film, we could check the top-billed cast and record whether the group is diverse along different axes, creating simple indicators or diversity scores.

### 3. **Awards and Critical Recognition**

Awards and nominations signal what kinds of films the industry values. Including this information can help us explore whether certain themes or sentiments are more likely to be rewarded.

- **Where to get it**: Wikipedia pages for each film often list awards, or we could scrape IMDb’s awards section. For more structured data, award websites like Filmfare or National Film Awards may be useful.
- **How to use it**: Add columns like `won_award`, `num_awards`, or even break it down into `won_national_award`, `won_international_award`, etc.

Each of these additions would make the dataset richer and allow for more nuanced questions—like how representation links to recognition, or how public sentiment aligns with the messages a film is trying to convey.
